The  Secret  History  of  Codes  and  Ciphers — and 
How  They  Have  Clandestinely  Controlled  the 
Lives  of  Men 

"Codebreaking  is  the  most  important  form  of  se- 
cret intelligence  in  the  world  today,"  says  David 
Kahn — and  in  The  Codebreakers  he  relates  its 
story  fully  and  accurately  for  the  first  time.  Mr. 
Kahn  takes  the  reader  behind  the  closed  doors  of 
history's  "black  chambers"  and  describes  their 
workings.  He  tells  how  the  secret  activities  of 
cryptanalysts  have  often  determined  the  outcome 
of  battles  and  diplomatic  coups.  He  recounts  the 
impact  of  the  events  that  have  molded  modern 
cryptology,  portrays  the  outstanding  personali- 
ties of  the  science,  and  outlines  the  techniques — 
some  electronic — used  to  break  the  most  ad- 
vanced machine  ciphers.  His  story  stretches  from 
the  proto-cryptography  of  Khnumhotep  II  to  the 
speculations  of  scientists  on  how  to  solve  mes- 
sages from  outer  space.  But  the  best  part  of  the 
book  consists  of  its  innumerable  stories  about 
codes  and  ciphers,  such  as: 

• How  Germany  read  the  coded  messages  of  the 
United  States  State  Department  in  1942  and 
foiled  some  American  plans  in  North  Africa 

• How  the  weakness  of  Czarist  army  ciphers 
largely  enabled  Germany  to  defeat  Russia  in 
1917,  paving  the  way  for  the  takeover  by  Com- 
munists 

• How  John  F.  Kennedy  escaped  capture  in  the 
Pacific  because  the  Japanese  failed  to  solve  even 
a simple  cipher 

• How  Navy  cryptanalysts,  in  the  basement  of  a 
building  in  Hawaii,  fashioned  the  mid-air  assas- 
sination of  Japan's  number-one  warrior.  Admiral 
Yamamoto 

• How  Germany  eavesdropped  on  the  scrambled 
transatlantic  radiotelephone  conversations  be- 
tween Winston  Churchill  and  Franklin  D.  Roose- 
velt 

• How  cryptanalysis  determined  a presidential 
election 

• How  cryptanalysis  and  forgery  led  to  the  execu- 
tion of  Mary,  Queen  of  Scots

PREFACE 


codebreaking  is  the  most  important  form  of  secret  intelligence  in  the 
world  today.  It  produces  much  more  and  much  more  trustworthy  information 
than  spies,  and  this  intelligence  exerts  great  influence  upon  the  policies  of 
governments.  Yet  it  has  never  had  a chronicler. 

It  badly  needs  one.  It  has  been  estimated  that  cryptanalysis  saved  a year 
of  war  in  the  Pacific,  yet  the  histories  give  it  but  passing  mention.  Churchill’s 
great  history  of  World  War  II  has  been  cleaned  of  every  single  reference  to 
Allied  communications  intelligence  except  one  (and  that  based  on  the  Ameri- 
can Pearl  Harbor  investigation),  although  Britain  thought  it  vital  enough  to 
assign  30,000  people  to  the  work.  The  intelligence  history  of  World  War  II 
has  never  been  written.  All  this  gives  a distorted  view  of  why  things  happened. 
Furthermore,  cryptology  itself  can  benefit,  like  other  spheres  of  human 
endeavor,  from  knowing  its  major  trends,  its  great  men,  its  errors  made  and 
lessons  learned. 

I have  tried  in  this  book  to  write  a serious  history  of  cryptology.  It  is 
primarily  a report  to  the  public  on  the  important  role  that  cryptology  has 
played,  but  it  may  also  orient  cryptology  with  regard  to  its  past  and  alert 
historians  to  the  sub  rosa  influence  of  cryptanalysis.  The  book  seeks  to  cover 
the  entire  history  of  cryptology.  My  goal  has  been  twofold:  to  narrate  the 
development  of  the  various  methods  of  making  and  breaking  codes  and 
ciphers,  and  to  tell  how  these  methods  have  affected  men. 

When  I began  this  book,  I,  like  other  well-informed  amateurs,  knew  about 
all  that  had  been  published  on  the  history  of  cryptology  in  books  on  the 
subject.  How  little  we  really  knew!  Neither  we  nor  any  professionals  realized 
that  many  valuable  articles  lurked  in  scholarly  journals,  or  had  induced  any 
cryptanalysts  to  tell  their  stories  for  publication,  or  had  tapped  the  vast 
treasuries  of  documentary  material,  or  had  tried  to  take  a long  view  and  ask 
some  questions  that  now  appear  basic.  I believe  it  to  be  true  that,  from  the 
point  of  view  of  the  material  previously  published  in  books  on  cryptology, 
what  is  new  in  this  book  is  85  to  90  per  cent. 

Yet  it  is  not  exhaustive.  A foolish  secrecy  still  clothes  much  of  World 
War  II  cryptology— though  I believe  the  outlines  of  the  achievements  are 
known— and  to  tell  just  that  story  in  full  would  require  a book  the  size  of  this.

X THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Even  in,  say,  the  18th  century,  the  unexplored  manuscript  material  is  very 
great. 

Nor  is  this  a textbook.  I have  explained  at  length  only  two  basic  methods 
of  solution,  though  I have  sketched  many  others.  For  some  readers  even  this 
will  be  too  much;  them  I advise  to  skip  this  material.  They  will  not  have  a full 
understanding  of  what  is  going  on,  but  that  will  not  cripple  their  comprehen- 
sion of  the  stories.  For  readers  who  want  more  detail  on  these  methods,  I re- 
commend Helen  F.  Gaines’s  Elementary  Cryptanalysis,  partly  because  it  is  a 
competent  work,  partly  because  it  is  the  only  work  of  its  kind  in  English  now 
easily  available  (in  a paperback  reprint,  entitled  Cryptanalysis).  In  French, 
there  is  Luigi  Sacco’s  outstanding  Manuel  de  cryptographs  (the  Italian 
original  is  out  of  print).  Nearly  all  the  other  books  in  print  are  juveniles. 
Readers  interested  in  cryptanalysis  may  also  join  the  American  Cryptogram 
Association,  which  publishes  a magazine  with  articles  on  how  to  solve  ciphers 
and  with  cryptograms  for  solution. 

In  my  writing,  I have  tried  to  adhere  to  two  principles.  One  was  to  use 
primary  sources  as  much  as  possible.  Often  it  could  not  be  done  any  other 
way,  since  nothing  had  been  published  on  a particular  matter.  The  other 
principle  was  to  try  to  make  certain  that  I did  not  give  cryptology  sole  and 
total  credit  for  winning  a battle  or  making  possible  a diplomatic  coup  or 
whatever  happened  if,  as  was  usual,  other  factors  played  a role.  Narratives 
which  make  it  appear  as  if  every  event  in  history  turned  upon  the  subject 
under  discussion  are  not  history  but  journalism.  They  are  especially  prevalent 
in  spy  stories,  and  cryptology  is  not  immune.  The  only  other  book-length 
attempt  to  survey  the  history  of  cryptology,  the  late  Fletcher  Pratt’s  Secret 
and  Urgent,  published  in  1939,  suffers  from  a severe  case  of  this  special  plead- 
ing. Pratt  writes  thrillingly — perhaps  for  that  very  reason — but  his  failure  to 
consider  the  other  factors,  together  with  his  errors  and  omissions,  his  false 
generalizations  based  on  no  evidence,  and  his  unfortunate  predilection  for 
inventing  facts  vitiate  his  work  as  any  kind  of  a history.  (Finding  this  out  was 
disillusioning,  for  it  was  this  book,  borrowed  from  the  Great  Neck  Library, 
that  interested  me  in  cryptology.)  I think  that  although  trying  to  balance  the 
story  with  the  other  factors  may  detract  a little  from  the  immediate  thrill,  it 
charges  it  with  authenticity  and  hence  makes  for  long-lasting  interest:  for  this 
is  how  things  really  happened. 

In  the  same  vein,  I have  not  made  up  any  conversations,  and  my  specula- 
tions about  things  not  a matter  of  record  have  been  marked  as  such  in  the 
notes.  I have  documented  all  important  facts,  except  that  in  a few  cases  I have 
had  to  respect  the  wishes  of  my  sources  for  anonymity. 

The  manuscript  was  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Defense  on  March 
4,  1966. 

It  is  impossible  to  adequately  thank  all  those  who  have  helped  me  with 
this  book,  giving  generously  of  their  time  and  talents.  But  perhaps  I can  at

In  a larger  sense,  I owe  a great  deal  to  former  colleagues  on  Newsday, 
especially  to  A1  Marlens,  my  former  city  editor,  who  taught  me  most  of  what 
I know  about  reporting  and  writing,  and  also  to  Bernie  Bookbinder,  who 
demonstrated  that  concern  for  the  human  must  always  be  paramount;  to 
Stan  Isaacs,  who  showed  how  a subject  can  transcend  itself;  and  to  Stan 
Brooks,  whose  “Keep  it  light  and  bright!”  galled  me  at  the  time  but  has  since 
delivered  me — I hope — from  solemnity. 

The  errors  are,  of  course,  mine.  If  any  reader  cares  to  tell  me  of  any 
corrections  or  additions,  including  personal  reminiscences,  I shall  be  very 
grateful  to  him.

A FEW  WORDS 


every  trade  has  its  vocabulary.  That  of  cryptology  is  simple,  but  even  so  a 
familiarity  with  its  terms  facilitates  understanding.  A glossary  may  also  serv 
as  a handy  reference.  The  definitions  in  this  one  are  mformalandostensiv^ 
Exceptions  are  ignored  and  the  host  of  minor  terms  are  not  defined-the 

covers  these  when  they  come  up.  e T T n the 

The  plaintext  is  the  message  that  will  be  put  into  secret  form.  Usually  the 

plaintext  is  in  the  native  tongue  of  the  communicators.  The  messagemaybe 
hidden  in  two  basic  ways.  The  methods  of  steganography  conceal  the  very 
existence  of  the  message.  Among  them  are  invisible  inks  and  mtcrodote ^a 
arrangements  in  which,  for  example,  the  first  letter  of  each  word  in  an 
apparently  innocuous  text  spells  out  the  real  message.  (When  steganography 
is  applied^ to  electrical  communications,  such  as  a method  that  transmits 
long  radio  message  in  a single  short  spurt,  it  is  called  transmission  seeing) 
The  methods  of  cryptography,  on  the  other  hand,  do  not  conceal  the  prese 
of  a secret  message  but  render  it  unintelligible  to  outsiders  by  various  trans 

formations  of  the  plaintext.  _ . f i in 

Two  basic  transformations  exist.  In  transposition,  the  letters  of  the  plain- 
text are  jumbled;  their  normal  order  is  disarranged.  To  shuffle  secret  into 
ETCRSE  is  a transposition.  In  substitution,  the  letters  of  the  plaintext  are 
replaced  by  other  letters,  or  by  numbers  or  symbols  Thus  secret  mi8 
come  19  5 3 18  5 20,  or  xiwoxv  in  a more  complicated  system.  In  tran  p 
tion,  the  letters  retain  their  identities-the  two  e’s  of  secret  are  still  present  in 
etcrse — but  they  lose  their  positions,  while  in  substitution  the  ^ters  feta 
their  positions  but  lose  their  identities.  Transposition  and  substitution  may 

^ <Substitufion  systems  are  much  more  diverse  and  important  than  trans- 
position systems.  They  rest  on  the  concept  of  the  cipher  alphabet.  This  is  the 
list  of  equivalents  used  to  transform  the  plaintext  into  the  secret  form.  A 
sample  cipher  alphabet  might  be : 

plaintext  letters  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
cipher  letters  LBQACSRDTOFVMHWI  J XGKYUNZEP 

This  graphically  indicates  that  the  letters  of  the  plaintext  are  to  be  replaced

by  the  cipher  letters  beneath  them,  and  vice  versa.  Thus,  enemy  would  become 
chcme,  and  swc  would  reduce  to  foe.  A set  of  such  correspondences  is  still 
called  a “cipher  alphabet”  if  the  plaintext  letters  are  in  mixed  order,  or  even 
if  they  are  missing,  because  cipher  letters  always  imply  plaintext  letters. 

Sometimes  such  an  alphabet  will  provide  multiple  substitutes  for  a letter. 
Thus  plaintext  e,  for  example,  instead  of  always  being  replaced  by,  say,  16, 
will  be  replaced  by  any  one  of  the  figures  16,  74,  35,  21.  These  alternates  are 
called  homophones.  Sometimes  a cipher  alphabet  will  include  symbols  that 
mean  nothing  and  are  intended  to  confuse  interceptors;  these  are  called  nulls. 

As  long  as  only  one  cipher  alphabet  is  in  use,  as  above,  the  system  is  called 
monalphabetic.  When,  however,  two  or  more  cipher  alphabets  are  employed 
in  some  kind  of  prearranged  pattern,  the  system  becomes  polyalphabetic.  A 
simple  form  of  polyalphabetic  substitution  would  be  to  add  another  cipher 
alphabet  under  the  one  given  above  and  then  to  use  the  two  in  rotation,  the 
first  alphabet  for  the  first  plaintext  letter,  the  second  for  the  second,  the  first 
again  for  the  third  plaintext  letter,  the  second  for  the  fourth,  and  so  on. 
Modern  cipher  machines  produce  polyalphabetic  ciphers  that  employ 
millions  of  cipher  alphabets. 

Among  the  systems  of  substitution,  code  is  distinguished  from  cipher.  A 
code  consists  of  thousands  of  words,  phrases,  letters,  and  syllables  with  the 
codewords  or  codenumbers  (or,  more  generally,  the  codegroups)  that  replace 
these  plaintext  elements.  A portion  of  a code  might  look  like  this:

en- 

8808 

enable 

3043

0012 

enabled  to 

This  means,  of  course,  that  0012  replaces  enabled  to.  In  a sense,  a code  com- 
prises a gigantic  cipher  alphabet,  in  which  the  basic  plaintext  unit  is  the  word 
or  the  phrase;  syllables  and  letters  are  supplied  mainly  to  spell  out  words  not 
present  in  the  code.  In  ciphers,  on  the  other  hand,  the  basic  unit  is  the  letter, 
sometimes  the  letter-pair  (digraph  or  bigram),  very  rarely  larger  groups  of 
letters  (polygrams).  The  substitution  and  transposition  systems  illustrated 
above  are  ciphers.  There  is  no  sharp  theoretical  dividing  line  between  codes 
and  ciphers;  the  latter  shade  into  the  former  as  they  grow  larger.  But  in 
modern  practice  the  differences  are  usually  quite  marked.  Sometimes  the  two 
are  distinguished  by  saying  that  ciphers  operate  on  plaintext  units  of  regular 
length  (all  single  letters  or  all  groups  of,  say,  three  letters),  whereas  codes 
operate  on  plaintext  groups  of  variable  length  (words,  phrases,  individual 
letters,  etc.).  A more  penetrating  and  useful  distinction  is  that  code  operates

Cryptology  is  the  science  that  embraces  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis, 
but  the  term  “cryptology”  sometimes  loosely  designates  the  entire  dual  field 
of  both  rendering  signals  secure  and  extracting  information  from  them.  This 
broader  field  has  grown  to  include  many  new  areas;  it  encompasses,  for 
example,  means  to  deprive  the  enemy  of  information  obtainable  by  studying 
the  traffic  patterns  of  radio  messages,  and  means  of  obtaining  information 
from  radar  emissions.  An  outline  of  this  larger  field,  with  its  opposing  parts 
placed  opposite  one  another,  and  with  a few  of  the  methods  of  each  part

This  book  employs  certain  typographic  conventions  for  simplicity  and 
economy.  Plaintext  is  always  set  lower  case;  when  it  occurs  in  the  running 
text  (as  opposed  to  its  occurrence  in  the  diagrams),  it  is  also  in  italics.  Cipher- 
text  or  codetext  is  set  in  small  caps  in  the  text,  keys  in  LARGE  CAPS.  They 
are  distinguished  in  the  diagrams  by  labels.  Cleartext  and  translations  of 
foreign-language  plaintext  are  in  roman  within  quotation  marks.  The  sound 
of  a letter  or  syllable  or  word,  as  distinguished  from  its  written  form,  is 
placed  within  diagonals,  according  to  the  convention  widely  followed  in 
linguistics;  thus  /t/  refers  to  the  unvoiced  stop  normally  represented  by  that 
letter  and  not  to  the  graphic  symbol  t.

ONE  DAY  OF  MAGIC 


at  1 : 28  on  the  morning  of  December  7,  1941,  the  big  ear  of  the  Navy’s  radio 
station  on  Bainbridge  Island  near  Seattle  trembled  to  vibrations  in  the  ether. 
A message  was  coming  through  on  the  Tokyo-Washington  circuit.  It  was 
addressed  to  the  Japanese  embassy,  and  Bainbridge  reached  up  and  snared  it 
as  it  flashed  overhead.  The  message  was  short,  and  its  radiotelegraph  trans- 
mission took  only  nine  minutes.  Bainbridge  had  it  all  by  1:37. 

The  station’s  personnel  punched  the  intercepted  message  on  a teletype 
tape,  dialed  a number  on  the  teletypewriter  exchange,  and,  when  the  connec- 
tion had  been  made,  fed  the  tape  into  a mechanical  transmitter  that  gobbled 
it  up  at  60  words  per  minute. 

The  intercept  reappeared  on  a page-printer  in  Room  1649  of  the  Navy 
Department  building  on  Constitution  Avenue  in  Washington,  D.C.  What 
went  on  in  this  room,  tucked  for  security’s  sake  at  the  end  of  the  first  deck’s 
sixth  wing,  was  one  of  the  most  closely  guarded  secrets  of  the  American 
government.  For  it  was  in  here— and  in  a similar  War  Department  room  in 
the  Munitions  Building  next  door— that  the  United  States  peered  into  the 
most  confidential  thoughts  and  plans  of  its  possible  enemies  by  shredding  the 
coded  wrappings  of  their  dispatches. 

Room  1649  housed  op-20-gy,  the  cryptanalytic  section  of  the  Navy’s 
cryptologic  organization,  op-20-g.  The  page-printer  stood  beside  the  desk 
of  the  GY  watch  officer.  It  rapped  out  the  intercept  in  an  original  and  a carbon 
copy  on  yellow  and  pink  teletype  paper  just  like  news  on  a city  room  wire- 
service  ticker.  The  watch  officer,  Lieutenant  (j.g.)  Francis  M.  Brotherhood, 
U.S.N.R.,  a curly-haired,  brown-eyed  six-footer,  saw  immediately  from  indi- 
cators that  the  message  bore  for  the  guidance  of  Japanese  code  clerks  that  it 
was  in  the  top  Japanese  cryptographic  system. 

This  was  an  extremely  complicated  machine  cipher  which  American 
cryptanalysts  called  purple.  Led  by  William  F.  Friedman,  Chief  Cryptanalyst 
of  the  Army  Signal  Corps,  a team  of  codebreakers  had  solved  Japan  s en- 
ciphered dispatches,  deduced  the  nature  of  the  mechanism  that  would  effect 
those  letter  transformations,  and  painstakingly  built  up  an  apparatus  that 
cryptographically  duplicated  the  Japanese  machine.  The  Signal  Corps  had 
then  constructed  several  additional  purple  machines,  using  a hodgepodge  of

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


manufactured  parts,  and  had  given  one  to  the  Navy.  Its  three  components 
rested  now  on  a table  in  Room  1649:  an  electric  typewriter  for  input;  the 
cryptographic  assembly  proper,  consisting  of  a plugboard,  four  electric 
coding  rings,  and  associated  wires  and  switches,  set  on  a wooden  frame ; and 
a printing  unit  for  output.  To  this  precious  contraption,  worth  quite  literally 
more  than  its  weight  in  gold,  Brotherhood  carried  the  intercept. 

He  flicked  the  switches  to  the  key  of  December  7.  This  was  a rearrange- 
ment, according  to  a pattern  ascertained  months  ago,  of  the  key  of  December 
1,  which  op-20-gy  had  recovered.  Brotherhood  typed  out  the  coded  message. 
Electric  impulses  raced  through  the  maze  of  wires,  reversing  the  intricate 
enciphering  process.  In  a few  minutes,  he  had  the  plaintext  before  him. 

It  was  in  Japanese.  Brotherhood  had  taken  some  of  the  orientation 
courses  in  that  difficult  language  that  the  Navy  gave  to  assist  its  cryptanalysts. 
He  was  in  no  sense  a translator,  however,  and  none  was  on  duty  next  door  in 
op-20-gz,  the  translating  section.  He  put  a red  priority  sticker  on  the  decode 
and  hand-carried  it  to  the  Signal  Intelligence  Service,  the  Army  counterpart 
of  op-20-g,  where  he  knew  that  a translator  was  on  overnignt  duty.  Leaving 
it  there,  he  returned  to  op-20-g.  By  now  it  was  after  5 a.m.  in  Washington — 
the  message  having  lost  three  hours  as  it  passed  through  three  time  zones  in 
crossing  the  continent. 

The  S.I.S.  translator  rendered  the  Japanese  as:  “Will  the  Ambassador 
please  submit  to  the  United  States  Government  (if  possible  to  the  Secretary  of 
State)  our  reply  to  the  United  States  at  1 : 00  p.m.  on  the  7th,  your  time.”  The — 
“reply”  referred  to  had  been  transmitted  by  Tokyo  in  14  parts  over  the  past 
18^  hours,  and  Brotherhood  had  only  recently  decrypted  the  14th  part  on  the 
purple  machine.  It  had  come  out  in  the  English  in  which  Tokyo  had  framed 
it,  and  its  ominous  final  sentence  read:  “The  Japanese  Government  regrets  to 
have  to  notify  hereby  the  American  Government  that  in  view  of  the  attitude 
of  the  American  Government  it  cannot  but  consider  that  it  is  impossible  to 
reach  an  agreement  through  further  negotiations.”  Brotherhood  had  set  it  by 
for  distribution  early  in  the  morning. 

The  translation  of  the  message  directing  delivery  at  one  o’clock  had  not 
yet  come  back  from  S.I.S.  when  Brotherhood  was  relieved  at  7 a.m.,  and  he 
told  his  relief,  Lieutenant  (j.g.)  Alfred  V.  Pering,  about  it.  Half  an  hour  later, 
Lieutenant  Commander  Alwin  D.  Kramer,  the  Japanese-language  expert  who 
headed  gz  and  delivered  the  intercepts,  arrived.  He  saw  at  once  that  the  all- 
important  conclusion  of  the  long  Japanese  diplomatic  note  had  come  in 
since  he  had  distributed  the  13  previous  parts  the  night  before.  He  prepared  a 
smooth  copy  from  the  rough  decode  and  had  his  clerical  assistant,  Chief 
Yeoman  H.  L.  Bryant,  type  up  the  usual  14  copies.  Twelve  of  these  were 
distributed  by  Kramer  and  his  opposite  number  in  S.I.S.  to  the  President,  the 
secretaries  of  State,  War,  and  Navy,  and  a handful  of  top-ranking  Army  and 
Navy  officers.  The  two  others  were  file  copies.  This  decode  was  part  of  a 
whole  series  of  Japanese  intercepts,  which  had  long  ago  been  given  a

collective  codename,  partly  for  security,  partly  for  ease  of  reference,  by  a 
previous  director  of  naval  intelligence,  Rear  Admiral  Walter  S.  Andersom 
Inspired,  no  doubt,  by  the  mysterious  daily  production  of  the  information 
and  by  the  aura  of  sorcery  and  the  occult  that  has  always  enveloped 

crvptology,  he  called  it  magic.  , c

magic’*  solution  of  the  Japanese  one  o'clock  delivery  message 

He  then  busied  himself  in  his  office,  working  on  intercepted  traffic  until 
9-30,  when  he  left  to  deliver  the  14th  part  of  Tokyo’s  reply  to  Admiral 
Harold  F.  Stark,  the  Chief  of  Naval  Operations,  to  the  White  House,  and  t 
Frank  Knox,  the  Secretary  of  the  Navy.  Knox  was  meeting  at  10  a.m  that 
Sunday  morning  in  the  State  Department  with  Secretary  of  War  Henry  L. 
Stimson  and  Secretary  of  State  Cordell  Hull  to  discuss  the  critical  nature  o 
the  American  negotiations  with  Japan,  which,  they  knew  from  the  previous 
13  parts,  had  virtually  reached  an  impasse.  Kramer  returned  to  his  office 
about  10:20,  where  the  translation  of  the  message  referring  to  the  one  o clock 
delivery  had  arrived  from  S.I.S.  while  he  was  on  his  rounds. 

Its  import  crashed  in  upon  him  at  once.  It  called  for  the  rupture  of  Japan  s 
negotiations  with  the  United  States  by  a certain  deadline.  The  hour  set  tor 
the  Japanese  ambassadors  to  deliver  the  notification— 1 p.m.  on  a Sunday 
was  highly  unusual.  And,  as  Kramer  had  quickly  ascertained  by  drawing  a 
navigator’s  time  circle,  1 p.m.  in  Washington  meant  7.30  a.m.  in  awan  an

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


a couple  of  hours  before  dawn  in  the  tense  Far  East  around  Malaya,  which 
Japan  had  been  threatening  with  ships  and  troops. 

Kramer  immediately  directed  Bryant  to  insert  the  one  o’clock  message 
into  the  reddish-brown  looseleaf  cardboard  folders  in  which  the  magic 
intercepts  were  bound.  He  included  several  other  intercepts,  adding  one 
at  the  last  minute,  then  slipped  the  folders  into  the  leather  briefcases, 
zipped  these  shut,  and  snapped  their  padlocks.  Within  ten  minutes  he  was 
on  his  way. 

He  went  first  to  Admiral  Stark’s  office,  where  a conference  was  in  session, 
and  indicated  to  McCollum,  who  took  the  intercept  from  him,  the  nature  of 
the  message  and  the  significance  of  its  timing.  McCollum  grasped  it  at  once 
and  disappeared  into  Stark’s  office.  Kramer  wheeled  and  hurried  down  the 
passageway.  He  emerged  from  the  Navy  Department  building  and  turned 
right  on  Constitution  Avenue,  heading  for  the  meeting  in  the  State  Depart- 
ment eight  blocks  away.  The  urgency  of  the  situation  washed  over  him  again, 
and  he  began  to  move  on  the  double. 

This  moment,  with  Kramer  running  through  the  empty  streets  of  Washing- 
ton bearing  his  crucial  intercept,  an  hour  before  sleepy  code  clerks  at  the 
Japanese  embassy  had  even  deciphered  it  and  an  hour  before  the  Japanese 
planes  roared  off  the  carrier  flight  decks  on  their  treacherous  mission,  is 
perhaps  the  finest  hour  in  the  history  of  cryptology.  Kramer  ran  while  an 
unconcerned  nation  slept  late,  ignored  aggression  in  the  hope  that  it  would  go 
away,  begged  the  hollow  gods  of  isolationism  for  peace,  and  refused  to 
entertain — except  humorously — the  possibility  that  the  little  yellow  men  of 
Japan  would  dare  attack  the  mighty  United  States.  The  American  cryptanalytic 
organization  swept  through  this  miasma  of  apathy  to  reach  a peak  of  alert- 
ness and  accomplishment  unmatched  on  that  day  of  infamy  by  any  other 
agency  in  the  United  States.  That  is  its  great  achievement,  and  its  glory. 
Kramer’s  sprint  symbolizes  it. 

Why,  then,  did  it  not  prevent  Pearl  Harbor?  Because  Japan  never  sent 
any  message  saying  anything  like  “We  will  attack  Pearl  Harbor.”  It  was 
therefore  impossible  for  the  cryptanalysts  to  solve  one.  Messages  had  been 
intercepted  and  read  in  plenty  dealing  with  Japanese  interest  in  warship  move- 
ments into  and  out  of  Pearl  Harbor,  but  these  were  evaluated  by  responsible 
intelligence  officers  as  on  a par  with  the  many  messages  dealing  with 
American  warships  in  other  ports  and  the  Panama  Canal.  The  causes  of 
the  Pearl  Harbor  disaster  are  many  and  complex,  but  no  one  has  ever 
laid  any  of  whatever  blame  there  may  be  at  the  doors  of  op-20-g  or  S.l.S. 
On  the  contrary,  the  Congressional  committee  that  investigated  the  attack 
praised  them  for  fulfilling  their  duty  in  a manner  that  “merits  the  highest 
commendation.” 

As  the  climax  of  war  rushed  near,  the  two  agencies — together  the  most 
efficient  and  successful  codebreaking  organization  that  had  ever  existed — 


5 


One  Day  of  Magic 

scaled  heights  of  accomplishment  greater  than  any  they  had  ever  achieved. 
The  Congressional  committee,  seeking  the  responsibility  for  the  disaster, 
exposed  their  activity  on  almost  a minute-by-minute  basis.  For  the  first  time 
in  history,  it  photographed  in  fine-grained  detail  the  operation  of  a modern 
codebreaking  organization  at  a moment  of  crisis.  This  is  that  film.  It  depicts 
op-20-g  and  S.l.S.  in  the  24  hours  preceding  the  Pearl  Harbor  attack,  with 
the  events  of  the  past  as  prologue.  It  is  the  story  of  one  day  of  magic. 

The  two  American  cryptanalytic  agencies  had  not  sprung  full-blown  into 
being  like  Athena  from  the  brow  of  Zeus.  The  Navy  had  been  solving  at  least 
the  simpler  Japanese  diplomatic  and  naval  codes  in  Rooms  1649  and  2646  on 
the  “deck”  above  since  the  1920s.  Among  the  personnel  assigned  to  cryptan- 
alytical  duties  were  some  of  the  Navy  s approximately  50  language  officers 
who  had  served  in  Japan  for  three  years  studying  that  exceedingly  difficult 
tongue.  One  of  them  was  Lieutenant  Ellis  M.  Zacharias,  later  to  become 
famous  as  an  expert  in  psychological  warfare  against  Japan.  After  seven 
months  of  training  in  Washington  in  1926,  he  took  charge  of  the  naval  listen- 
ing station  on  the  fourth  floor  of  the  American  consulate  in  Shanghai,  where 
he  intercepted  and  cryptanalyzed  Japanese  naval  traffic.  This  post  remained 
in  operation  until  it  was  evacuated  to  Corregidor  in  December,  1940. 
Long  before  then,  radio  intelligence  units  had  been  set  up  in  Hawaii 
and  in  the  Philippines,  with  headquarters  in  Washington  exercising  general 
supervision. 

The  Army’s  cryptanalytical  work  during  the  1920s  was  centered  in  the  so- 
called  American  Black  Chamber  under  Herbert  O.  Yardley,  who  had  organ- 
ized it  as  a cryptologic  section  of  military  intelligence  in  World  War  I.  It  was 
maintained  in  secrecy  in  New  York  jointly  by  the  War  and  State  departments, 
and  perhaps  its  greatest  achievement  was  its  1920  solution  of  Japanese 
diplomatic  codes.  At  the  same  time,  the  Army’s  cryptologic  research  and 
code-compiling  functions  were  handled  by  William  Friedman,  then  as  later  a 
civilian  employee  of  the  Signal  Corps.  In  1929,  Henry  L.  Stimson,  then  Secre- 
tary of  State,  withdrew  State  Department  support  from  the  Black  Chamber 
on  ethical  grounds,  dissolving  it.  The  Army  decided  to  consolidate  and  en- 
large its  codemaking  and  codebreaking  activities.  Accordingly,  it  created  the 
Signal  Intelligence  Service,  with  Friedman  as  chief,  and,  in  1930,  hired  three 
junior  cryptanalysts  and  two  clerks. 

The  following  year,  a Japanese  general  suddenly  occupied  Manchuria  and 
set  up  a puppet  Manchu  emperor,  and  the  government  of  the  island  empire 
of  Nippon  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  militarists.  Their  avarice  for  power,  their 
desire  to  enrich  their  have-not  nation,  their  hatred  for  white  Occidental 
civilization,  started  them  on  a decade-long  march  of  conquest.  They  with- 
drew from  the  League  of  Nations.  They  began  beefing  up  the  Army.  They 
denounced  the  naval  disarmament  treaties  and  began  an  almost  frantic  ship- 
building race.  Nor  did  they  neglect,  as  part  of  their  war-making  capital,  their

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


cryptographic  assets.  In  1934,  their  Navy  purchased  a commercial  German 
cipher  machine  called  the  Enigma;  that  same  year,  the  Foreign  Office  adopted 
it,  and  it  evolved  into  the  most  secret  Japanese  system  of  cryptography.  A 
variety  of  other  cryptosystems  supplemented  it.  The  War,  Navy,  and  Foreign 
ministries  shared  the  superenciphered  numerical  hato  code  for  intercom- 
munication. Each  ministry  also  had  its  own  hierarchy  of  codes.  The  Foreign 
Office,  for  example,  employed  four  main  systems,  each  for  a specific  level  of 
security,  as  well  as  some  additional  miscellaneous  ones. 

Meanwhile,  the  modern-style  shoguns  speared  into  defenseless  China, 
sank  the  American  gunboat  Panay,  raped  Nanking,  molested  American 
hospitals  and  missions  in  China,  and  raged  at  American  embargoes  on  oil 
and  steel  scrap.  It  became  increasingly  evident  that  Nippon’s  march  of 
aggression  would  eventually  collide  with  American  rectitude.  The  mounting 
curve  of  tension  was  matched  by  the  rising  output  of  the  American  crypt- 
analytic  agencies.  A trickle  of  magic  in  1936  had  become  a stream  in  1940. 
Credit  for  this  belongs  largely  to  Major  General  Joseph  O.  Mauborgne,  who 
became  Chief  Signal  Officer  in  October,  1937. 

Mauborgne  had  long  been  interested  in  cryptology.  In  1914,  as  a young 
first  lieutenant,  he  achieved  the  first  recorded  solution  of  a cipher  known  as 
the  Playfair,  then  used  by  the  British  as  their  field  cipher.  He  described  his 
technique  in  a 19-page  pamphlet  that  was  the  first  publication  on  cryptology 
issued  by  the  United  States  government.  In  World  War  I,  he  put  together 
several  cryptographic  elements  to  create  the  only  theoretically  unbreakable 
cipher,  and  promoted  the  first  automatic  cipher  machine,  with  which  the 
unbreakable  cipher  was  associated.  He  was  among  the  first  to  send  and  receive 
radio  messages  in  airplanes.  As  Chief  Signal  Officer,  he  retained  enough  of  his 
flair  for  cryptanalysis  to  solve  a short  and  difficult  challenge  cipher.  He  was 
also  talented  in  other  directions:  he  played  the  violin  well  and  was  an  accomp- 
lished artist,  exhibiting  at,  among  others,  the  Chicago  Art  Institute. 

When  he  became  head  of  the  Signal  Corps,  he  immediately  set  about 
augmenting  the  important  cryptanalytic  activities.  He  established  the  S.I.S. 
as  an  independent  division  reporting  directly  to  him,  enlarged  its  functions, 
set  up  branches,  started  correspondence  courses,  added  intercept  facilities, 
increased  its  budget,  and  put  on  more  men.  In  1939,  when  war  broke  out  in 
Europe,  S.I.S.  was  the  first  agency  in  the  War  Department  to  receive  more 
funds,  personnel,  and  space.  Perhaps  most  important  of  all,  Mauborgne’s 
intense  interest  inspired  his  men  to  outstanding  accomplishments.  More  and 
more  codes  were  broken,  and  as  the  international  situation  stimulated  an 
increasing  flow  of  intercepts,  the  magic  intelligence  approached  flood  stage. 

Mauborgne  retired  in  September,  1941,  leaving  an  expanded  organization 
running  with  smooth  efficiency.  By  then  the  Japanese  had  completed  the 
basic  outline  for  a dawn  attack  on  Pearl  Harbor.  The  plan  had  been  con- 
ceived in  the  fertile  brain  of  Admiral  Isoroku  Yamamoto,  Commander-in- 
Chief  Combined  Fleet,  Imperial  Japanese  Navy.  Early  in  the  year,  he  had

One  Day  of  Magic 

ordered  a study  of  the  operation,  contending  that  “If  we  have  war  with  the 
United  States,  we  will  have  no  hope  of  winning  unless  the  United  States  fleet 
in  Hawaiian  waters  can  be  destroyed.”  By  May,  1941,  studies  had  shown  the 
feasibility  of  a surprise  air  attack,  statistics  had  been  gathered,  and  operational 
planning  was  under  way. 

In  the  middle  of  that  month,  the  U.S.  Navy  took  an  important  step  in  the 
radio  intelligence  field.  It  detached  a 43-year-old  lieutenant  commander  from 
his  intelligence  berth  aboard  U.S.S.  Indianapolis  and  assigned  him  to  re- 
organize and  strengthen  the  radio  intelligence  unit  at  Pearl  Harbor.  The 
officer  was  Joseph  John  Rochefort,  the  only  man  in  the  Navy  with  expertise 
in  three  closely  related  and  urgently  needed  fields:  cryptanalysis,  radio,  and 
the  Japanese  language.  Rochefort,  who  had  begun  his  career  as  an  enlisted 
man,  had  headed  the  Navy’s  cryptographic  section  from  1925  to  1927.  Two 
years  later,  a married  man  with  a child,  he  was  sent,  because  of  his  outstanding 
abilities,  as  a language  student  to  Japan,  a hard  post  to  which  ordinarily  only 
bachelor  officers  were  sent.  This  three-year  tour  was  followed  by  half  a year 
in  naval  intelligence;  most  of  the  next  eight  years  were  spent  at  sea. 

Finally,  in  June  of  1941,  Rochefort  took  over  the  command  of  what  was 
then  known  as  the  Radio  Unit  of  the  14th  Naval  District  in  Hawaii.  To  dis- 
guise its  functions  he  renamed  it  the  Combat  Intelligence  Unit.  His  mission 
was  to  find  out,  through  communications  intelligence,  as  much  as  possible 
about  the  dispositions  and  operations  of  the  Japanese  Navy.  To  this  end  he 
was  to  cryptanalyze  all  minor  and  one  of  the  two  major  Japanese  naval 
cryptosystems. 

His  chief  target  was  the  flag  officers’  system,  the  Japanese  Navy’s  most 
difficult  and  the  one  in  which  it  encased  its  most  secret  information.  From 
about  1926  to  the  end  of  November,  1940,  previous  editions  had  provided  the 
U.S.  Navy  with  much  of  its  information  on  the  Japanese  Navy.  But  the  new 
version — a four-character  code  with  a transposition  superencipherment — was 
stoutly  resisting  the  best  efforts  of  the  Navy’s  most  skilled  cryptanalysts,  and 
Rochefort  was  urged  to  concentrate  on  it.  The  other  major  system,  the  main 
fleet  cryptographic  system,  the  most  widely  used,  comprised  a code  with  five- 
digit codenumbers  to  which  were  added  a key  of  other  numbers  to  complicate 
the  system.  The  Navy  called  it  the  “five  numeral  system,”  or,  more  formally, 
JN25b — the  jn  for  “Japanese  Navy,”  the  25  an  identifying  number,  the  b for 
the  second  (and  current)  edition.  Navy  cryptanalytic  units  in  Washington  and 
the  Philippines  were  working  on  this  code.  Rochefort’s  unit  did  not  attack 
this  but  did  attack  the  eight  or  ten  lesser  codes  dealing  with  personnel, 
engineering,  administration,  weather,  fleet  exercises. 

But  cryptanalysis  was  only  part  of  the  unit’s  task.  The  great  majority  of 
its  100  officers  and  men  worked  on  two  other  aspects  of  radio  intelligence — 
direction-finding  and  traffic  analysis. 

Direction-finding  locates  radio  transmitters.  Since  radio  signals  are  heard 
best  when  the  receiver  points  at  the  transmitter,  sensitive  antennas  can  find 


8 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  direction  from  which  a signal  is  coming  by  swinging  until  they  hear  it  at 
its  loudest.  If  two  direction-finders  take  bearings  like  that  on  a signal  and  a 
control  center  draws  the  lines  of  direction  on  a map,  the  point  at  which  they 
cross  marks  the  position  of  the  transmitter.  Such  a fix  can  tell  quite  precisely 
where,  for  example,  a ship  is  operating.  Successive  fixes  can  plot  its  course 
and  speed. 

To  exploit  this  source  of  information,  the  Navy  in  1937  established  the 
Mid-Pacific  Strategic  Direction-Finder  Net.  By  1941,  high-frequency  direc- 
tion-finders curved  in  a gigantic  arc  from  Cavite  in  the  Philippines  through 
Guam,  Samoa,  Midway,  and  Hawaii  to  Dutch  Harbor,  Alaska.  The  60  or  70 
officers  and  men  who  staffed  these  outposts  reported  their  bearings  to  Hawaii, 
where  Rochefort’s  unit  translated  them  into  fixes.  For  example,  on  October 
16,  the  ship  with  call-sign  kuna  1 was  located  at  10.7  degrees  north  latitude, 
166.7  degrees  east  longitude — or  within  Japan’s  mandated  islands. 

These  findings  did  not  serve  merely  to  keep  an  eye  on  the  day-to-day 
locations  of  Japanese  warships.  They  also  formed  the  basis  of  the  even  more 
fruitful  technique  of  traffic  analysis.  Traffic  analysis  deduces  the  lines  of 
command  of  military  or  naval  forces  by  ascertaining  which  radios  talk  to 
which.  And  since  military  operations  are  usually  accompanied  by  an  increase 
in  communications,  traffic  analysis  can  infer  the  imminence  of  such  operations 
by  watching  the  volume  of  traffic.  When  combined  with  direction-finding,  it 
can  often  approximate  the  where  and  when  of  a planned  movement. 

Radio  intelligence  thus  maintains  a long-range,  invisible,  and  continuous 
surveillance  of  fleet  movements  and  organization,  providing  a wealth  of 
information  at  a low  cost.  Of  course  it  has  its  limitations.  A change  of  the  call- 
signs  of  radio  transmitters  can  hinder  it.  The  sending  of  fictitious  messages 
can  befuddle  it.  Radio  silences  can  deafen  it.  But  it  cannot  be  wholly  pre- 
vented except  by  unacceptable  restrictions  on  communications.  Hence  the 
Navy  relied  increasingly  on  it  for  its  information  on  Japanese  naval  activities 
as  security  tightened  in  Japan  during  1941,  and  almost  exclusively  after  July, 
when  the  President’s  trade-freezing  order  deprived  the  Navy  of  all  visual 
observations  of  Japanese  ships  not  on  the  China  coast. 

It  was  in  July  that  a Japanese  tactic  set  up  a radio  pattern  that  was  later 
to  deceive  the  Combat  Intelligence  Unit.  The  Nipponese  militarists  had 
decided  to  take  advantage  of  France’s  defeat  and  occupy  French  Indochina. 
The  naval  preparations  for  the  successful  grab  were  clearly  indicated  in  the 
radio  traffic,  which  went  through  the  usual  three  stages  that  preceded  major 
Japanese  operations.  First  appeared  a heavy  flurry  of  messages.  The  Com- 
mander-in-Chief  Combined  Fleet  busily  originated  traffic,  talking  with  many 
commands  to  the  south,  thereby  indicating  the  probable  direction  of  his 
advance.  Then  came  a realignment  of  forces.  In  the  lingo  of  the  tranalysis 
people,  certain  chickens  (fleet  units)  no  longer  had  their  old  mothers  (fleet  com- 
manders). Call-sign  nota  4,  which  usually  communicated  with  oyo  8,  now 
talked  mostly  with  oru  6.  Accompanying  this  was  a considerable  confusion 


9 


One  Day  of  Magic 

in  the  routing  of  messages,  with  frequent  retransmissions  caused  by  the  re- 
grouping: Admiral  z not  here;  try  Second  Fleet.  Then  followed  the  third 
phase:  radio  silence.  The  task  force  was  now  under  way.  Messages  would  be 
addressed  to  it,  but  none  would  emanate  from  it. 

During  all  this,  however,  not  only  were  no  messages  heard  from  the  air- 
craft carriers,  none  were  sent  to  them,  either.  This  blank  condition  exceeded 
radio  silence,  which  suppresses  traffic  in  only  one  direction — from  the  mobile 
force— not  in  both.  American  intelligence  reasoned  that  the  carriers  were 
standing  by  in  home  waters  as  a covering  force  in  case  of  counterattack,  and 
that  communications  both  to  and  from  them  were  not  heard  because  they  were 
being  sent  out  by  short-range,  low-powered  transmissions  that  died  away 
before  reaching  American  receivers.  Such  a blank  condition  had  obtained  in  a 
similar  tactical  situation  in  February.  American  intelligence  had  drawn  the 
same  conclusions  then  and  had  been  proven  right.  Events  soon  confirmed  the 
July  assessment  as  well.  Twice,  then,  a complete  blank  of  carrier  communica- 
tions combined  with  indications  of  a strong  southward  thrust  had  meant  the 
presence  of  the  carriers  in  Empire  waters.  But  what  happened  in  February 
and  July  was  not  necessarily  what  would  happen  in  December. 

During  the  summer  and  fall  of  1941,  the  pressure  of  events  molded 
America’s  two  cryptanalytic  agencies  closer  and  closer  to  the  form  they  were 
to  have  on  December  7.  The  Signal  Intelligence  Service,  which  had  181  officers, 
enlisted  men,  and  civilians  in  Washington  and  150  at  intercept  stations  in  the 
field  on  Pearl  Harbor  Day,  had  been  headed  since  March  by  Lieutenant 
Colonel  Rex  W.  Minckler,  a career  Signal  Corps  officer.  Friedman  served  as 
his  chief  technical  assistant.  S.I.S.  comprised  the  Signal  Intelligence  School, 
which  trained  Regular  Army  and  Reserve  officers  in  cryptology,  the  2nd 
Signal  Service  Company,  which  staffed  the  intercept  posts,  and  four  Washing- 
ton sections  of  the  S.I.S.  proper:  the  a,  or  administrative,  which  also  operated 
the  tabulating  machinery;  the  b,  or  cryptanalytic;  the  c,  or  cryptographic, 
which  prepared  new  U.S.  Army  systems,  studied  the  current  systems  for 
security,  and  monitored  Army  traffic  for  security  violations;  and  the  d,  or 
laboratory,  which  concocted  secret  inks  and  tested  suspected  documents. 

The  b section,  under  Major  Harold  S.  Doud,  a West  Point  graduate,  had 
as  its  mission  the  solution  of  the  military  and  diplomatic  systems  not  only  of 
Japan  but  of  other  countries.  In  this  it  apparently  achieved  at  least  a fair 
success,  though  no  Japanese  military  systems — the  chief  of  which  was  a code 
employing  four-digit  codenumbers — were  readable  by  December  7 because 
of  a paucity  of  material.  Doud’s  technical  assistant  was  a civilian,  Frank  B. 
Rowlett,  one  of  the  three  original  junior  cryptanalysts  hired  in  1930.  The 
military  man  in  charge  of  Japanese  diplomatic  solutions  was  Major  Eric 
Svensson. 

The  Navy’s  official  designation  of  op-20-g  indicated  that  the  agency  was 
the  G section  of  the  20th  division  of  opnav,  the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Naval 


10 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Operations,  the  Navy’s  headquarters  establishment.  The  20th  division  was  the 
Office  of  Naval  Communications,  and  the  G section  was  the  Communication 
Security  Section.  This  carefully  chosen  name  masked  its  cryptanalytic  activi- 
ties, though  its  duties  did  include  U.S.  Navy  cryptography. 

Its  chief  was  Commander  Laurence  F.  Safford,  48,  a tall,  blond  Annapolis 
graduate  who  was  the  Navy’s  chief  expert  in  cryptology.  In  January,  1924,  he 
had  become  the  officer  in  charge  of  the  newly  created  research  desk  in  the 
Navy’s  Code  and  Signal  Section.  Here  he  founded  the  Navy’s  communica- 
tion-intelligence organization.  After  sea  duty  from  1926  to  1929,  he  returned 
to  cryptologic  activities  for  three  more  years,  when  sea  duty  was  again  made 
necessary  by  the  “Manchu”  laws,  which  required  officers  of  the  Army  and 
Navy  to  serve  in  the  field  or  at  sea  to  win  promotion.  He  took  command  of 
op-20-g  in  1936.  One  of  his  principal  accomplishments  before  the  outbreak 
of  war  was  the  establishment  of  the  Mid-Pacific  Strategic  Direction-Finder 
Net  and  of  a similar  net  for  the  Atlantic,  where  it  was  to  play  a role  of  immense 
importance  in  the  Battle  of  the  Atlantic  against  the  U-boats. 

Safford's  organization  enjoyed  broad  cryptologic  functions.  It  printed  new 
editions  of  codes  and  ciphers  and  distributed  them,  and  contracted  with 
manufacturers  for  cipher  machines.  It  developed  new  systems  for  the  Navy. 
It  comprehended  such  subsections  as  gi,  which  wrote  reports  based  on  radio 
intelligence  from  the  field  units,  and  gl,  a record-keeping  and  historical- 
research  group.  But  its  main  interest  centered  on  cryptanalysis. 

This  activity  was  distributed  among  units  in  Washington,  Hawaii,  and  the 
Philippines.  Only  Washington  attacked  foreign  diplomatic  systems  and  naval 
codes  used  in  the  Atlantic  theater  (primarily  German).  Rochefort  had  primary 
responsibility  for  the  Japanese  naval  systems.  The  Philippines  chipped  away 
at  jn25  and  did  some  diplomatic  deciphering,  with  keys  provided  by  Washing- 
ton. That  unit,  which  like  Rochefort’s  was-  attached  for  administrative  pur- 
poses to  the  local  naval  district  (the  16th),  was  installed  in  a tunnel  of  the 
island  fortress  of  Corregidor.  It  was  equipped  with  26  radio  receivers, 
apparatus  for  intercepting  both  high-  and  low-speed  transmissions,  a direc- 
tion-finder, and  tabulating  machinery.  Lieutenant  Rudolph  J.  Fabian,  33,  an 
Annapolis  graduate  who  had  had  three  years  of  communication  intelligence 
in  Washington  and  the  Philippines,  commanded.  The  7 officers  and  19  men  in 
his  cryptanalytic  group  exchanged  possible  recoveries  of  JN25b  codegroups 
with  Washington  and  with  a British  group  in  Singapore;  each  group  also  had 
a liaison  man  with  the  other. 

Of  the  Navy’s  total  radio-intelligence  establishment  of  about  700  officers 
and  men,  two  thirds  were  engaged  in  intercept  or  direction-finding  activities 
and  one  third— including  most  of  the  80  officers— in  cryptanalysis  and  transla- 
tion. Safford  sized  up  the  personnel  of  his  three  units  this  way:  Pearl  Harbor 
had  some  of  the  best  officers,  most  of  whom  had  four  or  five  years  of  radio 
intelligence  experience;  the  crew  at  Corregidor,  which  in  general  had  only 
two  or  three  years’  experience,  was  “young,  enthusiastic,  and  capable”; 


11 


One  Day  of  Magic 

Washington — responsible  for  both  overall  supervision  and  training — had 
some  of  the  most  experienced  personnel,  with  more  than  ten  years’  ex- 
perience, and  many  of  the  least ; 90  per  cent  of  the  unit  had  less  than  a year’s 
experience. 

Under  Safford  in  the  three  subsections  most  closely  involved  with  crypt- 
analysis were  Lieutenant  Commanders  George  W.  Welker  of  gx,  the  intercept 
and  direction-finding  subsection,  Lee  W.  Parke  of  gy,  the  cryptanalytical 
subsection,  and  Kramer  of  gz,  the  translation  and  dissemination  subsection. 
gy  attacked  new  systems  and  recovered  new  keys  for  solved  systems,  such 
as  purple.  But  while  it  made  the  initial  breaks  in  code  solutions,  the  detailed 
recovery  of  codegroups  (which  was  primarily  a linguistic  problem  as  com- 
pared to  the  more  mathematical  cipher  solutions)  was  left  to  gz.  Four 
officers  in  gy,  assisted  by  chief  petty  officers,  stood  round-the-clock  watches. 
Senior  watch  officer  was  Lieutenant  (j.g.)  George  W.  Lynn;  the  others  were 
Lieutenants  (j.g.)  Brotherhood,  Pering,  and  Allan  A.  Murray.  GY  had  others 
on  its  staff,  such  as  girl  typists  who  also  did  the  simple  deciphering  of  some 
diplomatic  messages  after  the  watch  officers  and  other  cryptanalysts  had 
found  the  keys. 

Kramer  was  in  an  odd  position.  Though  he  worked  in  op-20-gz,  he  was 
formally  attached  to  op-16-f2 — the  Far  Eastern  Section  of  the  Office  of  Naval 
Intelligence.  This  arrangement  was  intended  in  part  to  throw  off  the  Japanese, 
who  might  have  inferred  some  measure  of  success  in  codebreaking  if  a 
Japanese-language  officer  like  Kramer  were  assigned  to  communications,  in 
part  to  have  an  officer  with  a broad  intelligence  background  distribute  magic 
so  that  he  could  answer  the  recipients’  questions.  Kramer,  38,  who  had  studied 
in  Japan  from  1931  to  1934,  had  had  two  tours  in  O.N.I.  proper  before  being 
assigned  full  time  to  gz  in  June,  1940.  An  Annapolis  graduate,  chess  fan,  and 
rifle  marksman,  he  lived  in  a world  in  which  everything  had  one  right  way  to 
be  done.  He  chose  his  words  with  almost  finicky  exactness  (one  of  his  favorites 
was  “precise”);  he  kept  his  pencil  mustache  trimmed  to  a hair;  he  filed  his 
papers  tidily;  he  often  studied  his  magic  intercepts  several  times  over  before 
delivering  them.  Included  in  this  philosophy  was  his  duty.  He  performed  it 
with  great  responsibility,  intelligence,  and  dedication. 

The  first  task  of  op-20-g  and  of  S.I.S.  was  to  obtain  raw  material  for  the 
cryptanalysts.  And  in  peacetime  America  that  was  not  easy. 

Section  605  of  the  Federal  Communications  Act  of  1934,  which  prohibits 
wiretaps,  also  prohibits  the  interception  of  messages  between  foreign 
countries  and  the  United  States  and  territories.  General  Malin  Craig,  Chief 
of  Staff  from  1937  to  1939,  was  acutely  aware  of  this,  and  his  attitude  damp- 
ened efforts  to  intercept  the  Japanese  diplomatic  messages  coming  into 
America.  But  after  General  George  C.  Marshall  succeeded  to  Craig’s  post, 
the  exigencies  of  national  defense  relegated  that  problem  in  his  mind  to  the 
status  of  a legalistic  quibble.  The  cryptanalytic  agencies  pressed  ahead  in 


12 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


their  intercept  programs.  The  extreme  secrecy  in  which  they  were  cloaked 
helped  them  avoid  detection.  They  concentrated  on  radio  messages,  since  the 
cable  companies,  fully  cognizant  of  the  legal  restrictions,  in  general  refused  to 
turn  over  any  foreign  communications  to  them.  Consequently,  95  per  cent  of 
the  intercepts  were  radio  messages.  The  remainder  was  split  between  cable 
intercepts  and  photographs  of  messages  on  file  at  a few  cooperative  cable 
offices. 

To  pluck  the  messages  from  the  airwaves,  the  Navy  relied  mainly  on  its 
listening  posts  at  Bainbridge  Island  in  Puget  Sound;  Winter  Harbor,  Maine; 
Cheltenham,  Maryland;  Heeia,  Oahu;  and  Corregidor  and  to  a lesser  degree 
on  stations  at  Guam;  Imperial  Beach,  California;  Amagansett,  Long  Island 
and  Jupiter,  Florida.  Each  station  was  assigned  certain  frequencies  to  cover. 
Bainbridge  Island,  which  was  called  Station  S,  copied  solid  the  schedule  of 
Japanese  government  messages  between  Tokyo  and  San  Francisco.  Its  two 
sound  recorders  guarded  the  radiotelephone  band  of  that  circuit;  presumably 
it  was  equipped  to  unscramble  the  relatively  simple  sound  inversion  that  then 
provided  privacy  from  casual  eavesdropping.  Diplomatic  messages  were 
transmitted  almost  exclusively  by  commercial  radio  using  roman  letters. 
The  naval  radiograms,  however,  employed  the  special  Morse  code  devised 
for  kata  kana,  a syllabic  script  of  Japanese.  The  Navy  picked  these  up  with 
operators  trained  in  Japanese  Morse  and  recorded  them  on  a special  type- 
writer that  it  had  developed  for  the  roman-letter  equivalents  of  the  kana 
characters.  The  Army’s  stations,  called  Monitor  Posts,  were:  No.  1,  Fort 
Hancock,  New  Jersey;  No.  2,  San  Francisco;  No.  3,  Fort  Sam  Houston,  San 
Antonio;  No.  4,  Panama;  No.  5,  Fort  Shafter,  Honolulu;  No.  6,  Fort  Mills, 
Manila;  No.  7,  Fort  Hunt,  Virginia;  No.  9,  Rio  de  Janeiro. 

At  first  both  services  airmailed  messages  from  their  intercept  posts  to 
Washington.  But  this  proved  too  slow.  The  Pan-American  Clipper,  which 
carried  Army  intercepts  from  Hawaii  to  the  mainland,  departed  only  once  a 
week  on  the  average,  and  weather  sometimes  caused  cancellations,  forcing 
messages  to  be  sent  by  ship.  As  late  as  the  week  before  Pearl  Harbor,  two 
Army  intercepts  from  Rio  did  not  reach  Washington  for  eleven  days.  Such 
delays  compelled  the  Navy  to  install  teletypewriter  service  in  1941  between 
Washington  and  its  intercept  stations  in  the  continental  U.S.  The  station 
would  perforate  a batch  of  intercepts  onto  a teletype  tape,  connect  with 
Washington  through  a teletypewriter  exchange,  and  run  the  tape  through 
mechanically  at  60  words  per  minute,  cutting  toll  charges  to  one  third  the  cost 
of  manually  sending  each  message  individually.  Outlying  stations  of  both  the 
Army  and  Navy  picked  out  Japanese  messages  bearing  certain  indicators, 
enciphered  the  Japanese  cryptograms  in  an  American  system,  and  radioed 
them  to  Washington.  The  reencipherment  was  to  keep  the  Japanese  from 
knowing  of  the  extensive  American  cryptanalytic  effort.  Only  the  three  top 
Japanese  systems  were  involved  in  this  expensive  radio  retransmission: 
purple,  red  (a  machine  system  that  antedated  purple,  which  had  supplanted

it  at  major  embassies,  but  that  was  still  in  use  for  legations  such  as  Vladi- 
vostok), and  the  j series  of  enciphered  codes.  The  Army  did  not  install  a 
teletype  for  intercepts  from  its  continental  posts  until  the  afternoon  of 
December  6,  1941;  the  first  messages  (from  San  Francisco)  were  received  in 
the  early  morning  hours  of  December  7. 

The  intercept  services  missed  little.  Of  the  227  messages  pertaining  to 
Japanese- American  negotiations  sent  between  Tokyo  and  Washington  from 
March  to  December,  1941,  all  but  four  were  picked  up. 

In  Honolulu,  where  a large  Japanese  population  produced  nightmares  of 
antlike  espionage  and  potential  sabotage,  the  14th  Naval  District’s  intellig- 
ence officer,  Captain  Irving  S.  Mayfield,  had  long  sought  to  obtain  copies  of 
the  cablegrams  of  Consul  General  Nagao  Kita.  If  Rochefort’s  unit  could  solve 
these,  Mayfield  figured,  he  might  know  better  which  Japanese  to  shadow  and 
what  information  they  sought. 

His  intuitions  were  sound.  On  March  27,  1941,  not  two  weeks  after  May- 
field  himself  took  up  his  duties,  a young  ensign  of  the  Imperial  Japanese  Navy, 
25-year-old  Takeo  Yoshikawa,  who  had  steeped  himself  in  information  about 
the  American  Navy,  arrived  in  Honolulu  to  serve  as  Japan’s  only  military 
espionage  agent  covering  Pearl  Harbor.  Under  the  cover-name  “Tadasi  Mori- 
mura,”  he  was  assigned  to  the  consulate  as  a secretary.  He  promptly  made 
himself  obnoxious — and  drew  suspicion  upon  himself  within  the  consulate 
staff— by  coming  to  work  late  or  not  at  all,  getting  drunk  frequently,  having 
women  in  his  quarters  overnight,  and  even  insulting  the  consul  himself  on 
occasion.  But  he  managed  to  tour  the  islands,  and  within  a month  was 
sending  such  messages  as:  “Warships  observed  at  anchor  on  the  11th  [of 
May,  1941]  in  Pearl  Harbor  were  as  follows:  Battleships,  11 : Colorado,  West 
Virginia,  California,  Tennessee.  . . .”  These  were  sent  in  the  consulate’s 
diplomatic  systems,  not  in  naval  code. 

But  Mayfield’s  hopes  of  peering  into  these  secret  activities  through  the 
window  of  a broken  code  were  stymied  by  the  refusal  of  the  cable  offices  to 
violate  the  statute  against  interception.  His  desires  grew  more  intense  as 
another  source  failed  to  yield  any  information  of  counterespionage  activity. 
For  months  one  of  his  enlisted  men,  Theodore  Emanuel,  had  tapped  half  a 
dozen  of  the  consulate’s  telephone  lines,  recorded  the  50  or  60  calls  made  on 
them  each  day,  and  turned  the  recordings  over  to  Lieutenant  Denzel  Carr  for 
translation  and  summarization.  But  this  eavesdropping  produced  at  best 
some  juicy  items  about  bachelor  Kita’s  sex  life  (such  as  his  chasing  a maid 
around  a bedpost  one  night  after  a sake-soaked  Japanese  wedding);  there  was 
little  to  help  Mayfield. 

So  when  David  Sarnoff,  president  of  the  Radio  Corporation  of  America, 
vacationed  in  Hawaii,  Mayfield  spoke  to  him.  It  was  subsequently  arranged 
that  thenceforth  R.C.A.’s  Japanese  consulate  messages  would  be  quietly  given 
to  the  naval  authorities.  But  the  consulate  rotated  its  business  among  the 


14  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

several  cable  companies  in  Honolulu,  and  R.C.A.’s  turn  was  not  due  until 
December  1. 

In  Washington,  however,  intercepts  overwhelmed  GY  and  S.I.S.  The  tiny 
staff  of  cryptanalysts  simply  could  not  cope  with  all  of  them  expeditiously. 

This  difficulty  was  resolved  in  two  ways. 

One  was  to  cut  out  duplication  of  effort.  At  first,  both  services  solved  all 
their  Japanese  diplomatic  intercepts.  But  beginning  more  than  a year  before 
Pearl  Harbor,  messages  originating  in  Tokyo  on  odd-numbered  days  of  the 
month  were  handled  by  the  Navy,  those  on  even  days,  by  the  Army.  Each 
began  breaking  the  messages  sent  in  from  its  own  intercept  stations  until  it 
reached  the  Tokyo  date  of  origin;  it  would  then  retain  them  or  send  them  over 
as  the  dates  indicated.  The  cryptanalysts  utilized  the  extra  time  to  attack  as- 
yet-unbroken  systems  and  to  clean  up  backlogs. 

The  other  method  was  to  concentrate  on  the  important  intercepts  and  let 
the  others  slide,  at  least  until  the  important  ones  were  completed.  But  how 
can  a cryptanalyst  tell  which  messages  are  important  until  he  has  solved  them? 
He  cannot,  but  he  can  assume  that  messages  sent  in  the  more  secret  systems 
are  the  more  important.  All  dispatches  cannot  be  transmitted  in  a single 
system  because  the  huge  volume  of  traffic  would  enable  cryptanalysts  to 
break  it  too  quickly.  Hence  most  nations  set  up  a hierarchy  of  systems, 
reserving  the  top  ones  for  their  vital  needs. 

Japan  was  no  exception.  Though  her  Foreign  Office  employed  an  almost 
bewildering  variety  of  different  codes,  resorting,  from  time  to  time,  to  the 
Yokohama  Specie  Bank’s  private  code,  a Chinese  ideographic  code  list,  and 
codes  bearing  kata  kana  names,  such  as  ta,  ji,  or  hen,  it  relied  in  the  main  on 
four  systems.  American  cryptanalysts  ranked  these  on  four  levels  according  to 
the  inherent  difficulty  of  their  solution  and  the  messages  that  they  generally 
carried.  Intercepts  were  then  solved  in  the  order  of  this  priority  schedule. 

Simplest  of  all,  and  hence  the  lowest  in  rank  and  last  to  be  read  (excluding 
plain  language),  was  the  la  code,  so  called  from  the  indicator  group  la  that 
preceded  its  codetexts,  la  did  little  more  than  put  kata  kana  into  roman 
letters  for  telegraphic  transmission  and  to  secure  some  abbreviation  for  cable 
economy.  Thus  the  kana  for  ki  was  replaced  by  the  code  form  ci,  the  kana  for 
to  by  if,  the  two-kana  combination  of  ka  + n by  ce.  Its  two-letter  codewords, 
all  of  either  vowel-consonant  or  consonant-vowel  form  and  including  such  as 
zo  for  4,  were  supplemented  by  a list  of  four-letter  codewords,  such  as  tuve 
for  dollars,  sisa  for  ryoji  (“consul”),  and  xygy  for  Yokohama.  A very  typical 
la  message  is  serial  01250  from  the  Foreign  Minister  to  Kita,  dated  December 
4,  which  begins  in  translation:  “The  following  has  been  authorized  as  the 
year-end  bonus  for  employee  typists  of  your  office.’  This  sort  of  code  is 
generally  called  a “passport  code”  because  it  usually  serves  for  messages  cover- 
ing the  administrative  routine  of  a mission,  such  as  issuance  of  passports  and 
visas,  la  was  a particularly  simple  one  to  solve,  partly  because  it  had  been  in 


15 


One  Day  of  Magic 

effect  since  1925,  partly  because  of  the  regularities  in  its  construction.  For 
example,  all  kana  that  ended  in  e had  as  code  equivalents  groups  beginning 
with  A ( ke  = ac,  se  = ad),  and  all  that  began  with  k had  code  equivalents 
beginning  or  ending  with  c.  Identification  of  one  kana  would  thus  suggest  the 
identification  of  others. 

One  rung  up  the  cryptographic  ladder  was  the  system  known  to  the 
Japanese  as  Oite  and  to  American  codebreakers  as  pa-k2.  The  pa  part  was  a 
two-  and  four-letter  code  similar  to  the  la,  though  much  more  extensive  and 
with  codegroups  disarranged.  The  k2  part  was  a transposition  based  on  a 
keynumber.  The  letters  from  the  pa  encoding  were  written  under  this  key- 
number  from  right  to  left  and  then  copied  out  in  mixed  order,  taking  first  the 
letter  under  number  1,  then  the  letter  under  number  2,  until  the  row  was  com- 
pleted. The  process  was  repeated  for  successive  rows. 

For  example,  on  December  4 Yoshikawa  wired  the  Foreign  Minister  that 
“At  1 o’clock  on  the  4th  a light  cruiser  of  the  Honolulu  class  hastily  departed— 
Morimura.”  In  romaji  (the  roman-letter  version  of  the  kata  kana)  this  became 
4th  gogo  1 kei  jun  ( honoruru ) kata  hyaku  shutsu  ko — morimura.  In  pa,  with 
the  parentheses  getting  their  own  codegroups  (oq  and  uq),  it  assumed  this 
form : bydh  dost  je  yo  ia  oq  gu  ra  hy  hy  uq  vi  la  yj  ay  ec  ty  fi  banl,  with 
fi  indicating  use  four-letter  code.  (The  code  clerk  made  two  errors.  After 
encoding  kata  by  vi,  he  encoded  an  extra  la  into  la  and  an  unnecessary  re 
into  ty.)  This  was  then  written  under  the  keynumber  from  right  to  left,  with 
an  extra  letter  i as  a null  to  complete  the  final  five-letter  group :

pa-k2  did  not  pose  much  of  a problem  to  experienced  American  crypt- 
analysts. Rochefort  estimated  that  his  unit  could  crack  a pa-k2  message  in 


16 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


from  six  hours  to  six  days,  with  three  days  a good  average.  The  transposition 
was  vulnerable  because  each  line  was  shuffled  identically;  the  cryptanalyst 
could  slice  a cryptogram  into  groups  of  15  or  17  or  19  and  anagram  these 
simultaneously  until  the  predominant  vowel-consonant  alternation  appeared 
on  all  lines;  the  underlying  code  could  then  be  solved  by  assuming  that  the 
most  frequent  codegroups  represented  the  most  frequent  kana  ( i , followed  by 
ma,  shi,  o,  etc.)  and  filling  out  the  skeleton  words  that  resulted.  Since  the 
system  had  remained  in  use  for  several  years,  this  reconstruction  had  long 
been  accomplished  by  the  Washington  agencies.  Hence  solution  involved 
only  unraveling  any  new  transposition  and,  with  luck,  might  take  only  a 
few  hours.  It  could  also  take  a few  days.  Primarily  because  of  pa-k2’s  deferred 
position  in  the  priority  list,  an  average  of  two  to  four  days  elapsed  between 
interception  and  translation. 

The  code  clerk  in  Honolulu  enveloped  Yoshikawa’s  final  messages  in 
pa-k2  only  because  higher-level  codes  had  been  destroyed  December  2 on 
orders  from  Tokyo.  Normally,  espionage  reports  of  shipping  movements  and 
military  activities,  sent  routinely  by  Japanese  consuls  from  their  posts  all  over 
the  world,  were  framed  on  that  next  level  of  secrecy.  Here  prevailed  a succes- 
sion of  codes  called  tsu  by  the  Japanese  and  the  j series  by  Americans.  These 
were  even  more  extensive  and  more  thoroughly  disarranged  than  pa,  and  they 
were  transposed  by  a system  of  far  greater  complexity  than  the  rather  simple 
and  vulnerable  k2.  Furthermore,  the  code  and  the  transposition  were  changed 
at  frequent  intervals.  Thus  j17-k6  was  replaced  on  March  1 by  j18-k8,  and 
that  in  turn  by  j19-k9  on  August  1. 

The  transposition  was  the  real  stumbling  block.  Like  the  k2,  it  used  a 
keynumber,  but  it  differed  in  being  copied  off  vertically  instead  of  horizont- 
ally, and  in  having  a pattern  of  holes  in  the  transposition  blocks.  These  holes 
were  left  blank  when  the  code  groups  are  inscribed  into  the  block.  For 
example,  letting  the  alphabet  from  a to  Y serve  as  the  code  message:

The  letters  were  transcribed  in  columns  in  the  order  of  the  keynumbers, 
skipping  over  the  blanks:  bjmv  ehkt  nw  cgorx  afilqu  dpsy.  This  would  be 
sent  in  the  usual  five-letter  groups. 

The  first  step  in  solving  a columnar  transposition  like  this,  but  without 
blanks,  is  to  cut  the  cryptogram  into  the  approximately  equal  segments  that

vary  the  length  of  the  column  segments.  The  second  step  is  to  reconstruct  the

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  problems  of  solving  such  a system  are  illustrated  by  the  fact  that 
j18-k8  was  not  broken  until  more  than  a month  after  its  introduction.  The 
cryptanalysts  had  to  make  a fresh  analysis  for  each  pattern  of  blanks  and  each 
transposition  key.  The  key  changed  daily,  the  blank-pattern  three  times  a 
month.  Hence  j19-k9  solutions  were  frequently  delayed.  The  key  and  pattern 
for  November  18  were  not  recovered  until  December  3;  those  for  November 
28,  not  until  December  7.  On  the  other  hand,  solution  was  sometimes 
effected  within  a day  or  two.  Success  usually  depended  on  the  quantity  of 
intercepts  in  a given  key.  About  10  or  15  per  cent  of  j19-k9  keys  were  never 
solved. 

This  situation  contrasts  with  that  of  purple,  the  most  secret  Japanese 
system,  in  which  all  but  2 or  3 per  cent  of  keys  were  recovered  and  in  which 
most  messages  were  solved  within  hours.  Did  the  Japanese  err  in  assessing  the 
security  of  their  systems  ? Yes  and  no.  purple  was  easier  to  keep  up  with  once 
it  was  solved,  but  it  was  a much  more  difficult  system  to  break  in  the  first  place 
than  j19-k9.  The  solution  of  the  purple  machine  was,  in  fact,  the  greatest 
feat  of  cryptanalysis  the  world  had  yet  known. 

The  cipher  machine  that  Americans  knew  as  purple  bore  the  resounding 
official  Japanese  title  of  97-shiki  O-bun  In-ji-ki.  This  meant  Alphabetical 
Typewriter  ’97,  the  ’97  an  abbreviation  for  the  year  2597  of  the  Japanese 
calendar,  which  corresponds  to  1937.  The  Japanese  usually  referred  to  it 
simply  as  “the  machine”  or  as  “J,”*  the  name  given  it  by  the  Imperial  Japanese 
Navy,  which  had  adapted  it  from  the  German  Enigma  cipher  machine  and 
then  had  lent  it  to  the  Foreign  Ministry,  which,  in  turn,  had  further  modified 
it.  Its  operating  parts  were  housed  in  a drawer-sized  box  between  two  big 
black  electrically  operated  Underwood  typewriters,  which  were  connected  to 
it  by  26  wires  plugged  into  a row  of  sockets  called  a plugboard.  To  encipher  a 
message,  the  cipher  clerk  would  consult  the  thick  yu  go  book  of  machine 
keys,  plug  in  the  wire  connections  according  to  the  key  for  the  day,  turn  the 
four  disks  in  the  box  so  the  numbers  on  their  edges  were  those  directed  by 
the  yu  GO,  and  type  out  the  plaintext.  His  machine  would  record  that  plain- 
text while  the  other,  getting  the  electric  impulses  after  the  coding  box  had 
twisted  them  through  devious  paths,  would  print  out  the  ciphertext.  Decipher- 
ing was  the  same,  though  the  machine  irritatingly  printed  the  plaintext  in  the 
five-letter  groups  of  the  ciphertext  input. 

The  Alphabetical  Typewriter  worked  on  roman  letters,  not  kata  kana. 
Hence  it  could  encipher  English  as  well  as  romaji — and  also  roman-letter 
codetexts,  like  those  of  the  j codes.  Since  themachin  e could  not  encipher 
numerals  or  punctuation,  the  code  clerk  first  transformed  them  into  three-letter 
codewords,  given  in  a small  code  list,  and  enciphered  these.  The  receiving  clerk 
would  restore  the  punctuation,  paragraphing,  and  so  on,  when  typing  up  a 
finished  copy  of  the  decode.

One  Day  of  Magic 

The  guts  and  heart  of  the  machine  were  the  plugboards  and  the  coding 
wheels.  They  diverted  the  current  flowing  along  the  connections  from  the 
input  typewriter  to  the  output  one  so  that  when  the  a key  was  depressed  on 
the  input  keyboard  an  a would  not  be  typed  on  the  output  machine.  The 
diversion  began  with  the  plugboard  connections.  If  the  coding  box  were  not 
present,  a plugboard  wire  would  take  the  electric  impulse  from  the  a key  of 
the  plaintext  typewriter  and  bring  it  directly  to,  say,  the  R typebar  of  the 
ciphertext  machine.  Other  wires  would  similarly  connect  the  plaintext  keys  to 
noncorresponding  ciphertext  typebars.  This  would  automatically  produce  a 
cipher,  though  a very  elementary  one.  Each  time  plaintext  a was  depressed 
ciphertext  R would  appear.  So  simple  a system  affords  no  security.  The  plug- 
board connections  can  be  changed  from  message  to  message,  or  even  within 
a message,  but  this  does  not  noticeably  augment  the  system’s  strength. 

Here  is  where  the  four  coding  wheels  came  in.  Interposed  between  the 
plugboard  of  the  plaintext  typewriter  and  that  of  the  ciphertext  machine,  they 
were  shifted  constantly  with  respect  to  one  another  by  their  supporting 
assembly.  The  enciphering  current  had  to  traverse  their  winding  wire  paths  to 
get  from  one  typewriter  to  the  other,  and  the  constant  shifting  continually  set 
up  different  paths.  Thus  impulses  from  a given  plaintext  letter  were  switched 
through  the  box  along  ever  varying  detours  to  emerge  at  ever  differing  cipher- 
text  letters.  Plaintext  a might  be  represented  in  a long  message  by  all  26 
letters.  Conversely,  any  given  ciphertext  letter  might  stand  for  any  one  of 
26  plaintext  letters.  Switches  on  the  coding  wheels  could  be  flicked  one  way  or 
the  other;  this  constituted  part  of  the  key  and  was  done  by  the  code  clerk 
before  enciphering.  Usually  the  plugboard  connections  were  changed  each  day. 

These  factors  united  to  produce  a cipher  of  exceptional  difficulty.  The 
more  a cipher  deviates  from  the  simple  form  in  which  one  ciphertext  letter 
invariably  replaces  the  same  plaintext  letter,  the  harder  it  is  to  break.  A cipher 
might  replace  a given  plaintext  letter  by  five  different  ciphertext  letters  in 
rotation,  for  example.  But  the  Alphabetical  Typewriter  produced  a substitu- 
tion series  hundreds  of  thousands  of  letters  long.  Its  coding  wheels,  stepping 
a space — or  two,  or  three,  or  four — after  every  letter  or  so,  did  not  return  to 
their  original  positions  to  re-create  the  same  series  of  paths,  and  hence  the 
same  sequence  of  substitutes,  until  hundreds  of  thousands  of  letters  had  been 
enciphered.  The  task  of  the  cryptanalysts  consisted  primarily  of  reconstructing 
the  wiring  and  switches  of  the  coding  wheels — a task  made  more  burdensome 
by  the  daily  change  of  plugboard  connections.  Once  this  was  done,  the  crypt- 
analyst still  had  to  determine  the  starting  position  of  the  coding  wheels  for 
each  day’s  messages.  But  this  was  a comparatively  simple  secondary  job. 

American  cryptanalysts  knew  none  of  these  details  when  the  Japanese 
Foreign  Office  installed  the  Alphabetical  Typewriter  in  its  major  embassies  in 
the  late  1930s.  How,  then,  did  they  solve  it?  Where  did  they  begin?  How  did 
they  even  know  that  a new  machine  was  in  service,  since  the  Japanese 
government  did  not  announce  it? 


20 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  purple  machine  supplanted  the  red  machine,*  which  American 
cryptanalysts  had  solved,  and  so  probably  their  first  clue  to  the  new  machine 
was  the  disconcerting  discovery  that  they  could  no  longer  read  the  important 
Japanese  messages.  At  the  same  time,  they  observed  new  indicators  for  the 
purple  system.  Clues  to  the  system’s  nature  came  from  such  characteristics 
of  its  ciphertext  as  the  frequency  of  letters,  the  percentage  of  blanks  (letters 
that  did  not  appear  in  a given  message),  and  the  nature  and  number  of 
repetitions.  Perhaps  the  codebreakers  also  assumed  that  the  new  machine 
comprised  essentially  a more  complicated  and  improved  version  of  the  one  it 
replaced.  In  this  they  were  right. 

Their  first  essays  at  breaking  into  the  cipher  both  accompanied  and  supple- 
mented their  attempts  to  determine  the  type  of  cipher.  Their  previous  success 
with  the  red  machine  and  with  the  lesser  systems  had  given  them  insight  into 
the  Japanese  diplomatic  forms  of  address,  favorite  phrases,  and  style  (para- 
graphs were  often  numbered,  for  example).  These  provided  the  cryptanalysts 
with  probable  words — words  likely  to  be  in  the  plaintext — that  would  help  in 
breaking  the  cipher.  Opening  and  closing  formulas,  such  as  “I  have  the  honor 
to  inform  Your  Excellency”  and  “Re  your  telegram,”  constituted  virtual 
cribs.  Newspaper  stories  suggested  the  subject  matter  of  intercepts.  The  State 
Department  sometimes  made  public  the  full  texts  of  diplomatic  notes  from 
Japan  to  the  American  government,  in  effect  handing  the  cryptanalysts  the 
plaintext  (or  its  translation)  of  an  entire  dispatch.  (State  reportedly  did  not 
pass  the  texts  of  confidential  notes  to  the  cryptanalysts,  though  this  would 
have  helped  them  considerably  and  was  done  by  other  foreign  ministries.) 
Japan’s  Foreign  Office  often  had  to  circulate  the  same  text  to  several  embas- 
sies, not  all  of  which  had  a purple  machine,  and  a code  clerk  might  have 
inadvertently  encoded  some  cables  in  purple,  some  in  other  systems — which 
the  cryptanalysts  could  read.  A comparison  of  times  of  dispatch  and  length, 
and  voilal — another  crib  to  a cryptogram.  Errors  were,  as  always,  a fruitful 
source  of  clues.  As  late  as  November,  1941,  the  Manila  legation  repeated  a 
telegram  “because  of  a mistake  on  the  plugboard.”  How  much  more  common 
must  errors  have  been  when  the  code  clerks  were  just  learning  to  handle  the 
machine!  The  sending  of  the  identical  text  in  two  different  keys  produces 
“isomorphic”  cryptograms  that  yield  exceedingly  valuable  information  on  the 
composition  of  the  cipher. 

The  cryptanalysts  of  S.I.S.  and  op-20-g,  then,  matched  these  assumed 
plaintexts  to  their  ciphertexts  and  looked  for  regularities  from  which  they 

* Whence,  apparently,  its  codename.  In  American  prewar  military  and  naval  parlance, 
the  codeword  orange  meant  Japan  in  official  papers  such  as  war  plans,  and  even  in  personal 
letters  between  high-ranking  officers.  In  the  1930s,  Lieutenant  Jack  S.  Holtwick,  Jr.,  a Navy 
cryptanalyst,  built  a machine  to  solve  a Japanese  diplomatic  cipher  that  was  abandoned 
in  1938.  American  cryptanalysts  could  very  naturally  have  called  it  the  orange  machine. 
As  the  successors  of  this  system  appeared,  each  increasingly  enigmatic,  their  American 
codenames  might  well  have  progressively  deepened  in  hue.

One  Day  of  Magic 

could  derive  a pattern  of  encipherment.  This  kind  of  work,  particularly  in  the 
early  stages  of  a difficult  cryptanalysis,  is  perhaps  the  most  excruciating, 
exasperating,  agonizing  mental  process  known  to  man.  Hour  after  hour,  day 
after  day,  sometimes  month  after  month,  the  cryptanalyst  tortures  his  brain 
to  find  some  relationship  between  the  letters  that  hangs  together,  does  not 
dead-end  in  self-contradiction,  and  leads  to  additional  valid  results.  “Most  of 
the  time  he  is  groping  in  the  darkest  night,”  one  solver  has  written.  “Now  and 
again  a little  flicker  of  light  gleams  across  the  darkness,  tantalizing  him  with  a 
glimpse  of  a path.  Hopefully  he  dashes  to  it  only  to  find  himself  in  another 
labyrinth.  His  knowledge  that  night  is  inevitably  followed  by  day  keeps  his 
waning  courage  up,  and  he  steers  his  course  towards  where  the  morning  sun 
is  soon  to  appear.  Except  that  sometimes  he  is  engulfed  in  an  interminable 
polar  night.” 

It  must  have  seemed  like  that  interminable  night  to  the  cryptanalysts  who 
began  attacking  the  new  Japanese  machine.  The  codebreakers  went  just  so 
far — and  for  months  could  not  push  on  further.  As  William  Friedman  re- 
called, “When  the  purple  system  was  first  introduced  it  presented  an  ex- 
tremely difficult  problem  on  which  the  Chief  Signal  Officer  [Mauborgne]  asked 
us  to  direct  our  best  efforts.  After  work  by  my  associates  when  we  were  mak- 
ing very  slow  progress,  the  Chief  Signal  Officer  asked  me  personally  to  take 
a hand.  I had  been  engaged  largely  in  administrative  duties  up  to  that  time,  so 
at  his  request  I dropped  everything  else  that  I could  and  began  to  work  with 
the  group.” 

Friedman  was  (and  is)  the  world’s  greatest  cryptologist.  Then  in  his  late 
forties,  he  was  a quiet,  studious  man,  well  liked  by  his  associates,  of  average 
height  and  build,  and  a natty  dresser  given  to  bow  ties.  Trained  as  a geneticist, 
he  had  become  interested  in  cryptology  in  1915  at  a research  institution  in 
Illinois  called  the  Riverbank  Laboratories.  He  served  as  a cryptanalyst  with 
the  American  Expeditionary  Forces  in  World  War  I,  and  returned  to  River- 
bank  to  write  an  87-page  tract  that  revolutionized  cryptanalysis  by  introduc- 
ing statistical  methods  for  the  first  time.  Hired  by  the  Signal  Corps  in  1921, 
he  applied  these  methods  to  a cipher-machine  solution  that  placed  America 
in  the  forefront  of  world  cryptology.  During  these  years,  his  wife,  the  former 
Elizebeth  Smith,  whom  he  had  met  and  married  at  Riverbank,  was  solving 
rumrunners’  codes  for  the  Coast  Guard.  He  wrote  textbooks  in  cryptanalysis 
that  are  models  of  clarity.  He  became  head  of  S.I.S.  when  it  was  founded  and 
continued  to  exercise  his  extraordinary  cryptanalytic  abilities.  His  genius  soon 
manifested  itself  in  the  attack  on  purple. 

Lighting  his  way  with  some  of  the  methods  that  he  himself  had  developed, 
he  led  the  cryptanalysts  through  the  murky  purple  shadowland.  He  assigned 
teams  to  test  various  hypotheses.  Some  prospected  fruitlessly,  their  only  result 
a demonstration  that  success  lay  in  another  direction.  Others  found  bits  and 
pieces  that  seemed  to  make  sense,  (op-20-g  cooperated  in  this  work,  with 
Harry  L.  Clark  making  especially  valuable  contributions,  but  S.I.S.  did  most

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


of  it.)  Friedman  and  the  other  codebreakers  began  to  segregate  the  ciphertext 
letters  into  cycles  representing  the  rotation  of  the  coding  wheels — gingerly  at 
first,  then  faster  and  faster  as  the  evidence  accumulated.  The  polyalphabetic 
class  of  ciphers,  to  which  purple  belonged,  is  based  ultimately  upon  an 
alphabet  table,  usually  26  letters  by  26.  To  reconstruct  the  purple  tables,  the 
cryptanalysts  employed  both  direct  and  indirect  symmetry  of  position — 
names  only  slightly  less  forbidding  than  the  methods  they  denote.  Errors, 
caused  perhaps  by  garbled  interceptions  or  simple  mistakes  in  the  crypt- 
analysis, jarred  these  delicate  analyses  and  delayed  the  work.  But  slowly  it 
progressed.  A cryptanalyst,  brooding  sphinxlike  over  the  cross-ruled  paper 
on  his  desk,  would  glimpse  the  skeleton  of  a pattern  in  a few  scattered  letters; 
he  tried  fitting  a fragment  from  another  recovery  into  it;  he  tested  the  new 
values  that  resulted  and  found  that  they  produced  acceptable  plaintext;  he 
incorporated  his  essay  into  the  over-all  solution  and  pressed  on.  Experts  in 
Japanese  filled  in  missing  letters;  mathematicians  tied  in  one  cycle  with  an- 
other and  both  to  the  tables.  Every  weapon  of  cryptanalytic  science — which 
in  the  stratospheric  realm  of  this  solution  drew  heavily  upon  mathematics, 
using  group  theory,  congruences,  Poisson  distributions — was  thrown  into  the 
fray. 

Eventually  the  solution  reached  the  point  where  the  cryptanalysts  had  a 
pretty  good  pencil-and-paper  analog  of  the  purple  machine.  SJ.S.  then 
constructed  a mechanism  that  would  do  automatically  what  the  cryptanalysts 
could  do  manually  with  their  tables  and  cycles.  They  assembled  it  out  of 
ordinary  hardware  and  easily  available  pieces  of  communication  equipment, 
such  as  the  selector  switches  used  for  telephones.  It  was  hardly  a beautiful 
piece  of  machinery,  and  when  not  running  just  right  it  spewed  sparks  and 
made  loud  whirring  noises.  Though  the  Americans  never  saw  the  97-shiki 
O-bun  In-ji-ki,  their  contraption  bore  a surprising  physical  resemblance  to  it, 
and  of  course  exactly  duplicated  it  cryptographically. 

S.I.S.  handed  in  its  first  complete  purple  solution  in  August  of  1940,  after 
18  or  20  months  of  the  most  intensive  analysis.  In  looking  back  on  the  effort 
that  culminated  in  this,  the  outstanding  cryptanalytic  success  in  the  whole 
history  of  secret  writing  up  to  its  time,  Friedman  would  say  generously: 

Naturally  this  was  a collaborative,  cooperative  effort  on  the  part  of  all  the 
people  concerned.  No  one  person  is  responsible  for  the  solution,  nor  is  there  any 
single  person  to  whom  the  major  share  of  credit  should  go.  As  I say,  it  was  a 
team,  and  it  was  only  by  very  closely  coordinated  teamwork  that  we  were  able 
to  solve  it,  which  we  did.  It  represents  an  achievement  of  the  Army  cryptanalytic 
bureau  that,  so  far  as  I know,  has  not  been  duplicated  elsewhere,  because  we 
definitely  know  that  the  British  cryptanalytic  service  and  the  German  crypt- 
analytic service  were  baffled  in  their  attempts  and  they  never  did  solve  it. 

Friedman,  was,  despite  his  partial  disclaimer,  the  captain  of  that  team.  The 
solution  had  taken  a terrific  toll.  The  restless  turning  of  the  mind  tormented 


23 


One  Day  of  Magic 

by  a puzzle,  the  preoccupation  at  meals,  the  insomnia,  the  sudden  wakening 
at  midnight,  the  pressure  to  succeed  because  failure  could  have  national 
consequences,  the  despair  of  the  long  weeks  when  the  problem  seemed 
insoluble,  the  repeated  dashings  of  uplifted  hopes,  the  mental  shocks,  the 
tension  and  the  frustration  and  the  urgency  and  the  secrecy  all  converged  and 
hammered  furiously  upon  his  skull.  He  collapsed  in  December.  After  three 
and  a half  months  in  Walter  Reed  General  Hospital  recovering  from  the 
nervous  breakdown,  he  returned  to  S.I.S.  on  shortened  hours,  working  at 
first  in  the  more  relaxed  area  of  cryptosecurity.  By  the  time  of  Pearl  Harbor 
he  was  again  able  to  do  some  cryptanalysis,  this  time  of  German  systems. 

Meanwhile,  S.I.S.  constructed  a second  purple  machine  and  gave  it  to  the 
Navy.  A third  was  sent  to  England  in  January  of  1941  on  King  George  V, 
Britain’s  newest  and  largest  battleship,  which  had  just  brought  over  her  new 
ambassador  to  the  United  States,  Lord  Halifax.  Two  Army  and  two  Navy 
cryptanalysts  accompanied  the  machine.  In  return  the  United  States  received 
British  cryptanalytic  information,  presumably  about  German  codes  and 
ciphers.  This  machine  eventually  reached  the  British  codebreaking  group  at 
Singapore,  and  was  evacuated  with  it  to  Delhi  after  the  Japanese  swarmed 
down  Malaya.  A fourth  machine  was  sent  to  the  Philippines,  while  a fifth  was 
built  as  an  extra  for  S.I.S.  A machine  for  Hawaii  was  under  construction  at 
the  time  of  Pearl  Harbor;  this  became  instead  a second  machine  sent  to 
England  for  use  there  by  Great  Britain. 

op-20-g  contributed  importantly  to  the  ease  and  speed  of  daily  purple 
solutions  when  27-year-old  Lieutenant  (j.g.)  Francis  A.  Raven  discovered  the 
key  to  the  keys.  After  a number  of  purple  messages  had  been  solved,  Raven 
observed  that  the  daily  keys  within  each  of  the  three  ten-day  periods  of  a 
month  appeared  to  be  related.  He  soon  found  that  the  Japanese  simply 
shuffled  the  first  day’s  key  to  form  the  keys  for  the  next  nine  days,  and  that 
the  nine  shuffling  patterns  were  the  same  in  all  the  ten-day  periods.  Raven’s 
discovery  enabled  the  cryptanalysts  to  predict  the  keys  for  nine  out  of  ten  days. 
The  cryptanalysts  still  had  to  solve  for  the  first  day’s  key  by  straightforward 
analysis,  but  this  task  and  its  delays  were  eliminated  for  the  rest  of  the  period. 
Furthermore,  knowledge  of  the  shuffles  enabled  the  codebreakers  to  read  all 
the  traffic  of  a period  even  though  they  could  solve  only  one  of  the  daily  keys. 

This  fine  piece  of  work,  on  the  shoulders  of  the  tremendous  initial  Fried- 
man-S.I.S.  effort,  resulted  in  the  paradoxical  situation  of  Americans  reading 
the  most  difficult  Japanese  diplomatic  system  more  quickly  and  easily  than 
some  lower-grade  systems.  They  also  became  very  facile  in  reading  two-step 
systems  in  which  purple  superenciphered  an  already  coded  message.  The 
Japanese  did  this  from  time  to  time  to  provide  extra  security,  usually  with  the 
ca  code,  the  personal  code  of  an  ambassador  or  head  of  mission.  A year  after 
S.I.S.  handed  in  its  first  purple  solution,  the  cryptanalysts  solved  a message 
enciphered  in  “the  highest  type  of  secret  classification  used  by  the  Japanese 
Foreign  Office.”  The  message  was  first  enciphered  in  ca;  this  was  then  juggled 


24 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


according  to  the  k9  transposition  (normally  used  with  the  j19  code),  and  the 
transposed  codetext  was  then  enciphered  on  the  purple  machine.  The  solu- 
tion, which  on  the  basis  of  the  number  of  combinations  involved  might  have 
been  expected  to  take  geologic  eons,  was  completed  in  just  four  days. 

The  question  of  who  should  receive  this  hard-won,  easily-lost  information 
was  the  knottiest,  most  nagging,  most  intractable  problem  in  the  whole 
operation  of  magic.  It  involved  a delicate  balancing  of  security  against  utility. 
On  the  one  hand  was  the  need  to  turn  the  results  to  as  much  good  effect  as 
possible,  and  the  more  persons  who  saw  it  the  greater  its  value  would  be.  I 
see  no  use  in  breaking  a cipher,”  one  admiral  remarked  dryly,  “unless  you 
use  its  contents.”  On  the  other  hand  was  the  danger  that  too  wide  a distribu- 
tion would  jeopardize  this  invaluable  intelligence  by  increasing  the  possibility 
of  a leak.  In  general,  policy  leaned  heavily  toward  security,  toward  minimizing 
the  risk  as  much  as  practicable  by  narrowly  restricting  the  number  of  reci- 
pients. 

In  an  agreement  dated  January  23,  1941,  the  intelligence  chiefs  of  the 
Army  and  the  Navy  listed  those  eligible  to  see  magic.  The  ten  named  com- 
prised perhaps  the  most  elite  group  in  the  American  power  structure  of  the 
day:  the  President,  the  secretaries  of  State,  War,  and  Navy,  the  Chief  of 
Staff,  the  Chief  of  Naval  Operations,  the  heads  of  the  Army  and  Navy  War 
Plans  divisions,  and  the  heads  of  the  Army  and  Navy  intelligence  divisions. 
In  practice,  of  course,  many  others  saw  the  intercepts,  such  as  McCollum,  the 
heads  of  the  Army  and  Navy  communications  divisions  (which  controlled  the 
cryptanalytic  bureaus),  and  the  cryptanalysts  and  translators  themselves.  In 
time  so  did  others  not  on  the  original  list  nor  involved  in  the  processing.  By 
December  the  Navy’s  Assistant  Chief  of  Naval  Operations  was  regularly 
reading  magic.  On  the  White  House  staff,  President  Roosevelt’s  right-hand 
man,  Harry  Hopkins,  and  the  President’s  military  and  naval  aides  saw  magic; 
in  fact,  when  Hopkins  was  confined  to  the  Navy  Hospital  in  November  of 
1941,  Kramer  brought  it  over  to  him  specially.  While  Marshall  interpreted  the 
rules  strictly  and  did  not  even  entrust  one  of  his  closest  assistants,  Colonel 
Walter  Bedell  Smith,  secretary  to  the  general  staff,  with  a key  to  the  magic 
briefcase,  other  officials,  like  Hull,  Knox,  and  Stark,  let  their  aides  handle  the 
details  and  so  see  the  intercepts.  In  addition,  at  least  four  subordinate  State 
Department  officers  saw  magic  with  fair  regularity:  Sumner  Welles,  the 
Under  Secretary;  Dr.  Stanley  K.  Hornbeck,  advisor  on  political  relations; 
Maxwell  M.  Hamilton,  chief  of  the  Far  Eastern  desk,  and  Joseph  W.  Ballan- 
tine,  a Far  Eastern  expert. 

Excluded  from  this  tiny  group  were  the  field  commanders  of  major 
military  and  naval  forces.  Security  mainly  controlled,  but  the  feeling  that  this 
high-level,  mainly  political  information  should  be  analyzed  in  Washington 
contributed  to  this  decision.  But  while  the  actual  intercepts— indeed,  the  very 
existence  of  magic— were  kept  from  them,  such  intelligence  extracted  from  it 


25 


One  Day  of  Magic 

as  Washington  thought  would  help  them  was  sent  to  them,  usually  attributed 
to  “highly  reliable  sources.”  For  example,  on  July  8,  Lieutenant  General 
Walter  C.  Short,  commanding  in  Hawaii,  was  told  that  “Movement  of  Jap 
shipping  from  Japan  has  been  suspended  and  additional  merchant  vessels 
are  being  requisitioned.”  This  information  came  from  magic. 

The  Philippines  constituted  a special  case.  Cavite  was  the  Navy’s  most 
favorably  situated  intercept  post  for  Tokyo  radio  traffic,  particularly  Tokyo- 
Berlin,  of  which  Hawaii,  the  East  and  West  coasts,  and  England  combined 
could  not  get  more  than  50  per  cent.  To  cut  the  number  of  retransmissions  of 
intercepts  from  Cavite  to  Washington,  and  thus  reduce  the  danger  of  Japanese 
discovery  of  the  magic  operation,  the  Navy  in  March  sent  out  a purple 
machine  to  the  Philippines,  op-20-gy  radioed  the  daily  purple  and  j19  keys 
to  Fabian’s  unit;  he  applied  these  to  the  messages  intercepted  by  his  and  the 
Army’s  intercept  stations.  He  was  then  to  forward  the  important  solutions  by 
radio.  This  procedure  was  practically  abandoned  later  in  the  year,  when  al- 
most every  purple  message  was  important  and  all  intercepts  bearing  its 
indicator  were  retransmitted  to  Washington.  The  Philippines  were  also  re- 
garded as  the  most  threatened  American  outpost,  and  since  diplomatic 
magic  was  available  right  there  because  of  a geographical  accident,  it  went 
to  General  Douglas  MacArthur  and  to  Admiral  Thomas  C.  Hart. 

In  sending  the  magic  keys  to  Fabian,  op-20-gy  employed  a restricted 
cipher.  Had  the  messages  been  sent  using  the  general  Navy  keys,  any  of  the 
many  ships  and  shore  installations  holding  those  keys  could  have  read  them. 
Worse,  had  the  Japanese  worked  an  Oriental  magic  of  their  own  on  these 
general  keys,  they  would  have  learned  of  America’s  most  precious  secret.  The 
most  secure  naval  cryptosystem  was  the  E.C.M.,  or  Electric  Coding  Machine, 
a device  similar  to  but  much  stronger  than  purple,  which  used  a kind  of  code- 
wheel called  a rotor.  The  magic  cipher  used  the  E.C.M.  with  a special  set  of 
rotors,  resulting,  in  effect,  in  a new  cipher.  Traffic  in  this  cryptochannel,  called 
copek,  was  kept  down,  and  extra  precautions  were  taken  to  guard  against 
occurrences  that  might  aid  cryptanalysis.  Only  officers  of  the  radio  intelligence 
organizations  in  Washington,  Cavite,  and  Honolulu  held  the  rotors.  They 
also  used  copek  to  exchange  information  on  Japanese  naval  codes  that  they 
were  solving. 

Rochefort  in  Hawaii  could  read  the  copek  messages  sending  diplomatic- 
code  keys  to  Fabian,  and  it  may  have  been  from  him  that  Lieutenant  Comman- 
der Edwin  T.  Layton,  intelligence  officer  for  the  Pacific  Fleet,  learned  that  the 
Asiatic  Fleet  had  the  diplomatic  magic.  On  March  11,  1941,  he  asked  Mc- 
Collum to  send  it  out  to  him.  The  head  of  the  Far  Eastern  branch  of  naval 
intelligence  declined,  expounding  what  might  be  called  the  official  line.  On 
April  22  he  wrote: 

I thoroughly  appreciate  that  you  would  probably  be  much  helped  in  your 

daily  estimates  if  you  had  at  your  disposal  the  DIP.  This,  however,  brings  up 


26 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


matters  of  security,  et  cetera,  which  would  be  very  difficult  to  solve.  ...  It  seems 
reasonable  to  suppose  that  the  Department  should  be  the  origin  for  evaluated 
political  situations,  as  its  availability  of  information  is  greater  than  that  of  any 
command  afloat,  however  large,  its  staff  is  larger  and  it  should  be  in  a position 
to  evaluate  the  political  consequences.  ...  I should  think  that  the  forces  afloat 
should,  in  general,  confine  themselves  to  the  estimate  of  the  strategic  and 
tactical  situations  with  which  they  will  be  confronted  when  the  time  of  action 
arrives.  The  material  you  mentioned  can  necessarily  have  but  passing  and 
transient  interest  as  action  in  the  political  sphere  is  determined  by  the  Govern- 
ment as  a whole  and  not  by  the  forces  afloat In  other  words,  while  you  and 

the  Fleet  may  be  highly  interested  in  politics,  there  is  nothing  that  you  can  do 
about  it. 

The  inconsistency  of  this  position  reflects  Washington  s more  basic 
inconsistency  of,  on  the  one  hand,  trying  to  keep  magic  from  the  field  com- 
manders for  security  reasons  and,  on  the  other,  constructing  purple  machines 
for  them. 

Nevertheless,  despite  Washington’s  determination  not  to  send  magic  to 
the  field,  not  to  use  the  ordinary  Navy  cipher  for  it,  and  never  to  identify  it  as 
such  in  dispatches,  the  Navy  in  July  wired  Admiral  Husband  E.  Kimmel, 
commanding  the  Pacific  Fleet,  a whole  series  of  messages  that  gave  the  very 
serial  numbers  of  the  Japanese  diplomatic  messages  in  summarizing  their 
contents!  And  on  July  19,  Washington  began  a message  “purple  14  July 
Canton  to  Tokyo”  and  continued  with  a quote  from  it.  This  practice  ceased 
in  August,  suggesting  tightened  security,  but  again  on  December  3 the  Navy 
clearly  indicated  Japanese  intercepts  as  the  source  of  its  information. 

The  tightening  may  have  resulted  from  several  scares  that  Washington  had 
just  had.  In  March,  State  lost  magic  memorandum  No.  9.  A horrified  Army 
intelligence  officer  once  found  another  magic  memorandum  casually  dis- 
carded in  the  wastebasket  of  Brigadier  General  Edwin  M.  (Pa)  Watson,  the 
President’s  military  aide.  In  Boston  the  F.B.I.  picked  up  a man  connected 
with  the  cryptanalytic  work  who  was  attempting  to  sell  information  on  it.  The 
worst  frights  of  all  came  in  the  spring  of  1941. 

On  the  afternoon  of  April  28,  Hans  Thomsen,  counselor  of  the  German 
embassy  in  Washington,  cabled  his  Foreign  Ministry,  in  a message  not  read  by 
the  U.S.:  “As  communicated  to  me  by  an  absolutely  reliable  source,  the 
State  Department  is  in  possession  of  the  key  to  the  Japanese  coding  system 
and  is  therefore  also  able  to  decipher  telegrams  from  Tokyo  to  Ambassador 
Nomura  here  regarding  Ambassador  Oshima’s  reports  from  Berlin.  After 
thinking  about  it  for  a few  days,  Berlin  gave  this  information  to  its  Axis  ally 
through  Baron  Hiroshi  Oshima,  the  Japanese  ambassador  to  Germany.  He 
passed  it  to  Tokyo  on  May  3 in  a cable  saying  he  believed  it,  and  Tokyo,  on 
May  5,  asked  Washington  “whether  you  have  any  suspicion”  of  the  matter. 
The  American  codebreakers,  who  had  been  following  the  Japanese  messages 
from  Berlin  to  Tokyo  to  Washington,  held  their  breath.  They  remembered 


27 


One  Day  of  Magic 

how  Japan  had  canceled  her  j 12  code  in  1940  on  her  first  inkling  that  the 
British  and  Dutch  were  reading  it.  But  Nomura’s  reply — “The  most  stringent 
precautions  are  taken  by  all  custodians  of  codes  and  ciphers” — evidently 
soothed  the  Foreign  Office,  for  it  contented  itself  with  issuing  stricter  regula- 
tions for  coding. 

Then,  on  May  20,  Nomura  told  Tokyo:  “Though  I do  not  know  which 
ones,  I have  discovered  the  United  States  is  reading  some  of  our  codes.”  The 
cryptanalysts  shuddered.  Would  they  have  to  start  all  over  again?  Nothing 
happened  at  once,  but  a few  days  later  an  incident  made  it  appear  that  only 
the  shipment  of  new  systems  from  Japan  was  delaying  the  change  of  codes. 
On  May  30,  Japan  prohibited  her  merchant  vessels  all  over  the  world  from 
further  use  of  Code  s.  More  to  the  point,  she  did  so  less  than  24  hours  after 
she  learned  that  U.S.  narcotics  agents  had  removed  codes  from  the  tanker 
Nichi  Shin  Maru  near  San  Francisco  during  a search. 

The  dreaded  change  of  code,  which  would  have  cost  the  United  States  her 
best  source  of  information  just  as  it  was  needed  more  and  more,  now  seemed 
inevitable.  But  morning  after  morning,  the  messages  bore  the  same  aspect  and 
continued  to  break  down  under  the  same  treatment.  After  days  of  anxious 
waiting,  Navy  cryptanalysts  read  a cable  from  Tokyo  to  Mexico  on  June  23, 
warning  the  legation:  “There  are  also  some  suspicions  that  they  [the  Ameri- 
cans] read  some  of  our  codes.  Therefore,  we  wish  to  exercise  the  utmost 
caution  in  accomplishing  this  mission.” 

Was  this  to  be  the  extent  of  the  Japanese  security  precautions?  It  seemed 
incredible,  yet  it  appeared  so.  The  cryptosystems  continued  unchanged.  The 
Foreign  Office  capped  its  ludicrous  cryptosecurity  program  of  pointless 
warnings  and  regulation  changes  with  a step  that  was  almost  as  effective  as 
the  others:  on  November  25,  it  directed  its  embassies  to  print  “Kokka 
Kimitsu”  (“State  Secret”)  in  red  enamel  on  the  right  of  the  number  plate  of 
their  cipher  machines.  Perhaps  they  thought  that  this  incantation  would 
prevent  cryptanalysis  as  an  amulet  was  supposed  to  ward  off  sickness ! 

But  if  the  Foreign  Office  discredited  the  rumors  of  solution  (because,  in  its 
natural  pride,  it  could  not  imagine  its  codes  being  anything  but  impregnable), 
the  American  recipients  of  magic  knew  that  they  were  all  too  true.  In  1939,  the 
director  of  naval  intelligence  had  personally  brought  magic  in  a looseleaf 
folder  to  a recipient,  waited  there  while  he  read  it,  then  took  the  folder  on  to 
the  next  recipient.  The  increasing  volume  of  magic  had  slowly  eaten  away  at 
this  original  iron  security.  Colonel  Rufus  S.  Bratton,  chief  of  the  Far  Eastern 
section  of  Army  intelligence,  found  himself  wasting  so  much  time  chaperoning 
his  single  copy  that  he  began  to  have  duplicates  and  triplicates  made.  The 
number  of  copies  grew  from  4 in  early  1941  to  14  by  December.  Subordinates 
assumed  the  time-consuming  messenger  function.  Kramer  took  over  for  the 
Navy.  Bratton,  who  had  a higher  rank  and  more  responsibilities  than  Kramer 
(his  opposite  number  was  Kramer’s  superior,  McCollum),  had  to  delegate 
some  of  this  work  still  further.  Three  assistants  in  the  Japan  subsection  of 


28 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


his  Far  Eastern  section,  Lieutenant  Colonel  Carlisle  C.  Dusenbury,  Major 
Wallace  H.  Moore,  and  Second  Lieutenant  J.  Bayard  Schindel,  made  some  of 
his  rounds  for  him.  Instead  of  carrying  around  a single  folder,  copies  were  left 
with  the  recipient. 

Marshall  saw  danger  in  all  this:  “I  intervened  very  directly  and  required 
that  it  [magic]  be  locked  in  a pouch  and  delivered  by  pouch,  the  pouch  un- 
locked and  it  be  read  by  the  recipient  and  put  back  in  the  pouch.”  The 
“pouches”  were  actually  zippered  briefcases  made  by  the  Washington  leather 
shop  of  Becker  & Co.  Each  had  a padlock  to  which  there  were  only  two  keys, 
one  held  by  the  disseminator,  one  by  the  recipient,  either  personally  or  by  his 
aide.  This  crackdown — about  September — compelled  the  executive  officer  of 
the  military  intelligence  division,  who  had  been  seeing  magic  while  his  chief 
was  on  leave,  to  surrender  his  key  and  to  stop  reading  the  intercepts.  The 
Navy  soon  adopted  the  Marshall  precautions.  Kramer,  for  example,  often 
sat  next  to  the  recipient  and  explained  references,  furnished  background, 
answered  questions,  and  so  forth — which  is  why  so  valuable  an  officer  was 
given  the  apparently  menial  messenger  task.  Nevertheless,  departures  from 
this  ideal  occurred.  The  messenger  could  not  very  well  stand  over  the  Secretary 
of  War  or  the  Chief  of  Naval  Operations  while  the  messages  were  being  read. 
In  the  State  Department,  the  pouch  was  actually  left  overnight  and  exchanged 
the  next  day  for  a new  one. 

Still,  the  documents  circulated  in  a cloud  of  mystery  and  continuous  pre- 
caution. When  Kramer  telephoned  in  advance  to  recipients  to  find  out  where 
they  were  before  delivering  the  intercepts,  he  would  say  only  guarded  words 
like,  “I  have  something  important  that  you  should  see.”  Bratton’s  immediate 
superior  frequently  saw  him  “leave  his  office  with  several  parcels  under  his 
arm  and  be  gone  for  several  hours,”  and,  because  he  knew  that  his  superior 
wanted  it  that  way,  never  asked  about  it.  He  also  received  packages  from 
S.I.S.  chief  Minckler  when  Bratton  was  out;  these  he  locked  up  in  his  safe 
and  turned  over  to  Bratton  on  his  return  without  having  looked  into  them. 
Before  magic  was  given  to  State,  Army  and  Navy  officers  met  with  Hull  to 
explain  how  a loose  word  could  suddenly  extinguish  the  light  shed  by  these 
intercepts.  When  Knox  received  the  documents  at  his  apartment,  he  did  not 
explain  them  to  his  wife.  At  high-level  conferences,  recipients  took  care  not 
to  mention  magic  when  men  not  privy  to  the  secret  attended.  All  copies  had 
to  be  returned.  No  recipient  could  retain  them  for  reference,  though  back 
copies  were  sometimes  included  in  new  folders  when  later  messages  referred 
to  them.  The  cryptanalytic  agencies  each  filed  two  copies,  one  by  date,  one 
by  subject,  and  the  Far  Eastern  sections  of  Army  and  Navy  intelligence  each 
kept  one.  All  other  copies  were  burned. 

Before  an  intercept  could  even  begin  the  rounds  that  would  end  in  this 
fiery  immolation,  it  ordinarily  had  to  be  translated,  and  translation  was  the 
bottleneck  of  the  magic  production  line.  Interpreters  of  Japanese  were  even 


29 


One  Day  of  Magic 

scarcer  than  expert  cryptanalysts.  Security  precluded  employing  Nisei  or  any 
but  the  most  trustworthy  Americans.  The  Navy  scoured  the  country  for 
acceptable  translators,  and  through  prodigious  efforts  in  1941  it  doubled 
its  gz  translation  staff — to  six.  These  included  three  whom  Kramer  called 
“the  most  highly  skilled  Occidentals  in  the  Japanese  language  in  the 
world.” 

But  ability  in  standard  Japanese  alone  did  not  suffice.  Each  translator  had 
to  have  at  least  a year’s  experience  in  telegraphic  Japanese  as  well  before  he 
could  be  trusted  to  come  through  with  the  correct  interpretation  of  a dispatch. 
This  is  because  telegraphic  Japanese  is  virtually  a language  within  a language, 
and,  as  McCollum,  himself  a Japanese-language  officer,  explained,  “the  so- 
called  translator  in  this  type  of  stuff  almost  has  to  be  a cryptographer  himself. 
You  understand  that  these  things  come  out  in  the  form  of  syllables,  and  it 
is  how  you  group  your  syllables  that  you  make  your  words.  There  is  no 
punctuation. 

“Now,  without  the  Chinese  ideograph  to  read  from,  it  is  most  difficult  to 
group  these  things  together.  That  is,  any  two  sounds  grouped  together  to 
make  a word  may  mean  a variety  of  things.  For  instance,  ‘ba’  may  mean 
horses  or  fields,  old  women,  or  my  hand,  all  depending  on  the  ideographs 
with  which  it  is  written.  On  the  so-called  translator  is  forced  the  job  of  taking 
unrelated  syllables  and  grouping  them  into  what  looks  to  him  to  be  intelligible 
words,  substituting  then  such  of  the  Chinese  ideographs  necessary  to  pin  it 
down,  and  then  going  ahead  with  the  translation,  which  is  a much  more 
difficult  job  than  simple  translation.” 

Hence  the  situation  of  Mrs.  Dorothy  Edgers.  She  had  lived  for  thirty  years 
in  Japan  and  had  a diploma  from  a Japanese  school  to  teach  Japanese  to 
Japanese  students  up  to  high-school  level.  Yet,  because  she  had  only  two 
weeks’  experience  in  gz  at  the  time  of  Pearl  Harbor,  Kramer  considered  her 
“not  a reliable  translator”  in  this  field.  And  on  the  important  messages,  only 
reliable  translators  could  be  used.  To  unclog  this  bottleneck,  messages  in  the 
minor  systems  were  given  only  a partial  translation.  If  a translator  saw  that 
they  dealt  with  administrative  trivia,  they  were  frequently  not  formally 
translated  at  all. 

With  manifold  streamlinings  like  that,  with  enlarged  'staffs,  with  the 
fluidity  gained  by  experience,  op-20-g  and  S.I.S.  gradually  increased  the  speed 
and  quantity  of  their  output.  In  1939,  the  agencies  had  often  required  three 
weeks  to  funnel  a message  from  interceptor  to  recipient.  In  the  latter  part  of 
1941  the  process  sometimes  took  as  little  as  four  hours.  Occasionally  an 
agency  broke  down  a late  intercept  that  bore  on  a point  of  Japanese-American 
negotiations  and  rushed  it  to  the  Secretary  of  State  an  hour  before  he  was  to 
meet  with  the  Japanese  ambassadors.  Volume  attained  overwhelming  pro- 
portions. By  the  fall  of  1941,  50  to  75  messages  a day  sluiced  out  of  the  two 
agencies,  and  at  least  once  the  quantity  swelled  to  130.  Some  of  these  messages 
ran  to  15  typewritten  pages. 


30 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  top-echelon  recipients  of  magic  clearly  could  not  afford  the  time  to 
read  all  this  traffic.  Much  of  it  was  of  secondary  importance  anyway.  Kramer 
and  Bratton  winnowed  the  wheat  from  this  chaff.  Reading  the  entire  output, 
they  chose  an  average  of  25  messages  a day  for  distribution.  At  first  Kramer 
supplemented  his  translations  with  gists  for  recipients  too  busy  to  read  every 
word  of  the  actual  intercepts,  starring  the  important  ones,  but  he  abandoned 
these  in  mid-November  under  the  pressure  of  getting  out  the  basic  material. 
Bratton,  who  had  been  delivering  summaries  of  magic  in  the  form  of  Intellig- 
ence Bulletins,  began  on  August  5 to  distribute  magic  verbatim  at  Marshall  s 
orders.  This,  however,  had  the  effect  of  increasing  the  volume.  Marshall 
complained  that  to  absorb  every  word  of  it  he  would  have  had  to  “retire  as 
Chief  of  Staff  and  read  every  day.”  To  save  the  recipients’  time,  Bratton 
checked  the  important  messages  on  a list  in  the  folder  with  a red  pencil; 
Kramer  slid  paper  clips  onto  them.  The  recipients  always  read  the  flagged 
messages ; the  others  they  did  not  always  read  thoroughly,  but  they  did  leaf 
through  the  folder  and  skim  them. 

Distribution  was  usually  made  twice  a day.  Intercepts  that  had  come  in 
overnight  went  out  in  the  morning,  those  processed  during  the  day  went  out 
at  the  end  of  the  afternoon.  Especially  important  messages  were  delivered  at 
once,  often  to  the  recipients’  homes  if  late  in  the  evening.  Each  agency  sent  its 
magic  copies  on  to  the  other  with  exemplary  promptitude,  despite  a natural 
competition  between  them.  As  Bratton  put  it:  “I  was  further  urged  on  by  the 
fact  that  if  the  Chief  of  Naval  Operations  ever  got  one  of  these  things  before 
General  Marshall  did  and  called  him  up  to  discuss  it  on  the  telephone  with 
him,  and  the  General  hadn’t  gotten  his  copy,  we  all  caught  hell.”  (Marshall 
demurred:  “I  don’t  think  I gave  anybody  hell  much.”) 

Delivery  to  the  White  House  and  the  State  Department  incurred  difficulties. 
Under  the  January  23  agreement,  the  Army  and  Navy  at  first  alternated  in 
servicing  the  two.  The  Army,  however,  discontinued  its  deliveries  to  the  White 
House  after  its  turn  in  May,  partly  because  of  Watson’s  wastebasket  security 
bungle,  partly  because  it  felt  that  these  diplomatic  matters  should  go  to  the 
President  through  the  State  Department.  The  Navy  continued  its  deliveries 
through  the  President’s  naval  aide,  Captain  John  R.  Beardall,  though  once  in 
the  summer  Kramer  himself  carried  a particularly  "hot"  message — probably 
dealing  with  negotiations  the  next  day — to  Roosevelt.  Near  the  end  of 
September,  a month  originally  scheduled  for  Army  delivery,  during  which 
nothing  was  delivered  to  the  White  House,  the  President  said  he  wanted  to  see 
the  intercept  information.  In  October  naval  intelligence  sent  him  memoranda 
based  on  magic,  but  on  Friday,  November  7,  Roosevelt  said  he  wanted  to  see 
magic  itself.  Beardall  told  him  that  it  was  an  Army  month.  The  President 
replied  that  he  knew  that  and  that  he  was  either  seeing  magic  or  getting 
information  on  it  from  Hull,  but  that  he  still  wanted  to  see  the  original 
intercepts.  He  feared  that  condensing  them  would  distort  their  meaning.  On 
Monday,  a conference  agreed  that  the  Navy  would  furnish  the  White  House 


31 


One  Day  of  Magic 

with  magic  and  the  Army  the  State  Department.  At  4: 15  p.m.,  Wednesday, 
November  12,  Kramer  made  the  first  distribution  to  the  White  House  under 
this  system. 

Thus,  by  the  fall  of  1941,  magic  was  being  demanded  at  the  topmost  level 
of  government.  It  had  become  a regular  and  vital  factor  in  the  formation  of 
American  policy.  Hull,  who  looked  upon  magic  “as  I would  a witness  who  is 
giving  evidence  against  his  own  side  of  the  case,”  was  “at  all  times  intensely 
interested  in  the  contents  of  the  intercepts.”  The  chief  of  Army  intelligence 
regarded  magic  as  the  most  reliable  and  authentic  information  that  the  War 
Department  was  receiving  on  Japanese  intentions  and  activities.  The  Navy 
war  plans  chief  thought  that  magic,  which  was  largely  diplomatic  at  this  time, 
affected  his  estimates  by  about  15  per  cent.  The  high  officials  not  only  read 
magic  avidly  and  discussed  it  at  their  conferences,  they  acted  upon  it.  Thus 
the  decision  to  set  up  the  command  of  United  States  Army  Forces,  Far  East, 
which  was  headed  by  General  MacArthur,  stemmed  directly  from  intercepts 
early  in  1941  showing  that  Germany  was  pressuring  Japan  to  attack  Britain 
in  Asia  in  the  hope  of  involving  the  United  States  in  the  war;  on  the  basis  of 
this  information,  the  command  was  created  in  July  to  deter  Japan  by  enhanc- 
ing American  prestige  in  the  Western  Pacific — and  it  is  a fact  that  Japan  did 
not  then  comply  with  Germany’s  wishes. 

The  intricate  mechanism  of  the  American  cryptanalytic  effort  pumped 
magic  to  its  eager  recipients  smoothly,  speedily,  and  lavishly.  Messages  flew 
back  and  forth  along  the  copek  channel  as  if  along  nerve  cells.  Intercepts 
poured  into  Washington  with  less  and  less  of  a time  lag.  S.I.S.  and  gy  grew 
increasingly  adept  at  solution;  the  translators  picked  out  the  important 
messages  ever  more  surely.  Bratton  and  Kramer  hustled  from  place  to  place 
with  their  locked  briefcases,  magic  gushed  forth  in  profusion.  So  effectively 
did  the  cryptanalytic  agencies  perform  that  Marshall  could  say  of  this  “price- 
less asset,”  this  most  complete  and  up-to-the-minute  intelligence  that  any 
nation  had  ever  had  concerning  a probable  enemy,  this  necromantic  gift  of  the 
gods  of  which  one  could  apparently  never  have  enough,  that  “There  was  too 
much  of  it.” 

In  October  the  cabinet  of  Prince  Konoye  fell,  and  the  Emperor  summoned 
General  Hideki  Tojo  to  form  a new  government.  One  of  the  first  acts  of  the 
new  Foreign  Minister,  Shigenori  Togo,  was  to  call  in  the  chief  of  the  cable 
section.  Togo,  remembering  a book  that  Herbert  O.  Yardley  had  written 
disclosing  his  1920  solution  of  Japanese  diplomatic  codes,  asked  the  cable 
chief,  Kazuji  Kameyama,  whether  their  current  diplomatic  communications 
were  secure.  Kameyama  reassured  him.  “This  time,”  he  said,  “it’s  all  right.” 

With  the  assumption  of  total  power  by  the  militarists  under  Tojo,  the  last 
real  hopes  for  peace  died.  Almost  at  once,  events  began  to  slide  toward  war. 
On  November  4,  Tokyo  sent  to  her  ambassadors  at  Washington  the  text  of

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


her  proposal  b,  which  Togo  described  as  “absolutely  final.”  The  ambassadors 
held  it  while  they  pursued  other  avenues,  even  though  Tokyo,  on  November  5, 
told  them  that  “Because  of  various  circumstances,  it  is  absolutely  necessary 
that  all  arrangements  for  the  signing  of  this  agreement  be  completed  by  the 
25th  of  this  month.” 

That  same  day,  Yamamoto  promulgated  Combined  Fleet  Top  Secret 
Order  Number  1,  the  plan  for  the  Pearl  Harbor  attack.  Two  days  later,  he  set 
December  8 (Tokyo  time)  as  Y-day  and  named  Vice  Admiral  Chuichi  Nagumo 
as  Commander,  First  Air  Fleet — the  Pearl  Harbor  strike  force.  In  the  days 
that  followed,  the  32  ships  that  were  to  compose  the  force  slipped,  one  by  one, 
out  to  sea  and  vanished.  Far  from  any  observation,  they  headed  north  to 
rendezvous  in  a bay  of  barren  Etoforu  Island,  one  of  the  chill,  desolate  Kuriles 
north  of  the  four  main  islands  of  Japan.  Behind  them  the  ships  left  their 
regular  wireless  operators  to  carry  on  an  apparently  routine  radio  traffic  in 
their  own  “fists,”  or  sending  touch,  which  is  as  distinctive  as  handwriting. 

As  the  force  was  gathering,  the  Foreign  Office,  which  knew  only  that  the 
situation  was  tense  and  was  never  told  in  advance  of  the  time,  place,  or 
nature  of  the  planned  attack,  prepared  an  open-code  arrangement  as  an 
emergency  means  of  notification.  Tokyo  sent  Circular  2353  to  Washington 
on  November  19: 

Regarding  the  broadcast  of  a special  message  in  an  emergency. 

In  case  of  emergency  (danger  of  cutting  off  our  diplomatic  relations),  and  the 
cutting  off  of  international  communications,  the  following  warning  will  be  added 
in  the  middle  of  the  daily  Japanese  language  short-wave  news  broadcast : 

1)  In  case  of  Japan-U.S.  relations  in  danger:  higashi  no  kaze  ame  (“east 
wind  rain”) 

2)  Japan-U.S. S.R.  relations:  kita  no  kaze  kumori  (“north  wind  cloudy”) 

3)  Japan-British  relations:  nishi  no  kaze  hare  (“west  wind  clear”) 

This  signal  will  be  given  in  the  middle  and  at  the  end  as  a weather  forecast 
and  each  sentence  will  be  repeated  twice.  When  this  is  heard  please  destroy  all 
code  papers,  etc.  This  is  as  yet  to  be  a completely  secret  arrangement.  , 

Forward  as  urgent  intelligence. 

This  open  code  related  the  winds  to  the  compass  points  in  which  the  named 
countries  stood  in  regard  to  Japan:  the  U.S.  to  the  east,  Russia  to  the  north, 
England  to  the  west.  Tokyo  also  set  up  an  almost  similar  code  for  use  in  the 
general  intelligence  (not  news)  broadcasts. 

As  the  secret  messages  establishing  these  open  codes  whistled  through  the 
air.  Navy  intercept  Station  S at  Bainbridge  Island  heard  and  nabbed  them. 
The  station  teletyped  them  to  gy,  which  identified  them  as  J 1 9 and  began 
cryptanalysis. 

Many  of  the  ships  of  the  Pearl  Harbor  strike  force  had  by  then  gathered  in 
bleak  Tankan  Bay,  where  the  only  signs  of  human  presence  were  a small 
concrete  pier,  a wireless  shack,  and  three  fishermen’s  huts.  Snow  covered  the 
surrounding  hills.  In  the  gray  twilight  of  November  21,  the  great  carrier 


One  Day  of  Magic  33 

Zuikaku  glided  into  the  remote  harbor  to  complete  the  roster.  The  force 
swung  at  anchor,  awaiting  the  order  to  sortie. 

A few  hours  later,  on  November  20  (Washington  time),  the  Japanese 
ambassador  to  the  United  States,  Admiral  Kichisaburo  Nomura,  and  his 
newly  arrived  associate,  Saburo  Kurusu,  presented  Japan’s  ultimatum  to  Hull. 
It  would  have  required  the  United  States  to  reverse  its  foreign  policy,  acquiesce 
in  further  Japanese  conquests,  supply  Japan  with  as  much  oil  as  she  required 
for  them,  abandon  China,  and  in  effect  surrender  to  international  immorality. 
While  Hull  began  drafting  a reply,  Tokyo  cabled  its  ambassadors  in  message 
812  that  “There  are  reasons  beyond  your  ability  to  guess  why  we  wanted  to 
settle  Japanese-American  relations  by  the  25th,  but  if  within  the  next  three  or 
four  days  you  can  finish  your  conversations  with  the  Americans;  if  the  signing 
can  be  completed  by  the  29th  (let  me  write  it  out  for  you — twenty-ninth);  if 
the  pertinent  notes  can  be  exchanged;  if  we  can  get  an  understanding  with 
Great  Britain  and  the  Netherlands;  and  in  short  if  everything  can  be  finished, 
we  have  decided  to  wait  until  that  date.  This  time  we  mean  it,  the  deadline 
absolutely  cannot  be  changed.  After  that  things  are  automatically  going  to 
happen.”  Two  days  later,  Togo  wirelessed:  “The  time  limit  set  in  my  message 
No.  812  is  in  Tokyo  time.” 

The  calendar  had  become  a clock,  and  the  clock  had  begun  to  tick. 

On  November  25,  Yamamoto  ordered  the  Pearl  Harbor  strike  force  to 
sortie  next  day.  At  6 a.m.  on  November  26,  the  32  ships  of  the  force — six 
carriers,  two  battleships,  and  a flock  of  destroyers  and  support  vessels — 
weighed  anchor  and  sliced  across  the  wrinkled  surface  of  Tankan  Bay.  They 
steamed  slightly  south  of  east,  heading  into  the  “vacant  sea” — the  wintry 
North  Pacific,  whose  wastes  were  undefiled  by  merchant  tracks  and  whose 
empty  vastness  would  swallow  up  the  force.  They  had  been  ordered  to  return 
if  detected  before  December  6 (Tokyo  time);  if  discovered  on  December  7, 
Nagumo  would  decide  whether  or  not  to  attack.  Strict  radio  silence  was 
enjoined.  Aboard  the  battleship  Hiei,  Commander  Kazuyoshi  Kochi,  a com- 
munications officer  for  the  force,  removed  an  essential  part  of  his  transmitter 
and  put  it  in  a wooden  box,  which  he  used  as  a pillow.  The  force  drove  east- 
ward through  fog,  gale  winds,  and  high  seas.  No  one  saw  them. 

Meanwhile,  Hull,  after  a frantic  week  of  drafting,  consultations,  and  re- 
draftings, had  completed  the  American  reply  to  Japan’s  proposal.  It  called 
upon  Japan  to  withdraw  all  forces  from  China  and  Indochina  and  in  return 
promised  to  unfreeze  Japanese  funds  and  resume  trade.  Nothing  was  said 
about  oil.  On  November  26,  the  day  that  he  handed  it  to  Nomura  and  Kurusu, 
a message  came  from  Tokyo  setting  up  an  open  code  for  them  for  telephone 
use  to  speed  up  their  reports.  In  it,  the  President  was  miss  kimiko,  Hull  was 
miss  fumeko,  Japanese-American  negotiations  were  to  be  referred  to  as  a 
marriage  proposal,  the  criticality  of  the  situation  as  the  imminence  of  the

birth  of  a child,  the  China  question  as  san  Francisco,  and  so  on.  They  had 
occasion  to  use  it  the  very  next  night  to  report  on  an  interview  with  Hull. 
Kurusu  talked  for  seven  minutes,  starting  at  11:27  p.m.  Washington  time, 
with  Kumaicho  Yamamoto,  the  chief  of  the  American  bureau  of  the  Japanese 
Foreign  Office.*  American  interceptors  had  their  recording  machine  running 
even  before  the  Japanese  started  theirs,  and  succeeded  in  capturing  even 
this  rare  form  of  communication.  Kramer  translated  the  conversation,  inter- 
preted the  rather  amateurish  application  of  the  open  code  (even  detecting  an 
attempt  to  bolster  it  with  some  extraneous  comments),  added  the  colorful 
description  of  vocal  nuances  and  pauses,  and  distributed  it  with  the  routine 
magic  intercepts  the  following  day.

The  same  day  that  this  conversation  was  held,  Tokyo  circularized  its 
major  embassies  with  still  another  open  code.  While  the  winds  code  envisioned 
abolition  of  all  communication  with  the  embassies,  this  new  code — called  the 
ingo  denpo  (“hidden  word”)  code — was  intended  for  a less  critical  situation. 
It  seems  to  have  been  arranged  at  the  request  of  the  consul  in  Singapore  in 
case  code  but  not  plain  language  telegrams  were  prohibited.  It  set  up  such 
equivalences  as  arimura  = code  communications  prohibited ; hattori  = 
relations  between  Japan  and  ( name  of  country)  are  not  in  accordance  with

expectation ;*  kodama  = Japan',  kubota  — U.S.S.R. , minami  U.S.A., 
and  so  on.  “In  order  to  distinguish  these  cables  from  others,”  Tokyo  said, 
"the  English  word  stop  will  be  added  at  the  end  as  an  indicator.  (The  Japanese 

word  owari  [end]  will  not  be  used.)” 

The  next  day,  November  28,  the  Navy  cracked  the  transposition  for  the 
j 1 9 message  of  nine  days  earlier  and  learned  of  the  winds  code  arrangement. 
The  cryptanalytic  agencies  saw  at  once  that  this  arrangement,  which  dispensed 
with  the  entire  routine  of  coding,  cabling,  delivery,  and  decoding,  could  give 
several  hours’  advance  warning  of  Japan  s intentions.  They  erupted  into 
activity  to  try  to  intercept  it.  This  wrenched  facilities  away  from  the  commer- 
cial (for  Japanese  diplomatic),  naval,  and  radiotelephone  circuits  with  which 
the  agencies  were  familiar  and  put  them  on  voice  newscasts. 

The  Army  asked  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  to  listen  for 
the  winds  code  execute.  Army  stations  at  Hawaii  and  San  Francisco  tuned  to 
the  newscasts,  as  did  Navy  stations  at  Corregidor,  Hawaii,  and  Bainbridge 
Island,  and  four  or  five  along  the  Atlantic  seaboard.  Rochefort  placed  his 
four  best  language  officers— Lieutenants  Forrest  R.  Biard,  J.  R.  Bromley, 
Allyn  Cole,  Jr.,  and  G.  M.  Slonim— on  a 24-hour  watch  on  frequencies  sug- 
gested by  Washington  and  on  others  that  his  unit  had  found.  The  Dutch  in 
Java  and  the  British  in  Singapore  listened.  In  Washington,  Kramer  made  up 
some  3x5  cards  for  distribution  to  magic  recipients.  They  bore  only  the 
portentous  phrases,  “East  Wind  Rain:  United  States.  North  Wind  Cloudy: 
Russia.  West  Wind  Clear:  England.” 

Soon  plain-language  intercepts  were  swamping  gz.  Bainbridge  ran  up 
bills  of  $60  a day  to  send  them  in.  Kramer  and  the  other  translators,  already 
burdened,  now  had  also  to  scan  100  feet  of  teletype  paper  a day  for  the 
execute;  previously  only  three  to  five  feet  per  week  of  plain-language  material 
had  come  in.  The  long  strips  were  thrown  into  the  wastebasket  and  burned 
after  checking.  Several  times  the  gy  watch  officers  telephoned  Kramer  at  his 
home  at  night  to  ask  him  to  come  to  the  office  and  check  a possible  execute. 
It  always  proved  false. 

Meanwhile,  other  signs  of  increasing  tension  were  not  lacking.  On  the 
29th,  Baron  Oshima  in  Berlin  reported  that  the  German  Foreign  Minister, 
Joachim  von  Ribbentrop,  had  told  him,  “Should  Japan  become  engaged  in  a 
war  against  the  United  States,  Germany,  of  course,  would  join  the  war 
immediately.”  Next  day,  Tokyo  replied,  “Say  very  secretly  to  them  that  there 
is  extreme  danger  that  war  may  suddenly  break  out  between  the  Anglo-Saxon 

* This  is  the  literal  translation  made  by  Mr.  Cory  of  gz  and  given  in  magic.  But  Fried- 
man and  others  have  contended  that  it  does  not  take  into  account  the  Japanese  tendency  to 
speak  in  circumlocution  and  by  indirection.  The  spirit  of  it  might  better  be  rendered  into 
English,  Friedman  suggested,  as  “on  the  brink  of  catastrophe”  or  “on  the  verge  of  disaster.” 
Kramer  conceded  that  the  words  should  not  be  interpreted  as  mildly  as  the  English  seems 
to  indicate,  but  could  imply  “relations  are  reaching  a crisis.”  The  British  translated  this 
phrase  as  “Relations  between  Japan  and  (name  of  country)  are  extremely  critical.

nations  and  Japan  through  some  clash  of  arms  and  add  that  the  time  of  the 
breaking  out  of  this  war  may  come  quicker  than  anyone  dreams.”  Both  these 
messages  were  translated  on  December  1,  and  Roosevelt  considered  the  latter 
so  important  that  he  asked  for  a copy  of  it  to  keep.  Kramer,  after  paraphras- 
ing it  for  security’s  sake,  gave  him  one. 

At  Pearl  Harbor,  Rochefort  had  just  been  presented  with  an  unpleasant 
confirmation  of  that  tautening  situation.  The  Japanese  fleet  reassigned  its 
20,000  radio  call-signs  at  midnight,  December  1 — only  30  days  after  the 
previous  change.  It  was  the  first  time  in  Rochefort’s  experience  that  a switch 
had  occurred  so  soon  after  a previous  one. 

The  one  on  November  1 had  been  expected;  it  had  followed  by  the  usual 
six  months  the  regular  spring  call-sign  shift.  With  the  facility  born  of  long 
experience,  Rochefort’s  Combat  Intelligence  Unit  identified  in  fairly  rapid 
order  the  senders  and  receivers  of  a large  percentage  of  the  traffic.  The  unit 
observed  the  rising  volume  and  southward  routing  of  messages  on  the  200 
radio  circuits  of  the  Japanese  Navy.  This  fitted  in  almost  perfectly  with  the 
widely  known  Japanese  buildup  for  what  the  world  thought  was  a strike  at 
Siam  or  Singapore.  By  the  third  week  in  November,  the  unit  had  sensed  the 
formation  of  a Third  Fleet  task  force  and  its  imminent  departure  in  the  direc- 
tion of  those  areas.  Aircraft  carriers  were  not  addressed  during  this  buildup, 
nor  did  they  transmit.  To  Rochefort,  the  situation  shaped  up  like  those  of 
February  and  July,  when  Japanese  fleet  units  moved  south  to  support  the 
takeover  in  French  Indochina  while  the  carriers  remained  in  home  waters  as 
a reserve.  They  were  there,  he  felt,  to  protect  the  exposed  flank  of  the  Japanese 
forces  from  the  American  fleet,  which,  from  its  bases  at  Cavite  and  Pearl, 
could  sever  the  supply  lines  of  the  aggressor. 

Rochefort’s  view  was  shared  by  fleet  intelligence  officer  Layton.  He  knew 
that  the  two  main  carrier  divisions  had  not  appeared  in  the  traffic  for  at  least 
two  weeks,  and  maybe  three.  He  suspected  their  presence  in  home  waters, 
but  since  he  lacked  positive  indications  of  it,  he  omitted  his  presumptions 
from  a report  on  the  Japanese  fleet  that  he  submitted  to  Kimmel  on  December 
1.  Whereupon,  Layton  recalled: 


Admiral  Kimmel  said,  “What!  You  don’t  know  where  Carrier  Division  1 
and  Carrier  Division  2 are!" 

I replied,  “No,  sir,  I do  not.  I think  they  are  in  home  waters,  but  I do  not 
know  where  they  are.  The  rest  of  these  units,  I feel  pretty  confident  of  their 
location.”  Then  Admiral  Kimmel  looked  at  me,  as  sometimes  he  would,  with 
somewhat  a stern  countenance  and  yet  partially  with  a twinkle  in  his  eye,  and 
said: 

“Do  you  mean  to  say  that  they  could  be  rounding  Diamond  Head  and  you 
wouldn’t  know  it?”  or  words  to  that  effect.  My  reply  was  that  “I  hope  they 
would  be  sighted  before  now,”  or  words  to  that  effect. 


40 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


On  the  same  day  that  Layton  gave  his  report  to  Kimmel,  the  Office  of 
Naval  Intelligence  produced  a memorandum  of  “Japanese  Fleet  Locations” 
that  Layton,  when  he  saw  it,  considered  as  “dotting  the  i’s  and  crossing  the 
t’s”  of  his  own  estimates.  It  placed  Akagi  and  Kaga  (Carrier  Division  1),  and 
Koryu  and  Kasuga  in  southern  Kyushu  waters,  and  Soryu  and  Hiryu  (Carrier 
Division  2)  and  Zuikaku,  Shokaku,  Hosho,  and  Ryujo  at  the  great  naval  base 
of  Kure.  All  this  was  just  a more  precise  way  of  saying  “home  waters. 

These  estimates  were  based  on  the  November  observations.  The  call-sign 
change  of  December  1 obliterated  the  intricate  communication  networks 
that  the  radio  intelligence  units  had  so  painstakingly  built  up  and  forced  them 
to  begin  anew.  The  Japanese  bedeviled  them  with  new  communication- 
security  measures.  Dispatches  were  sent  “on  the  umbrella” — broadcast  to  the 
fleet  at  large  and  copied  by  all  ships.  This  sort  of  blanket  coverage  made 
identification  difficult.  Multiple  addresses  were  used.  They  sent  dummy 
traffic,  which,  however,  did  not  confuse  the  listeners.  Just  before  the  change, 
the  communicators  passed  many  old  messages.  Rochefort  s unit  spotted 
them,  and  guessed  that  they  were  attempts  either  to  pad  the  volume  or  to  get 
through  to  the  addressee  before  the  change  caused  routing  difficulties. 

On  December  2,  after  only  two  days  of  analyzing  the  new  calls,  Rochefort’s 
unit  stated  in  its  Communications  Intelligence  Summary:  “Carriers  Almost 
a complete  blank  of  information  of  the  Carriers  today.  Lack  of  identifications 
has  somewhat  promoted  this  lack  of  information.  However,  since  over  two 
hundred  service  calls  have  been  partially  identified  since  the  change  on  the 
first  of  December  and  not  one  carrier  call  has  been  recovered,  it  is  evident  that 
carrier  traffic  is  at  a low  ebb.”  In  the  next  day’s  summary  appeared  the  last 
mention  of  carriers  before  December  7,  and  it  was  rather  negative:  No 
information  on  submarines  or  carriers.” 

Other  messages,  however,  clearly  indicated  the  drive  to  the  south,  which 
Japan  made  no  attempt  to  conceal.  Twice  before,  Rochefort,  Fabian,  Layton, 
and  O.N.I.  had  seen  exactly  the  same  conditions,  and  twice  before  their 
reasoning  that  the  carriers  were  being  held  in  empire  waters  had  been  proved 
right.  Now,  they  thought,  they  were  seeing  it  happen  again.  Temporarily 
oblivious  to  the  possibility  of  a surprise  attack  on  Pearl  Harbor,  they  watched 
the  forces  moving  against  Malaya  as  hypnotically  as  a conjuror  s audience 
stares  at  the  empty  right  hand  while  the  left  is  pulling  the  ace  out  of  a sleeve. 

American  preconceptions  were  reinforced  by  two  purple  messages  of 
December  1,  which  the  Navy  read  that  same  day.  In  the  first,  Tokyo  directed 
Washington : “When  you  are  faced  with  the  necessity  of  destroying  codes,  get 
in  touch  with  the  naval  attache’s  office  there  and  make  use  of  chemicals  they 
have  on  hand  for  this  purpose.  The  attache  should  have  been  advised  by  the 
Navy  Ministry  regarding  this.”  Five  days  earlier,  the  cryptanalysts  had  read 
Tokyo’s  detailed  instructions  on  how  to  destroy  the  purple  machine  in  an 
emergency.  These  two  code-destruction  messages  appeared  to  be  just  pre- 


41 


One  Day  of  Magic 

cautionary  measures  in  a tense  situation,  and  this  impression  was  strengthened 
by  the  second  message  of  December  1.  It  seemed  to  virtually  announce  a 
Japanese  invasion  of  British  and  Dutch  possessions  and  to  relegate  conflict 
with  the  United  States  to  a subsequent  date:  “The  four  offices  in  London, 
Hongkong,  Singapore  and  Manila  have  been  instructed  to  abandon  the  use 
of  the  code  machines  and  to  dispose  of  them.  The  machine  in  Batavia  has 
been  returned  to  Japan.  Regardless  of  the  contents  of  my  circular  message 
#2447  [which  magic  did  not  have],  the  U.S.  (office)  retains  the  machines  and 
the  machine  codes.”  American  officials  breathed  easier.  The  messages  ap- 
peared to  give  the  United  States  a bit  more  of  what  it  needed  most — time, 
time  to  build  up  its  pitifully  weak  Army  and  Navy. 

While  the  world  gazed  with  tunnel  vision  toward  Southeast  Asia,  and 
American  radio  intelligence  envisioned  the  Japanese  carriers  in  home  waters, 
six  of  them — Akagi,  Kaga,  Hiryu,  Soryu,  Shokaku,  and  Zuikaku — were  in 
fact  butting  eastward  through  the  high  winds  and  waves  of  the  vacant  sea. 
Late  in  the  afternoon  of  December  2,  Tokyo  time,  the  force  picked  up, 
apparently  on  a blanket  broadcast,  an  electrifying  open-code  message 
intended  for  it:  niitaka-yama  nobore  (“Climb  Mount  Niitaka”).  It  informed 
the  strike  force  that  the  decision  for  war  had  been  made  and  directed  it  to 
Proceed  with  attack.  Niitaka-yama,  also  known  as  Mount  Morrison,  is  a peak 
on  Formosa  whose  12,956-foot  elevation  made  it  the  highest  point  of  what 
was  then  the  Japanese  empire.  The  symbolism  could  not  have  been  lost  on 
the  officers.  The  force  refueled  from  its  tankers. 

There  was  trouble  in  Honolulu.  The  F.B.I.  had,  early  in  November,  begun 
to  tap  the  telephone  of  the  manager  of  an  important  Japanese  firm  in  the  hope 
of  obtaining  some  clues  to  possible  espionage  activity.  The  tap  was  in  addition 
to  those  placed  on  the  Japanese  consulate  by  Mayfield,  who  was  helped  by  an 
employee  of  the  telephone  company  whom  the  14th  Naval  District  Intellig- 
ence Office  had  cultivated  as  its  contact.  Unexpectedly,  however,  a telephone 
repairman  came  across  the  jumper  wire  that  the  F.B.I.  had  put  across  the 
connections  in  the  junction  box.  The  Navy’s  contact  man  immediately  tipped 
off  Mayfield’s  office,  which  warned  the  F.B.I. — who  promptly  complained  to 
the  telephone  company  that  their  confidence  had  been  breached.  Mayfield, 
fearful  that  the  commotion  would  disclose  his  own  telephone  surveillances 
and  that  such  disclosure  would  give  the  Japanese  an  excuse  for  almost  any 
action,  pulled  his  taps.  His  recording  operator  jotted  a wistful  farewell  under 
his  final  notes.  “At  4 p.m.  Honolulu  time  in  the  1941st  year  of  Our  Lord, 
December  2 inst.,  I bade  my  adieu  to  you  my  friend  of  22  months  standing. 
Darn  if  I won’t  miss  you!!  Requiescat  in  Peace.”  The  F.B.I.,  however,  main- 
tained its  other  taps. 

Earlier  that  day,  the  consulate  had  received  Circular  #2445  in  j 1 9,  relayed 
by  Washington  from  Tokyo: 


42 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Take  great  pains  that  this  does  not  leak  out. 

You  are  to  take  the  following  measures  immediately : 

1 . With  the  exception  of  one  copy  each  of  the  o [pa-k2]  and  the  l [la]  codes, 
you  are  to  burn  all  telegraph  codes  (this  includes  the  codebooks  for  communica- 
tion between  the  three  departments  [hato]  and  those  for  use  by  the  Navy). 

2.  As  soon  as  you  have  completed  this  operation,  wire  the  one  word  haruna. 

3.  Burn  all  secret  records  of  incoming  and  outgoing  telegrams. 

4.  Taking  care  not  to  arouse  outside  suspicion,  dispose  of  all  secret  docu- 
ments in  the  same  way. 

Since  these  measures  are  in  preparation  for  an  emergency,  keep  this  within 
your  consulate  and  carry  out  your  duties  with  calmness  and  care. 

The  codes  were  duly  burned,  including  the  tsu,  or  J 1 9,  in  which  the  cir- 
cular was  transmitted.  That  evening  Kita  sent  haruna.  Henceforth  the  con- 
sulate code  secretary,  Samon  Tsukikawa,  would  have  to  transmit  the  spy 
messages  of  Yoshikawa,  alias  Morimura,  in  the  simpler  pa-k2. 

The  first  such  message  arranged  four  signaling  systems  by  which  a spy 
might  report  on  the  condition  of  the  ships  in  Pearl  Harbor.  The  arrangement 
had  been  submitted  to  Yoshikawa  by  an  Axis  spy  in  Hawaii,  Bernhard  Julius 
Otto  Kuhn.  Nazi  Propaganda  Minister  Josef  Goebbels  had  transferred  him 
to  the  islands  in  1935  after  a contretemps  with  Kuhn’s  daughter  Ruth,  who 
had  become  Goebbels’  mistress  when  she  was  16.  In  his  signaling  system, 
Kuhn  stipulated  that  numbers  from  1 to  8 would  mean  such  things  as  A 
number  of  carriers  preparing  to  sortie  (which  was  2)  and  Several  carriers 
departed  between  4th  and  6th  (which  was  7).  Then  he  arranged  that  bonfires, 
house  lights  shown  at  certain  times  and  places,  or  want  ads  broadcast  over 
radio  station  kgmg  would  mean  certain  numbers.  For  example,  7 would  be 
represented  by  two  lights  shown  in  the  window  of  a house  on  Lanikai  Beach 
between  2 and  3 a.m.,  or  by  two  sheets  between  10  and  1 1 a.m.,  by  lights  in 
the  attic  window  of  a house  in  Kalama  between  1 1 and  12  p.m.,  or  by  a want 
ad  offering  a complete  chicken  farm  for  sale  and  listing  P.O.  Box  1476.  If  all 
these  failed,  a bonfire  on  a certain  peak  of  Maui  Island  between  8 and  9 p.m. 
would  indicate  7.  The  purpose  of  the  system  was  to  eliminate  dangerous 
personal  contacts  between  KUhn  and  the  Japanese.  Kuhn  tested  it  on  Decem- 
ber 2,  found  that  it  worked,  and  passed  it  to  Yoshikawa.  He  had  it  encoded 
(in  pa-k2)  and  sent  to  Tokyo  in  two  long  parts  on  December  3. 

It  was  now  the  third  day  of  the  month  in  which  the  Japanese  consulate 
gave  its  cable  business  to  R.C.A.  Following  Sarnoff’s  instructions,  George 
Street,  district  manager  of  the  firm,  had  had  the  Japanese  consulate  messages 
copied  on  a blank  sheet  of  paper  with  no  identification  of  the  sender  or 
addressee.  About  10  or  11  a.m.,  December  3,  Mayfield  called  at  the  branch 
office  and  Street  slipped  him  a blank  envelope  containing  the  messages.  As 
soon  as  Mayfield  returned  to  the  District  Intelligence  Office,  he  had  a messen- 
ger bring  them  down  to  Rochefort. 

In  Washington  that  Wednesday,  the  Signal  Intelligence  Service  solved  a

purple  message  from  Tokyo — and  the  readers  of  magic,  who  only  two  days 
earlier  had  been  lulled  by  the  supposition  that  Japan  might  temporarily  spare 
the  United  States,  were  stunned  by  the  realization  that  the  arrow  of  war  might 
be  loosed  momentarily.  For  the  message  ordered  the  Washington  embassy  to 
“burn  all  [codes]  but  those  now  used  with  the  machine  and  one  copy  each  of 
o code  [pa-k2]  and  abbreviating  code  [la].  . . . Stop  at  once  using  one  code 
machine  unit  and  destroy  it  completely  . . . wire  . . . haruna.”  Under  Secre- 
tary of  State  Welles  saw  it  and  felt  that  “the  chances  had  diminished  from  one

HARUIU 


Consul  Nagao  Kita  sends  the  codeword  haruna  to  report  his  codes  destroyed 


in  a thousand  to  one  in  a million  that  war  could  then  be  avoided.”  When  the 
President’s  naval  aide,  Beardall,  brought  the  message  to  Roosevelt,  he  said  in 
substance,  “Mr.  President,  this  is  a very  significant  dispatch.”  After  the  Chief 
Executive  had  read  it  carefully,  he  asked  Beardall,  “When  do  you  think  it  will 
happen?” — referring  to  the  outbreak  of  war.  “Most  any  time,”  replied  the 
naval  aide,  who  thought  that  the  moment  was  getting  very  close. 

At  the  Japanese  embassy  at  2514  Massachusetts  Avenue,  the  code  clerks 
were  executing  these  destruction  orders.  The  code  room  stood  at  the  southeast 
corner  of  the  embassy,  with  windows  overlooking  the  embassy  parking  lot 
and  another  legation  next  door.  Half  a dozen  desks  clustered  in  the  middle 
of  the  room.  Two  cipher  machines  waited  on  desks  against  the  west  wall  and 
a third,  broken,  rested  in  the  walk-in  safe.  In  utter  disregard  of  the  regulations 


44 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


promulgated  for  the  security  of  communications,  the  embassy  had  hired  an 
elderly  Negro  janitor  named  Robert  to  dust  and  clean  the  code  room  and  its 
supersecret  furnishings  each  day.  The  code  clerks  did  make  some  obeisance 
to  the  security  regulations  by  not  allowing  him  in  the  room  unless  some 
Japanese  were  in  it.  But  the  situation  was,  to  say  the  least,  ironical.  While  the 
Japanese  Foreign  Office  was  exercising  almost  superhuman  security  precau- 
tions and  American  cryptanalysts  were  suffering  nervous  breakdowns  to 
solve  the  purple  machine,  an  American  citizen  was  running  his  duster  over 
tables  on  which  stood  the  intricate  machines  that  were  the  vortex  of  this 
silent  struggle. 

But  just  as  the  Japanese  seemed  not  to  have  given  serious  thought  to  the 
possibility  of  Robert’s  being  a spy,  so  the  Americans  seemed  to  have  given  no 
serious  thought  to  the  possibility  that  a spy  might  have  been  insinuated  into 
the  Japanese  embassy  to  ease  their  cryptanalytic  burden.  Of  course,  even  if 
they  had  thought  about  it,  they  might  have  rejected  the  idea,  for  discovery  of 
the  spy  would  have  meant  an  automatic  change  of  codes.  The  danger  of  this 
was  much  less  if  the  systems  were  read  through  cryptanalysis. 

The  paper  codes  of  the  Japanese  consisted  of  folders  whose  four  or  six 
pages  could  be  opened  into  a single  long  sheet.  Embassy  Counselor  Sadao 
Iguchi,  who  was  in  charge  of  the  code  room,  directed  telegraph  officer  Masana 
Horiuchi  and  code  clerks  Takeshi  Kajiwara,  Hiroshi  Hori,  Juichi  Yoshida, 
Tsukao  Kawabata,  and  Kenichiro  Kondo  in  the  burning  of  the  paper  codes. 
Demolition  of  the  code  machine  was  more  complicated,  and  followed  the 
guidelines  transmitted  recently  by  the  Foreign  Office.  The  machines  were 
dismantled  with  a screwdriver,  hammered  into  unrecognizability,  and  then 
dissolved  in  acid  from  the  naval  attache’s  office  to  destroy  them  thoroughly. 
Some  of  these  operations  were  carried  out  in  the  gardens  of  the  embassy;  so 
when  Bratton,  who  had  read  the  code-destruction  intelligence,  sent  an  officer 
to  the  embassy  to  check,  he  obtained  immediate  confirmation. 

Now  the  American  officials  realized  the  ominous  meaning  of  the  haruna 
messages  that  had  been  intercepted  as  they  were  sent  from  New  York,  New 
Orleans,  and  Havana  and  that  had  been  received  just  that  day  in  S.I.S.  The 
Army  and  Navy  high  command  universally  regarded  the  destruction  of  codes 
as  virtual  certainty  that  war  would  break  out  within  the  next  few  days.  As 
Stark’s  deputy  put  it:  “If  you  rupture  diplomatic  negotiations  you  do  not 
necessarily  have  to  burn  your  codes.  The  diplomats  go  home,  and  they  can 
pack  up  their  codes  with  their  dolls  and  take  them  home.  Also,  when  you 
rupture  diplomatic  negotiations  you  do  not  rupture  consular  relations.  The 
consuls  stay  on.  Now,  in  this  particular  set  of  dispatches  they  not  only  told 
their  diplomats  in  Washington  and  London  to  burn  their  codes,  but  they  told 
their  consuls  in  Manila,  in  Hong  Kong,  Singapore,  and  Batavia  to  burn  their 
codes  and  that  did  not  mean  a rupture  of  diplomatic  relations;  it  meant  war. 

A few  hours  after  the  code-destruction  magic  reached  Stark,  he  dispatched 
the  electrifying  news  to  Kimmel  and  Hart: 


45 


One  Day  of  Magic 

Highly  reliable  information  has  been  received  that  categoric  and  urgent 
instructions  were  sent  yesterday  to  Japanese  diplomatic  and  consular  posts  at 
Hongkong  X Singapore  X Batavia  X Manila  X Washington  and  London  to 
destroy  most  of  their  codes  and  ciphers  at  once  and  to  burn  all  other  important 
confidential  and  secret  documents  X 

He  followed  this  five  minutes  later  with  another  message: 

Circular  twenty  four  forty  four  from  Tokyo  one  December  ordered  London 
X Hongkong  X Singapore  and  Manila  to  destroy  purple  machine  XX  Batavia 
machine  already  sent  to  Tokyo  XX  December  second  Washington  also  directed 
destroy  purple  X all  but  one  copy  of  other  systems  X and  all  secret  documents 
XX  British  Admiralty  London  today  reports  embassy  London  has  complied 

In  Washington  urgency  drove  out  all  thoughts  of  security.  The  strict  injunction 
against  ever  mentioning  magic  was  completely  overlooked.  When  Kimmel 
got  the  message,  he  asked  Layton  what  “purple”  was.  So  tight  had  security 
been  that  neither  of  them  knew.  They  checked  with  Lieutenant  Herbert  M. 
Coleman,  the  fleet  security  officer,  who  told  them  that  it  was  a cipher  machine 
similar  to  the  Navy’s. 

Marshall  authorized  his  intelligence  chief,  Brigadier  General  Sherman 
Miles,  to  direct  the  military  attache  in  Tokyo  to  destroy  most  of  his  codes  and 
ciphers: 

Memorize  emergency  key  word  # 2 for  use  of  signud  without  repeat  without 
indicators  destroy  document  Stop  signnq  sigpap  and  signdt  should  be  retained 
and  used  for  all  communications  except  as  last  resort  when  these  documents 
should  be  destroyed  and  memorized  signud  used  Stop  Destroy  all  other  War 
Department  ciphers  and  codes  at  once  and  notify  by  codeword  binab  Stop  Early 
rupture  of  diplomatic  relations  with  Japan  has  been  indicated  State  Department 
informed  you  may  advise  ambassador 

Next  day  after  lunch  the  Navy  followed  suit  in  advising  its  Far  Eastern 
attaches : 

Destroy  this  system  at  discretion  and  report  by  word  jabberwock  Destroy  all 
registered  publications  except  CSP  1085  and  6 and  1007  and  1008  and  this 
system  and  report  execution  by  sending  in  plain  language  boomerang 

At  8:45  p.m.  that  night,  Thursday,  December  4,  the  watch  officer  of  the 
F.C.C.’s  Radio  Intelligence  Division  telephoned  the  Office  of  Naval  Intelli- 
gence to  ask  if  it  could  accept  a certain  message.  The  O.N.I.  officer  was  not 
sure  and  said  he  would  call  back . At  9 : 05  gy  watch  officer  Brotherhood  called 
the  F.C.C.  and  was  given  a Japanese  weather  report  that  sounded  like  some- 
thing the  F.C.C.  man  had  been  told  to  listen  for.  He  read  it  to  Brotherhood: 
“Tokyo:  today — wind  slightly  stronger,  may  become  cloudy  tonight;  to- 
morrow— slightly  cloudy  and  fine  weather.  Kanagawa  prefecture:  today — 
north  wind  cloudy;  from  afternoon — more  clouds.  Chiba  prefecture:  today — 
north  wind  clear,  may  become  slightly  cloudy.  Ocean  surface:  calm.” 
Brotherhood  was  relieved  that  it  included  nothing  about  east  wind  rain,

which  would  have  meant  the  United  States,  but  in  any  case  this  message 
seemed  to  lack  something  that  would  have  been  required  in  a true  execute. 
For  one  thing,  the  phrase  north  wind  cloudy,  which  would  have  meant 
Russia,  was  not  repeated  twice.  Nevertheless,  Brotherhood  telephoned  Rear 
Admiral  Leigh  Noyes,  director  of  naval  communications,  who  remarked  that 
he  thought  the  wind  was  blowing  from  a funny  direction.  The  consensus  was 
that  it  was  not  a genuine  execute,  and  the  search  continued. 

In  Tokyo,  where  it  was  December  5,  Foreign  Minister  Togo  received 
representatives  of  the  Army  and  Navy  general  staffs.  A general  and  an  admiral 
wanted  to  discuss  the  delicate  matter  of  the  precise  timing  of  Japan's  final  note 
to  the  United  States.  Drafted  in  English  by  the  director  of  the  Foreign  Office’s 
American  bureau,  the  note  had  been  approved  by  the  Liaison  Conference,  a 
six-man  war  cabinet,  at  its  meeting  the  day  before.  It  rejected  Hull’s  offer  of 
the  26th  and  concluded:  “The  Japanese  Government  regrets  to  have  to  notify 
hereby  the  American  Government  that  in  view  of  the  attitude  of  the  American 
Government  it  cannot  but  consider  that  it  is  impossible  to  reach  an  agreement 
through  further  negotiations.” 

Article  I of  the  1 907  Hague  Convention  governing  the  laws  of  war  provides 
that  “ . . . hostilities  . . . must  not  commence  without  previous  and  explicit 
warning,  in  the  form  either  of  a reasoned  declaration  of  war  or  of  an  ulti- 
matum with  conditional  declaration  of  war.”  Togo  had  suggested  to  the 
Liaison  Conference  that  the  note  was  far  stronger  than  an  ultimatum  and  that 
to  include  a specific  declaration  of  war  would  be  merely  to  reiterate  the 
obvious.”  The  conferees  had  gratefully  acceded  to  this  casuistry,  since  it 
enabled  them  to  comply  with  the  prior-notification  requirement  without 
endangering  the  surprise  of  the  attack.  Since  the  Hague  Convention  does  not 
specify  how  long  in  advance  such  notification  must  be  given,  Premier  Tojo 
and  the  other  conferees  thought  to  shave  the  time  as  much  as  possible.  Dawn 
in  Hawaii  was  about  noon  in  Washington.  The  Liaison  Conference  had 
tentatively  set  12:30  p.m.,  Sunday,  December  7 (Washington  time),  as  the 
time  of  delivery  of  the  note. 

But  when  the  two  military  men  called  upon  Togo  the  next  day  to  fix  the 
exact  time,  Vice  Admiral  Seiichi  Ito,'  vice  chief  of  the  naval  general  staff,  told 
the  foreign  minister  [Togo  later  wrote]  “that  the  high  command  had  found  it 
necessary  to  postpone  presentation  of  the  document  thirty  minutes  beyond  the 
time  previously  agreed  upon,  and  that  they  wanted  my  consent  thereto.  I asked 
the  reason  for  the  delay,  and  Ito  said  that  it  was  because  he  had  miscalculated. 
...  I inquired  further  what  period  of  time  would  be  allowed  between  notifica- 
tion and  attack;  but  Ito  declined  to  answer  this,  on  the  plea  of  operational 
secrecy.  I persisted,  demanding  assurance  that  even  with  the  hour  of  delivery 
changed  from  twelve-thirty  to  one  there  would  remain  a sufficient  time  there- 
after before  the  attack  occurred;  this  assurance  Ito  gave.  With  this— being 
able  to  learn  no  more— I assented  to  his  request.  In  leaving,  Ito  said:  ‘We 


47 


One  Day  of  Magic 

want  you  not  to  cable  the  notification  to  the  Embassy  in  Washington  too 
early.’  ” In  this  demand  lay  the  seeds  of  Japan’s  juridical  culpability. 

Yoshikawa,  in  Honolulu,  had  continued  sending  his  ship-disposition 
reports  after  the  switch  to  pa-k2.  They  were  an  odd  melange  of  accuracy, 
error,  and  outright  falsehoods.  On  December  3,  for  example,  he  correctly 
reported  that  the  liner  Lurline  had  arrived  from  San  Francisco  but  stated  that 
a military  transport  had  departed  when  no  such  thing  had  occurred.  The  next 
day  he  informed  Tokyo  about  the  hasty  departure  of  a cruiser  of  the  Honolulu 
class;  no  such  ship  either  entered  or  cleared  the  harbor  on  the  4th.  Then, 
on  the  5th,  he  cabled  that  three  battleships  had  arrived  in  Pearl  Harbor,  mak- 
ing a total — which  he  reported  with  deadly  accuracy — of  eight  anchored  in 
the  harbor.  His  messages,  sent  over  Kita’s  signature,  were  decoded  in  the 
Foreign  Office  and  routed  to  the  North  American  section,  where  Toshikazu 
Kase  passed  them  immediately  to  the  Navy  Ministry.  Here  they  were  re- 
drafted, encoded  in  a naval  code,  and  transmitted  on  a special  frequency  not 
normally  used  by  the  Navy  and  without  any  direct  address  to  the  Pearl  Harbor 
strike  force.  Commander  Koshi  decoded  it  and  brought  to  his  chief  this  latest 
information. 

The  communication-security  precautions  paid  off.  Whether  or  not  the 
messages  slipped  by  the  American  radio  monitors  in  Hawaii  mattered  little. 
Mere  interception  would  not  have  helped  much.  The  messages  bore  no 
external  indication  of  their  intended  recipient,  and  they  could  not  have  been 
read.  Rochefort’s  attack  on  Japanese  naval  codes  had  achieved  some  minor 
successes  in  late  October  and  November,  but  he  could  read  only  about  10  per 
cent  of  the  naval  traffic,  and  much  of  this  consisted  of  weather  and  other 
minor  systems.  The  information  obtained,  Rochefort  said,  “was  not  in  any 
sense  vital.”  Cavite  was.spottily  reading  jn25  messages — which  revealed 
nothing  about  Pearl  Harbor — until  December  4,  when  the  superencipherment 
was  suddenly  changed.  As  a message  that  moved  on  the  coper  channel  put  it: 
“Five  numeral  intercepts  subsequent  to  zero  six  hundred  today  indicate 
change  of  cipher  system  including  complete  change  differentials  and  indicator 
subtractors  X All  intercepts  received  since  time  indicated  checked  against  all 
differentials  three  previous  systems  X No  dupes.”  Corregidor  was  not  to  get 
the  initial  break  into  the  new  superencipherment  until  December  8.  And  the 
only  other  system  in  which  the  Yoshikawa  messages  might  have  been  for- 
warded— the  flag  officers’  system — remained  unsolved. 

A possibility  of  warning  was  opened  at  the  source,  however,  when 
Yoshikawa’s  original  messages  became  available  to  Rochefort’s  unit.  May- 
field  had  picked  up  another  batch  of  cables  in  the  surreptitious  fashion  from 
Street  on  Friday  morning  and  immediately  sent  them  down  to  Rochefort’s 
unit  by  messenger.  Solving  them  was  not  part  of  its  duty,*  but  when  a superior

assigned  the  messages  to  Chief  Radioman  Farnsley  C.  Woodward  39,  who 
had  had  some  experience  with  Japanese  diplomatic  codes  at  the  Shang  ai 
station  from  1938  to  1940.  He  had  some  help  from  Lieutenant  Commanders 
Thomas  H Dyer,  Rochefort’s  senior  cryptanalyst,  and  Wesley  A.  Wrig  , 
Dyer’s  assistant.  Although  the  unit  was  not  working  on  the  dip  omat.c 
systems,  it  had  information  on  them  in  the  Navy’s  R.I.P.s,  or  Radio  Inte  ig- 
ence  Publications,  with  which  all  radio  intelligence  units  were  supplied.  The 
R 1 P gave  however,  only  the  pa  code  list,  leaving  the  onerous  reconstruction 
of  the  current  k2  transposition  to  the  cryptanalyst.  The  half-dozen  or  so 
dispatches,  plus  some  in  la,  reached  Woodward  about  1 :30  or  2 p.m.  Friday 
and  he  immediately  began  the  first  of  a series  of  12-  and  14-hour  days  to  rea 
them  He  had  no  difficulty  with  the  la  messages,  which  were  translated  into 
English  by  Marine  Corps  Captain  Alva  Lasswell,  but  these  yielded  nothing 
but  junk.”  The  k2,  however,  eluded  him,  and  he  worked  on  it  far  into  t e 

n'8  At  about  5 p.m.  that  day,  a trans-Pacific  telephone  call  came  through  to 
Mrs  Motokazu  Mori,  wife  of  a dentist  prominent  in  Hawaii’s  Japanese  com- 
munity. She  was  the  Honolulu  correspondent  for  the  militaristic  Tokyo  news- 
paper'Yomiuri  Shirnbm.  Mrs.  Mori  had  received  a wire  from  her  editor  the 
previous  day  asking  her  to  arrange  a telephone  interview  with  * P~e"t 
Japanese  on  conditions  in  Hawaii.  She  cabled  an  acknowledgment  but,  unable 
to  get  anyone,  she  took  the  call  herself. 

Yomiuri : Hello,  is  this  Mori : 

Mrs.  Mori:  Hello.  This  is  Mori. 

Yomiuri'.  I am  sorry  to  have  troubled  you.  Thank  you  very  muc  . 

Mrs.  Mori:  Not  at  all.  , 

Yomiuri'.  ...  I would  like  to  have  your  impression  on  the  conditions  you  are 
observing  at  present.  Are  airplanes  flying  daily? 

Mrs.  Mori:  Yes,  lots  of  them  fly  around. 

Yomiuri:  Are  they  large  planes? 

Mrs.  Mori:  Yes,  they  are  quite  big. 

Yomiuri:  Are  they  flying  from  morning  till  night? 

Mrs.  Mori:  Well,  not  to  that  extent,  but  last  week  they  were  quite  active  in 
the  air. 

There  ensued  Q-and-A  about  the  number  of  sailors,  relations  between 
Japanese  and  Americans,  factory  construction,  population  growth,  whether 
the  airplanes  earned  searchlights,  Hawaii  weather,  newspaper  comment,  and 
comparison  of  impressions  made  during  stopovers  in  Hawaii  by  two  ambas- 
sadors to  the  United  States,  Kurusu  of  Japan  and  Maxim  Litvmoff  of  Russia. 
The  interview  continued: 

Yomiuri-  Do  you  know  anything  about  the  United  States  fleet? 

Mrs  Mori : No,  1 don’t  know  anything  about  the  fleet.  Since  we  try  to  avoid 
talking  about  such  matters,  we  do  not  know  much  about  the  fleet.  At  any  rate, 


One  Day  of  Magic  49 

the  fleet  here  seems  small.  I don’t  [know  if]  all  of  the  fleet  has  done  this,  but  it 

seems  that  the  fleet  has  left  here. 

Yomiuri:  Is  that  so?  What  kind  of  flowers  are  in  bloom  in  Hawaii  at  present? 

Mrs.  Mori:  Presently,  the  flowers  in  bloom  are  fewest  out  of  the  whole  year. 

However,  the  hibiscus  and  the  poinsettia  are  in  bloom  now. 

The  editor  seemed  a little  confused  about  the  hibiscus,  but  the  interview  conr 
tinued  with  discussions  about  liquor  and  the  number  of  first-  and  second- 
generation  Japanese.  Finally  the  editor  thanked  Mrs.  Mori.  She  asked  him  to 
hold  on  for  a moment,  but  he  had  already  hung  up. 

Unknown  to  both  of  them,  someone  had  been  listening.  And  that  someone 
thought  that  the  talk  about  hibiscus  and  poinsettias  sounded  mighty  suspi- 
cious— especially  on  an  expensive  transoceanic  telephone  connection,  and 
especially  at  a time  of  extraordinarily  tense  relations. 

In  Tokyo  it  was  a little  after  1 p.m.  on  Saturday,  December  6.  The  Japanese 
reply  to  Hull’s  note  of  the  26th  had  recently  been  sent  to  the  cable  room  of 
the  Foreign  Ministry  for  transmission  to  the  embassy  in  Washington.  Kazuji 
Kameyama,  the  cable  chief,  broke  it  into  fourteen  approximately  equal  parts 
to  facilitate  handling  and  ordered  these  enciphered  on  the  97-shiki  O-bun  In- 
ji-ki.  He  also  enciphered  a shorter  “pilot”  message  from  Togo  alerting  the 
embassy  that  the  reply  was  on  the  way  and  instructing  it  “to  put  it  in  nicely 
drafted  form  and  make  every  preparation  to  present  it  to  the  Americans  just 
as  soon  as  you  receive  instructions.”  At  8:30  p.m.,  the  pilot  message  was 
telegraphed  from  the  cable  room  to  Tokyo's  Central  Telegraph  Office,  from 
where,  45  minutes  later,  it  was  radioed  to  the  United  States.  Bainbridge 
Island  intercepted  it  and  relayed  it  to  op-20-g.  By  five  minutes  past  noon  on 
Saturday,  December  6 (Washington  time),  op-20-g  had  delivered  the  teletype 
copy  to  S.I.S.,  which  promptly  ran  it  through  the  purple  machine.  By  2 p.m. 
Bratton  had  it,  translated  and  typed.  An  hour  later  it  was  in  the  hands  of  the 
Army  distributees.  S.I.S.  had  officially  closed  at  1 p.m.  and  was  not  due  to  re- 
open until  6,  when  it  was  to  go  on  24-hour  status.  But  this  notification  of  the 
imminent  receipt  of  the  long-awaited  reply  to  Hull’s  note  of  the  26th  led  to 
telephoning  employees  Mary  J . Dunning  and  Ray  Cave  about  2 : 30  and  asking 
them  to  report  to  work.  By  4 both  were  there. 

In  Tokyo,  Kameyama  had  released  the  first  13  parts  of  the  Japanese  note 
to  the  Central  Telegraph  Office.  Following  the  .instructions  of  the  American 
bureau,  he  retained  the  crucial  14th  part,  which  broke  off  negotiations.  Shortly 
after  10  p.m.,  commercial  radio  began  sending  the  13  parts  to  Washington. 
Most  of  them  took  less  than  ten  minutes  to  transmit,  but  even  though  two 
transmitters  were  used,  it  was  not  until  two  minutes  before  2 a.m.  that  the 
tail  of  the  last  part  had  gone.  Bainbridge,  of  course,  was  listening,  and  it 
picked  the  parts  up  in  this  order:  1,  2,  3,  4,  10,  9,  5,  12,  7,  11,  6,  13,  8.  One 
batch  arrived  by  teletype  at  op-20-g  at  eleven  minutes  before  noon,  Saturday, 
December  6,  Washington  time,  and  the  other  at  nine  minutes  of  3 that

afternoon.  Though  it  was  Saturday,  December  6,  an  even  date  and  hence  an 
Army  date  of  responsibility,  the  Navy  handled  the  dispatches  because  it  knew 
that  S.l.S.  was  not  expected  to  work  that  afternoon,  and  it  considered  the 
intercepts  of  great  importance.  Decryptment  did  not  go  very  smoothly,  how- 
ever. Something  seemed  to  be  in  error,  gy  knew  the  key,  but  it  was  producing 
garbles  every  few  letters.  The  cryptanalysts  tried  to  correct  them. 

Meanwhile,  a decode  into  Japanese  of  the  long  pa-k2  message  that  Yoshi- 
kawa  had  sent  concerning  Kuhn’s  visual-signal  system  for  Hawaii  was  placed 
on  the  desk  of  Mrs.  Edgers  in  gz.  “At  first  glance,”  she  said,  “this  seemed  to 
be  more  interesting  than  some  of  the  other  messages  I had  in  my  basket,  and 
so  I selected  it  and  asked  one  of  the  other  men,  who  were  also  translators 
working  on  other  messages,  whether  or  not  this  shouldn  t be  done  immediately 
and  was  told  that  I should  and  then  I started  to  translate  it.  Well,  it  so 
happened  that  there  was  some  mistake  in  the  message  that  had  to  be  corrected 
and  so  that  took  some  time.  That  was  at  1 2 : 30  or  perhaps  it  was  a little  before 
or  after  12:30;  whatever  time  it  was,  we  were  to  go  home.  It  being  Saturday, 
we  worked  until  noon.  I hadn’t  completed  it,  so  I worked  overtime  and 
finished  it,  and  1 would  say  that  between  1 : 30  and  2 was  when  I finished 
my  rough  draft  translation.”  Mrs.  Edgers  left  it  in  the  hands  of  Chief 
Yeoman  Bryant.  But  the  message  was  still  not  entirely  clear,  and  she  had 
not  yet  had  enough  experience  for  her  translations  to  be  sent  out  without 
further  checking.  Kramer,  busy  with  the  13  parts,  did  not  examine  it  in 
detail. 

To  speed  processing  of  the  13  parts,  gy,  learning  that  some  people  were  in 
S.I.S.,  sent  over  parts  1 and  2.  But  when  Major  Doud  of  S.l.S.  ordered  Miss 
Cave  to  op-20-g  to  help  in  the  smooth  typeups,  the  two  parts  were  returned 
to  gy  for  solution  there,  probably  because  of  the  garbles.  But  other  messages 
also  coming  in  were  retained  by  S.l.S. 

At  3 o’clock,  Kramer,  in  gz,  had  checked  with  gy  to  find  out  whether  any 
more  Tokyo  traffic  had  come  in  before  releasing  his  translators  for  the  day. 
Since  the  critical  matter  of  a diplomatic  note  is  often  found  in  the  last  sen- 
tences, gy  broke  down  the  last  part  intercepted  for  him.  The  first  part  of  the 
first  line  indicated  in  Japanese  that  this  was  part  8 of  a 14-part  message.  After 
about  three  lines  of  Japanese  text  in  the  preamble,  the  message  came  out  in 
English,  just  as  the  Foreign  Office  had  sent  it.  Kramer  could  let  his  translators 
go  home.  Interspersed  throughout  the  English  text  were  many  of  the  three- 
letter  codewords  indicating  punctuation,  paragraphing,  and  numbering,  but 
these  posed  no  problem  since  they  had  been  recovered  long  ago. 

At  4 o’clock,  when  Linn  took  over  the  gy  watch,  the  garbles  still  had  not 
been  cleared.  He  decided  to  start  from  the  very  beginning,  to  check  the  key, 
find  what  was  wrong,  and  redecrypt  the  messages  rather  than  to  try  to  guess 
at  the  garbled  letters  and  possibly  make  serious  errors  that  would  distort  the 
sense.  Discarding  all  the  previous  work  caused  a serious  jam  on  the  Navy’s 
one  purple  machine,  and  about  6 p.m.  gy  again  called  on  S.l.S.  for  help. 


One  Day  of  Magic  51 

Parts  9 and  10  were  sent  over;  an  hour  later,  the  decrypts  came  back  in  long- 
hand.  By  7:30,  the  last  of  the  13  parts  was  being  decrypted. 

Not  all  the  garbles  had  been  scrubbed  out.  Part  3 had  a 75-letter  smudge 
that  could  not  be  read  at  all,  Part  10  a 45-letter  blur,  and  Part  1 1 one  of  50 
letters.  Part  13  went  awry  in  two  patches.  One  deciphered  as  andnd  and  the 
other  as  chtualylokmmtf,  gy  thought  the  first  should  be  and  as  and  the  second

In  the  Japanese  embassy,  about  a mile  away,  the  code  clerks  had  com- 
pleted deciphering  the  first  seven  or  eight  parts  of  the  message  by  dinnertime. 
Then  they  all  repaired  to  the  Mayflower  Hotel  for  a farewell  dinner  for 
Hidenari  Terasaki,  head  of  Japanese  espionage  for  the  western  hemisphere, 
who  had  been  ordered  to  another  post. 

While  they  were  enjoying  themselves,  American  code  clerks  at  the 
Department  of  State  were  at  work  encoding  a personal  appeal  for  peace  from 
the  President  of  the  United  States  to  the  Emperor  of  Japan.  This  had  been  off 
again,  on  again  since  October,  Roosevelt  apparently  wishing  to  save  it  for  a 
last  resort.  Now  he  decided  that  the  time  had  come.  The  message  was  on  its 
way  by  9 o’clock.  It  traversed  the  7,000  miles  to  Tokyo  in  an  hour.  But  it  took 
ten  hours  to  get  from  the  Central  Telegraph  Office  to  the  American  embassy. 

As  the  President  was  addressing  a message  of  peace  to  the  Emperor,  the 
men  of  the  Japanese  strike  force  were  listening  to  a message  of  war.  Shortly 
before,  Admiral  Nagumo  had  topped  off  the  fuel  tanks  of  his  combat  ships 
for  the  final  dash.  His  crews  waved  farewell  to  the  slow-moving  tankers.  Now 
theofficers  read  a stirring  message  from  Yamamoto  toall  hands:  “The  moment 
has  arrived.  The  fate  of  the  empire  is  at  stake.  Let  every  man  do  his  best.” 
Banzais  rent  the  air.  Up  the  mast  of  Akagi  fluttered  the  very  flag  that  had 
flown  at  Japan’s  great  naval  victory  over  Russia  in  1905.  It  was  a moment  of 
great  emotion.  Nagumo  altered  course  to  due  south  and  bent  on  26  knots. 
Through  a mounting  sea,  the  battle  force  plunged  toward  its  target. 

Lovely,  peaceful,  that  target  lay  “open  unto  the  fields,  and  to  the  sky,” 
oblivious  to  the  onrushing  armada  of  destruction.  But  many  people  were 
seeking  clues  to  Japanese  intentions,  particularly  concerning  sabotage,  which 
was  regarded  as  a serious  threat.  Among  these  was  Robert  L.  Shivers,  special 
agent  in  charge  of  the  F.B.I.’s  Honolulu  office  and  the  man  who,  under 
authority  of  the  Attorney  General,  had  ordered  the  tap  on  the  overseas  phone 
that  picked  up  Mrs.  Mori’s  interview.  By  noon  he  had  received  a transcript  in 
English  of  the  call,  and  soon  after  4 p.m.  was  conferring  about  it  with  May- 
field  and  the  Army  assistant  g-2,  Lieutenant  Colonel  George  W.  Bicknell,  in

his  office  on  the  sixth  floor  of  the  Alexander  Young  Hotel  in  Honolulu. 
Mayfield  consulted  with  Lieutenant  Carr,  who  had  translated  the  Navy 
telephone  taps  and  who  happened  to  be  duty  officer  that  afternoon  at  the 
District  Intelligence  Office ; both  thought  that  Carr  should  listen  to  the  original 
recording  to  see  if  any  hidden  meaning  was  concealed  in  the  intonations. 
Shivers  said  he  would  have  it  by  10  the  following  morning.  Bicknell,  whose 
job  included  heading  the  Army’s  counterintelligence  in  Hawaii,  was  con- 
vinced that  the  hibiscus  and  poinsettias  smelled  of  espionage.  He  telephoned 
his  boss,  Colonel  Kendall  J.  Fielder,  the  g-2,  and  said  he  wanted  to  see  him 
and  General  Short  immediately  on  a matter  of  importance. 

They  were  both  on  their  way  to  dinner  at  Schofield  Barracks,  and  Fielder 
asked  if  it  couldn't  wait  until  tomorrow.  Bicknell  said  it  was  too  important; 
Fielder  agreed  to  see  him.  Bicknell  drove  hurriedly  out  to  Fort  Shafter,  where 
Fielder  and  Short  had  their  homes  side  by  side,  and  at  about  6 p.m.  the  three 
men  discussed  the  message  for  a while,  but  though  they  considered  it  “very 
suspicious,  very  fishy,”  Fielder  said,  “we  couldn  t solve  it,  we  couldn  t make 
heads  nor  tails  out  of  it.”  The  flower  references  seemed  totally  out  of  place, 
as  if  they  were  indeed  conveying  secret  military  information  by  open  code, 
but,  on  the  other  hand,  the  Japanese  spoke  quite  openly  about  airplanes  and 
the  fleet.  The  whole  thing  was  very  baffling,  and  they  never  did  reach  a 
conclusion  about  it. 

They  did  not  know  that  the  Yomiuri  Shimbun  was  then  being  hawked  on 
the  streets  of  Tokyo  with  an  atmosphere  feature  on  Hawaii  based  on  the  Mori 
interview — complete  with  reference  to  flowers.  Nor,  apparently,  did  they 
realize  that  the  Japanese  did  not  need  so  weak  and  dangerous  a system.  They 
could  send  much  more  detailed  reports  by  cable  in  their  diplomatic  code. 
And,  in  one  of  the  most  ironical  of  situations  at  Pearl  Harbor,  they  were  doing 
precisely  that  at  that  very  minute.  While  the  three  American  army  officers 
were  standing  on  Short’s  porch  worrying  about  the  hibiscus,  the  R.C.A. 
office  was  time-stamping  “1941  Dec  6 pm  6 01”  on  a message  from  the  con- 
sulate. It  was  signed  “Kita”  but  it  came  from  Yoshikawa.  It  was  brief  (only 
44  groups)  and  cheap  ($6.82),  but  it  reported  that  “(1)  On  the  evening  of  the 
5th,  the  battleship  Wyoming  and  one  sweeper  entered  port.  Ships  at  anchor 
on  the  6th  were:  9 battleships,  3 minesweepers,  3 light  cruisers,  17  destroyers. 
Ships  in  dock  were:  4 light  cruisers,  2 destroyers.  Heavy  cruisers  and  carriers 
have  all  left.  (2)  It  appears  that  no  air  reconnaissance  is  being  conducted  by 
the  fleet  air  arm.”  Yoshikawa  was,  as  usual,  partly  right  and  partly  wrong. 
He  mistook  Utah  for  Wyoming.  His  figure  on  the  battleships  was  correct,  but 
in  harbor  that  afternoon  were  6 light  and  2 heavy  cruisers,  29  destroyers,  4 
minesweepers,  8 minelayers,  and  3 seaplane  tenders.  With  this  message 
Yoshikawa  completed  his  assignment.  It  was  the  last  cable  sent  by  the 
Japanese  consulate  in  Hawaii  for  many  years. 

By  8 : 45  p.m.  in  Washington,  the  1 3 parts  had  been  typed  in  smooth  copies

and  put  up  in  folders.  Kramer  began  telephoning  the  recipients  to  find  out 
where  they  were  so  he  could  bring  the  magic  to  them.  He  also  called  his  wife, 
Mary,  who  agreed  to  chauffeur  him  during  his  deliveries.  They  reached  the 
White  House  first,  at  about  9:15.  The  naval  aide,  Beardall,  had  told  the 
President  that  some  magic  would  be  delivered  that  evening,  and  at  about  4

On  the  eve  of  Pearl  Harbor , Takeo  Yoshikawa  sends  his  final  message  over  Consul 
Kita’s  signature,  using  the  pa-k2  code,  to  report  that  the  U.S.  fleet  is  still  in  port 

p.m.  he  had  ordered  his  communications  assistant,  Lieutenant  Lester  R. 
Schulz,  to  stand  by  and  bring  it  to  the  President.  Schulz  was  waiting  in 
Beardall  s small  office  in  the  corner  of  the  basement  mail  room  in  the  White 
House  when  Kramer  arrived.  The  Roosevelts  had  been  entertaining  at  a large 
dinner  party,  but  the  President  had  excused  himself.  Schulz  obtained  permis- 
sion to  bring  the  magic  to  the  President,  and  an  usher  accompam’ed  him  to 


54 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  oval  study  on  the  second  floor  and  announced  him.  Roosevelt  was  seated 
at  his  desk.  Only  Harry  Hopkins  was  with  him.  Schulz  unlocked  the  briefcase 
with  the  key  that  Beardall  had  given  him,  removed  the  sheaf  of  magic,  and 
handed  it  to  the  President.  He  read  the  13  parts  in  about  ten  minutes  while 
Hopkins  paced  slowly  up  and  down.  Then  Hopkins  read  them.  The  13th  part 
rejected  Hull’s  offer,  and  when  Hopkins  had  passed  the  papers  back  to  the 
President,  Roosevelt  turned  to  him  and  said,  in  effect,  This  means  war. 
Hopkins  agreed,  and  for  about  five  minutes  they  discussed  the  situation,  the 
deployment  of  Japanese  forces,  the  movement  towards  Indochina,  and  similar 
matters.  The  President  mentioned  his  message  to  Hirohito.  Hopkins  remarked 
that  it  was  too  bad  that  the  United  States  could  not  strike  the  first  blow  and 
prevent  any  kind  of  surprise  in  the  inevitable  war. 

“No,”  the  President  said  in  effect,  “we  can  t do  that.  We  are  a democracy 
and  a peaceful  people.”  He  raised  his  voice:  “But  we  have  a good  record.” 
He  tried  unsuccessfully  to  get  Admiral  Stark  on  the  telephone,  deciding 
against  having  him  paged  at  the  National  Theater  for  fear  of  causing  undue 
alarm. 

The  President  then  returned  the  papers  to  Schulz  and,  about  half  an  hour 
after  he  had  entered  the  study,  Schulz  left.  He  found  Kramer  seated  at  one  of 
the  long  tables  in  the  mail  room.  Schulz  gave  him  the  pouch  and  soon  there- 
after went  home.  Kramer,  however,  continued  to  the  Wardman  Park  Hotel, 
where  Secretary  Knox  had  a suite.  For  about  twenty  minutes,  while  Kramer 
chatted  with  Mrs.  Knox  and  the  acting  manager  of  Knox’s  Chicago  Daily 
News,  the  Secretary  read  the  13  parts.  He  agreed  with  Kramer  that,  even 
incomplete,  it  pointed  to  a termination  of  negotiations.  He  went  into  another 
room  to  make  some  telephone  calls,  and  when  he  came  out  he  told  Kramer  to 
bring  the  latest  magic  to  a meeting  that  had  been  arranged  for  10  a.m.  the 
next  morning  with  Stimson  and  Hull  in  the  State  Department.  (Bratton  had 
delivered  the  13  parts  to  the  night  duty  officer  at  State  at  10  p.m.,  admonishing 
him  to  get  them  to  Hull  at  once.)  Knox  returned  the  intercepts  to  Kramer,  who 
then  went  to  the  home  of  Rear  Admiral  Theodore  S.  Wilkinson,  director  of 
naval  intelligence,  where  Beardall  and  Army  intelligence  chief  Miles  happened 
to  be  dinner  guests.  All  three  studied  the  intercept  in  a room  away  from  the 
other  guests,  Beardall  reading  from  an  extra  copy  that  Kramer  had.  They  too 
seemed  to  feel  that  negotiations  were  coming  to  an  end. 

It  was  after  midnight  when  Kramer  left  the  Wilkinson  house.  His  wife 
drove  him  back  to  the  Navy  Department,  where  he  put  the  magic  back  in  his 
safe  in  gz  and  checked  to  see  if  the  14th  part  had  yet  come  in.  It  had  not. 
Finally  he  went  home  himself. 

In  S I.S.,  meanwhile,  the  new  teletype  that  would  expedite  the  forwarding 
of  intercepts  was  being  set  up  in  the  “cage,”  the  barred  room  where  purple 
traffic  was  processed.  Monitor  Post  2 was  requested  to  send  in  some  intercepts 
as  a test.  In  San  Francisco,  Harold  W.  Martin,  the  noncom  in  charge, 
punched  onto  the  teletype  tape  the  intercepts  that  the  post  had  picked  up  since 


55 


One  Day  of  Magic 

airmailing  in  the  bulk  of  the  day’s  material,  as  well  as  the  earlier  ones. 
Among  the  later  ones  was  Yoshikawa’s  final  message,  which  thus  became  one 
of  the  first  to  move  on  the  direct  wire  as  a real,  nontest  item.  S.I.S.  received 
it  a little  after  midnight.  But  pa-k2  was  a low-priority  system,  and  the 
message  had  originated  in  a consular  office.  It  was  set  aside  to  be  worked  on 
later. 

Besides,  S.I.S.  had  more  important  things  to  worry  about.  Like  op-20-g,  it 
was  going  frantic  in  a search  for  the  14th  part.  Captain  Robert  E.  Schukraft, 
head  of  the  intercept  section,  and  Frank  B.  Rowlett,  the  civilian  cryptanalyst 
in  charge  of  the  Japanese  diplomatic  solutions,  checked  and  rechecked  to  see 
whether  one  of  the  stations  had  picked  it  up  and  had  somehow  neglected  to 
forward  it.  The  message  preambles  had  said  that  it  existed,  but  they  could 
find  no  trace  of  it.  Neither  suspected  that  the  Japanese  Foreign  Office  had 
deliberately  held  up  transmission  of  this  final  conclusive  part  for  security’s 
sake. 

Neither  did  the  code  clerks  at  the  Japanese  embassy.  They  had  returned 
from  Terasaki’s  party  about  9:30,  and  by  midnight  had  completed  decipher- 
ing of  the  13  parts.  While  they  waited  for  the  final  section,  they  busied  them- 
selves by  disposing  of  the  remnants  of  the  cipher  machine  they  had  destroyed 
the  night  before.  But  they  did  nothing  to  fulfill  the  orders  of  the  pilot  message 
to  prepare  the  dispatch  for  immediate  presentation. 

Finally,  fourteen  hours  after  the  last  part  of  the  previous  13  parts  had 
been  transmitted,  the  Foreign  Office  released  the  crucial  14th  part  that  broke 
off  negotiations.  At  4 p.m.,  Tokyo  time,  it  ordered  it  transmitted  via  both 
R.C.A.  and  Mackay  Radio  & Telegraph  Company  to  ensure  its  correct 
reception.  An  hour  and  a half  later,  it  wired  to  the  Central  Telegraph  Office 
the  coded  message  ordering  the  1 p.m.  delivery  of  the  14-part  note.  This  too 
was  sent  via  the  two  companies. 

As  usual,  the  indefatigable  ear  of  Bainbridge  Island  detected  the  ethereal 
pulses  of  both  messages.  It  picked  up  the  Mackay  transmission  of  the  14th 
part  between  12:05  and  12:10  a.m.,  December  7,  local  time,  and  the  even 
briefer  one  o’clock  message  between  1 :28  and  1:37  a.m.  It  teletyped  them  to 
gy  in  a single  transmission,  the  14th  part  as  serial  No.  380  of  Station  S,  the 
one  o’clock  as  No.  381.  Brotherhood,  who  was  gy  watch  officer,  ran  them 
through  the  purple  machine.  He  evidently  had  some  trouble  with  the  14th 
part,  for  it  took  an  hour  to  break.  But  by  4 a.m.  he  had  it  in  English.  The 
three-letter  codegroups  were  quickly  translated  into  punctuation;  the  message 
would  need  little  more  than  typing.  The  one  o’clock  message,  however,  turned 
out  to  be  in  Japanese.  He  sent  it  to  S.I.S.  for  translation,  knowing  that  trans- 
lators were  on  duty  because  S.I.S.  was  beginning  its  round-the-clock  tours.  It 
was  a little  past  5 a.m.,  Washington  time. 

In  the  embassy  of  Nippon,  the  code  clerks  who  had  waited  all  through  the 
night  for  the  14th  part  were,  on  Counselor  fguchi’s  advice,  being  sent  home. 
Just  as  they  were  climbing  wearily  into  their  beds,  the  naval  attache  arrived 


56 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


and  found  the  mailbox  stuffed  with  cablegrams.  The  duty  officer  telephoned 
the  clerks  at  their  homes  about  8 a.m.  and  ordered  them  back  to  work. 

A few  hundred  miles  north  of  Oahu,  the  Japanese  task  force,  bristling  with 
guns,  planes,  and  hate  for  Americans,  bore  down  on  the  Pacific  Fleet.  A few 
hours  earlier,  a message  had  arrived  from  Tokyo  that  caused  Commander 
Mitsuo  Fuchida,  the  pilot  who  was  to  head  the  first  wave  of  the  air  attack,  to 
breathe  a sigh  of  relief.  It  had  been  relayed  from  Yoshikawa,  and  it  reported 
that  no  barrage  balloons  had  yet  been  emplaced  to  protect  the  fleet  from  air 
attack.  The  same  message  also  caused  Commander  Minoru  Genda  to  sigh 
with  relief.  It  stated  that  the  battleships  appeared  not  to  be  protected  by 
torpedo  nets.  Genda  had  conceived  the  plan  of  shallow-water  torpedo  attack 
on  the  anchored  American  ships. 

A little  more  than  an  hour  after  the  hands  of  Honolulu  clocks  had  snipped 
off  December  6 and  opened  out  into  the  first  hours  of  December  7,  the  Pearl 
Harbor  strike  force  received  Tokyo’s  relay  of  Yoshikawa  s final  message.  The 
American  ships  were  still  in  harbor,  awaiting  the  ax  stroke  with  fat  com- 
placency. They  were  apparently  not  even  protected  by  air  search.  Was  it  all  a 
decoy?  The  strike  force’s  radio  officer,  Commander  Kanjiro  Ono,  listened 
intently  to  Honolulu’s  radio  station  kgmb  for  any  inkling  that  the  Americans 
knew  of  them.  He  heard  only  the  soft  melodies  of  the  islands.  On  Hiryu,  the 
flight  deck  officer  slipped  bits  of  paper  between  each  plane’s  radio  transmitter 
key  and  its  contact  point  to  make  sure  that  radio  silence,  so  carefully  pre- 
served for  almost  two  weeks,  would  not  be  accidentally  broken  in  the  last 
few  hours  to  destroy  the  element  of  surprise. 

As  Yoshikawa’s  final  report  was  being  decoded  aboard  Akagi,  Kramer 
returned  to  the  Navy  Department  he  had  left  only  seven  hours  before,  and 
began  working  again.  It  was  7:30  on  the  morning  of  Sunday,  December  7. 

Brotherhood’s  decryptment  of  the  14th  part  was  on  his  desk  when  he 
arrived.  It  took  him  about  half  an  hour  to  ready  a smooth  version,  and  at  8 
o’clock  he  delivered  the  neatly  typed  copy  to  McCollum.  Other  copies  went 
to  S.I.S.  for  its  distribution.  Kramer  then  worked  on  other  traffic  in  his  office, 
interrupting  himself  only  once,  at  8:45,  to  bring  a copy  of  the  14th  part  to 
naval  intelligence  chief  Wilkinson  on  his  arrival  at  the  Navy  Department.  At 
9:30  he  set  out  to  deliver  the  full  14  parts  to  the  meeting  of  the  three  secre- 
taries. He  stopped  at  the  office  of  the  Chief  of  Naval  Operations  to  make  sure 
that  Stark  had  been  given  the  message,  which  he  had,  and  then  walked  and 
trotted  to  the  White  House.  He  got  there  at  about  9:45  and  gave  the  magic 
pouch  to  Beardall,  who  had  assigned  himself  to  duty  that  morning  because  he 
thought  the  14th  part  of  the  message  that  he  had  seen  at  Wilkinson’s  house 
the  night  before  might  be  coming  in. 

Beardall  brought  the  folder  to  the  President,  who  was  in  his  bedroom. 
Roosevelt  said  good  morning  to  him,  read  the  intercept,  and  commented  that 


57 


One  Day  of  Magic 

it  looked  like  the  Japanese  were  going  to  break  off  negotiations.  Then  he 
returned  the  magic,  and  Beardall  took  it  back  to  the  Navy  Department. 

Kramer,  meanwhile,  had  hurried  across  the  west  lawn  of  the  White  House 
to  the  ugly,  ornate  State  Department  building,  arriving  at  about  ten  minutes 
of  10.  The  Army  courier  appeared  at  almost  the  same  moment  with  the 
magic  for  Hull  and  Stimson.  Three  State  Department  officials  who  saw 
magic — Hornbeck,  Ballantine,  and  Hamilton— were  shown  the  14th  part  by 
Hull’s  aide,  John  Stone,  and  the  group  discussed  the  situation  in  general 
terms  until  the  secretaries  arrived  a few  minutes  later.  Kramer  gave  his  pouch 
to  Knox  and  headed  back  to  the  Navy  Department. 

Meanwhile,  the  translation  of  the  one  o’clock  message  had  come  up  from 
S.I.S.  It  was  placed  in  Bratton’s  hands  about  9 a.m.  while  he  was  reading  the 
14th  part.  It  “immediately  stunned  me  into  frenzied  activity  because  of  its 
implications,  and  from  that  time  on  I was  busily  engaged  trying  to  locate 
various  officers  of  the  general  staff  and  conferring  with  them  on  the  exclusive 
subject  of  this  message  and  its  meaning,”  he  said  later.  He  tried  first  to  get  in 
touch  with  Marshall,  calling  him  at  his  quarters  at  Fort  Myer,  and  was  told 
by  an  orderly  that  the  chief  of  staff  had  gone  on  his  customary  Sunday  morn- 
ing horseback  ride.  Bratton  directed  the  orderly: 

“Please  go  out  at  once,  get  assistance  if  necessary,  and  find  General 
Marshall,  ask  him  to — tell  him  who  I am  and  tell  him  to  go  to  the  nearest 
telephone,  that  it  is  vitally  important  that  I communicate  with  him  at  the 
earliest  practicable  moment.”  The  orderly  said  he  would.  Bratton  called 
Miles,  told  him  of  the  message,  and  urged  him  to  come  down  to  the  office  at 
once.  Between  10  and  10:30,  Marshall  called  Bratton  back.  The  colonel 
offered  to  drive  out  at  once  with  the  one  o’clock  message,  but  Marshall  told 
him  not  to  bother,  that  he  was  coming  down  to  his  office  at  once.  Bratton 
obeyed. 

Kramer  arrived  back  in  gz  at  about  10:20,  and  found  there  the  one  o’clock 
message.  It  struck  him  as  forcibly  as  it  had  Bratton.  He  at  once  had  Yeoman 
Bryant  prepare  a new  set  of  folders  for  immediate  delivery  of  the  intercept. 
Included  in  the  new  set  were  other  messages  which  S.I.S.  had  decrypted,  and 
on  which  Kramer  had  been  working  earlier  in  the  morning:  Tokyo  serial  No. 
904,  which  directed  the  ambassadors  not  to  use  an  ordinary  clerk  in  preparing 
the  14-part  ultimatum  for  presentation  to  the  Secretary  of  State,  so  as  to 
preserve  maximum  security;  serial  No.  909,  thanking  the  two  ambassadors 
for  all  their  efforts;  and  serial  No.  910,  ordering  destruction  of  the  remaining 
cipher  machine  and  all  machine  codes. 

Kramer  was  about  to  dart  out  again  when  Pering,  the  gy  watch  officer, 
brought  in  a message  in  plain-language  Japanese,  ending  with  the  telltale 
stop  that  indicated  it  was  an  ingo  denpo  message:  koyanagi  rijiyori 

SEIRINOTUGOO  ARUN1TUKI  HATTORI  MINAMI  KINEBUNKO  SETURITU  KIKINO 

kyokaingaku  sikyuu  denpoo  aritasi  stop  Togo.  Kramer  recognized 
koyanagi  as  the  codeword  for  England , and  hattori  as  a codeword  whose 


58 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


meaning  he  did  not  recall.  He  consulted  his  code  list  and  saw  that  it  meant 
Relations  between  Japan  and  ( name  of  country)  are  not  in  accordance  with 
expectation.  But  in  his  haste  he  overlooked  that  the  common  Japanese  word 
minami,  which  means  “south,”  had  an  ingo  denpo  meaning  of  U.S.A.  He 
interpreted  the  message  as  “Please  have  director  Koyagani  send  a wire  stating 
the  sum  which  has  been  decided  to  be  spent  on  the  South  Hattori  Memorial 
Library  in  order  that  this  business  may  be  wound  up.”  Consequently,  he 
dictated  a decode  that  omitted  United  States : Relations  between  Japan  and 
England  are  not  in  accordance  with  expectation.  Yeoman  Bryant  inserted  this 
and  three  other  minor  messages  that  had  come  over  from  the  Army  into  the 
folders.  Kramer  meanwhile  made  a navigator’s  time  circle  that  indicated  that 
one  o’clock  in  Washington  was  dawn  in  Hawaii  and  the  very  early  hours  of 
the  morning  in  the  Far  East  around  Singapore  and  the  Philippines,  which 
everybody  seemed  to  be  watching.  He  shoved  the  folders  into  the  briefcase 
and  dashed  out  the  door. 

He  went  first  to  Stark’s  office,  where  the  officers  were  discussing  the  14th 
part,  summoned  McCollum,  gave  him  the  pouch  that  included  the  final  code- 
destruction and  one  o’clock  messages,  and  mentioned  to  him  the  significance 
of  the  latter’s  timing.  McCollum  grasped  it  at  once  and  disappeared  into 
Stark’s  office.  Kramer  wheeled  and  hurried  down  the  passageway.  He  emerged 
from  the  Navy  Department  building  and  turned  right  on  Constitution  Avenue, 
heading  for  the  meeting  in  the  State  Department  eight  or  ten  blocks  away. 
The  urgency  of  the  situation  washed  over  him  again,  and  he  began  to  move 
on  the  double. 

He  half  trotted,  half  walked  to  State,  getting  there  at  about  10:45.  Hull, 
Knox,  and  Stimson  were  still  meeting.  Kramer  saw  them  grouped  around  the 
conference  table  when  the  door  to  Hull’s  office  was  opened  briefly.  He  gave 
the  magic  messages  to  Stone,  explaining  to  him  how  the  one  o’clock  time  of 
delivery  of  the  ultimatum  tied  in  with  the  movement  of  a big  Japanese  convoy 
down  the  coast  of  Indochina,  and  mentioning  in  passing  that  the  time  in 
Hawaii  would  be  7:30  a.m.  The  final  code-destruction  message  was  self- 
explanatory.  Kramer  carried  a magic  pouch  to  the  White  House,  and  then 
returned,  perspiring,  to  the  Navy  Department,  to  busy  himself  with  still 
more  magic.  At  about  12:30,  he  spotted  the  omission  of  United  States  from 
the  ingo  denpo  message.  Because  the  one  o’clock  meeting  was  so  close,  he 
telephoned  the  recipients  with  the  correction,  a practice  he  had  followed 
several  times  in  the  past,  but  reached  only  McCollum  and  Bratton.  He  told 
them  that  United  States  was  to  be  inserted  in  file  number  7148.  The  force  of  it 
had  been  considerably  lessened  by  the  one  o’clock  message,  but  Kramer, 
conscientious  beyond  the  basic  requirements  of  duty,  nevertheless  planned  to 
send  around  a corrected  version. 

Safford  later  estimated  that  op-20-g  handled  three  times  as  much  material 
that  weekend  as  on  a normal  one;  the  gy  log  shows  at  least  28  messages  in 
purple  alone  handled  that  Sunday.  And  these  messages  were  processed 


59 


One  Day  of  Magic 

much  more  expeditiously  than  at  any  other  time  in  the  past,  Kramer  said. 
The  cryptanalysts  had  done  their  duty,  and  had  done  it  superbly.  Events 
now  passed  out  of  their  hands. 

In  Tokyo,  the  President’s  message  to  the  Emperor  had  finally  been 
delivered  to  Grew  after  a delay  of  ten  hours.  The  chief  of  the  censorship  office 
had  ordered  that  all  foreign  cables  be  held  up  for  five  hours  one  day  and  ten 
hours  the  next.  The  order  had  been  issued  at  the  request  of  a lieutenant 
colonel  on  the  general  staff,  who  asked  that  this  be  done  “as  a precaution.” 
The  President’s  “triple  priority”  message  arrived  on  one  of  the  ten-hour  days, 
was  stalled  for  the  required  time,  and  was  finally  delivered  at  10:30  p.m., 
Tokyo  time. 

Grew  immediately  arranged  for  a meeting  with  Togo  and,  when  the 
message  had  been  decoded,  drove  to  Togo’s  official  residence  at  12:15  a.m. 
He  requested — as  is  the  right  of  all  ambassadors — an  audience  with  the  head 
of  state  to  present  the  message,  then  read  it  aloud  to  Togo  and  gave  him  a 
copy.  Togo  promised  to  present  the  matter  to  the  Throne  and,  despite  the 
lateness  of  the  hour,  telephoned  the  Lord  Keeper  of  the  Privy  Seal  for  an 
audience.  Ministers  of  state  would  be  received  at  any  hour,  and  the  audience 
was  arranged  for  3 a.m.  Togo  began  having  the  message  translated. 

It  was  then  about  5:30  a.m.,  December  7,  in  Hawaii.  The  Japanese  task 
force  was  only  250  miles  north  of  Pearl  Harbor.  More  than  2,000  Americans 
with  less  than  three  hours  to  live  slept  or  played  in  blissful  ignorance  of  that 
fact.  The  hands  of  clocks  in  the  Foreign  Office  in  Tokyo,  in  the  code  room  at 
the  Japanese  embassy  in  Washington,  in  the  War  and  Navy  departments,  in 
Pearl  Harbor,  circled  around  and  around,  but  not  so  quickly  as  the  spinning 
propellers  of  Nagumo’s  ships.  At  5:30,  two  cruisers  catapulted  off  a pair  of 
scout  planes  to  make  sure  the  Americans  were  still  there. 

The  clerks  at  the  embassy  had  straggled  back  to  work  between  9:30  and 
10.  They  began  decoding  the  longer  cables  first,  as  experience  had  shown  that 
these  were  usually  the  more  important.  At  the  same  time,  the  embassy’s  first 
secretary,  Katzuso  Okumura,  was  typing  up  the  first  13  parts  of  the  ulti- 
matum. He  had  been  chosen  because  the  Foreign  Office  had  forbidden  the  use 
of  an  ordinary  typist  in  the  interests  of  secrecy  and  he  was  the  only  senior 
official  who  could  operate  a typewriter  at  all  decently.  At  about  11:30,  code 
clerk  Juichi  Yoshida  adjusted  the  Alphabetical  Typewriter  to  the  proper  keys 
and  typed  out  a short  code  message.  To  the  consternation  of  the  entire  staff, 
it  turned  out  to  be  an  instruction  to  deliver  the  14-part  message  to  Secretary 
Hull  at  1 p.m.,  Washington  time.  The  14th  part  had  not  even  been  decoded 
from  the  sheaf  of  incoming  cables!  And  only  one  code  machine  was  left  to 
decipher  all  the  messages! 

A few  blocks  away.  General  Marshall  had  just  arrived  at  the  War  Depart- 
ment. On  his  desk  was  the  magic  folder  with  the  14-part  message  on  top  and 


60 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  one  o’clock  message  under  it.  He  began  to  read  the  ultimatum  carefully, 
some  parts  several  times.  Bratton  and  Brigadier  General  Leonard  T.  Gerow, 
the  war  plans  chief,  tried  to  get  him  to  look  at  the  one  o clock  message,  but  it 
is  rather  difficult  for  subordinates  to  interrupt  a four-star  general,  and  he 
finished  the  ultimatum  before  finding  the  time-of-delivery  message.  It  struck 
him  with  the  same  sense  of  urgency  that  it  had  the  others,  and  he  picked  up 
the  telephone  to  call  Stark  to  see  if  he  wanted  to  join  him  in  sending  a warning 
message  to  American  forces  in  the  Pacific. 

At  approximately  the  same  time,  Ambassador  Nomura  was  calling  Hull  to 
request  an  appointment  at  1 p.m.  And  230  miles  north  of  Hawaii,  the  first 
wave  of  Japanese  planes  was  thundering  off  the  flight  decks  of  the  carriers. 

Stark  was  at  that  moment  discussing  the  significance  of  the  one  o clock 
message  with  Captain  R.  E.  Schuirman,  Navy’s  liaison  with  State.  He  told 
Marshall  that  he  felt  that  enough  warnings  had  been  sent  and  that  more  would 
just  confuse  the  commanders.  Marshall  thereupon  wrote  out  the  dispatch  he 
wanted  sent : 

Japanese  are  presenting  at  one  p.m.  Eastern  Standard  Time  today  what 
amounts  to  an  ultimatum  also  they  are  under  orders  to  destroy  their  code 
machine  immediately  Stop  Just  what  significance  the  hour  set  may  have  we  do 
not  know  but  be  on  alert  accordingly  Stop 

On  his  desk  Marshall  had  a scrambler  telephone  with  which  he  could  have 
called  Short  in  Hawaii.  The  scrambling  apparatus  stood  in  a room  next  to  his 
office,  thus  obviating  the  possibility  of  tapping  the  conversation  in  un- 
scrambled form,  as  was  done  with  the  Mori  message.  But  Marshall  knew  that 
scramblers  afforded  protection  merely  against  casual  listeners;  they  could  be 
penetrated  by  a determined  eavesdropper  with  proper  equipment.  He  had  on 
several  occasions  warned  the  President  about  security  on  his  transatlantic 
telephone  conversations  with  Ambassador  Bullitt  in  France  and  later  with 
Churchill — a wise  move,  for,  though  he  did  not  know  it,  the  Nazis  had  already 
penetrated  that  scrambler.  The  Japanese  had  evidenced  some  interest  in  the 
San  Francisco-Honolulu  scrambler,  and  Marshall  was  acutely  sensitive  “that 
the  Japanese  would  have  grasped  at  most  any  straw”  to  suggest  to  the  isola- 
tionists that  the  administration  had  committed  an  overt  act  that  had  forced 
the  Japanese  hand.  Japanese  interception  of  a scrambler  warning  might  thus 
have  sent  the  country  to  war  divided.  So  Marshall  shunned  the  scrambler 
telephone  and  relied  on  the  slightly  slower  but  much  more  secure  method  of 
enciphering  a written  message. 

As  he  was  completing  the  message,  Stark  called  him  back.  He  had  re- 
considered and  wanted  Marshall  to  add  the  usual  admonition  to  show  the 
message  to  the  naval  opposites.  Marshall  added:  “Inform  naval  authorities 
of  this  communication.”  Stark  offered  the  Navy  communication  facilities, 
but  Marshall  said  that  the  Army’s  could  get  the  message  out  as  quickly. 

Marshall  gave  the  message  to  Bratton  to  take  it  to  the  War  Department 


61 


One  Day  of  Magic 

message  center  for  transmission  to  the  commanding  generals  in  the  Philip- 
pines, Hawaii,  the  Caribbean,  and  West  Coast,  after  vetoing  a suggestion  that 
it  be  typed  first.  As  Bratton  was  leaving,  Gerow  called  out  that  if  there  was 
any  question  as  to  priority,  to  send  it  to  the  Philippines  first.  Bratton,  greatly 
agitated,  gave  the  message  to  Colonel  Edward  French  in  the  message  center 
and  asked  how  long  it  would  take  to  get  it  out.  French  told  him  that  it  would 
be  encoded  in  three  minutes,  on  the  air  in  eight,  and  in  the  hands  of  the 
addressees  in  twenty.  Bratton  returned  and  reported  to  Marshall,  who  did  not 
understand  the  explanation  and  sent  him  back  for  a clarification.  He  still  was 
not  sure  and  sent  Bratton  back  a third  time,  after  which  he  was  finally 
satisfied  with  the  answer. 

Meanwhile,  French  had  had  the  message  typed  anyway  and  then  ordered 
it  encoded  on  a machine  that  was  operated  from  a typewriter  keyboard. 
During  the  few  minutes  that  this  took,  he  checked  his  Honolulu  circuit,  and 
found  that  since  early  morning  interference  had  been  so  bad  that  the  small  10- 
kilowatt  War  Department  radio  could  not  “bust”  through  it.  He  knew  that 
R.C.A.  in  San  Francisco  had  a 40-kilowatt  transmitter  which  would  have  no 
difficulty  in  getting  through,  and  that  Western  Union  in  San  Francisco  had  a 
tube  running  across  the  street  from  its  office  to  this  R.C.A.  office.  He  had  also 
learned  on  the  previous  day  that  R.C.A.  was  installing  a teletype  circuit  from 
its  office  in  Honolulu  to  Short’s  headquarters  at  Fort  Shatter.  French 
figured  that  this  would  therefore  be  his  most  expeditious  route;  after  the 
message  had  been  encoded,  he  personally  carried  it  over  to  his  bank  of  six 
Western  Union  teletypes  and,  at  12:01  p.m.  December  7,  sent  it  on  its  way. 
Western  Union  forwarded  it  at  12: 17,  and  46  minutes  later  it  was  received  by 
R.C.A.  in  Honolulu.  Local  time  was  7:33  a.m.  The  first  wave  of  Japanese 
planes  was  then  only  37  miles  away— so  close  that  the  Army  radar  operators 
at  Opana  Point,  who  had  tracked  the  flight  for  several  hours  and  had  been  told 
to  “Forget  it”  when  they  first  reported  it,  were  about  to  lose  it  in  the  dead  zone 
of  the  nearby  hills.  But  though  the  teletype  connection  for  Fort  Shafter  had 
been  completed  the  day  before,  it  was  not  in  operation  pending  tests  on 
Monday.  R.C.A.  put  Marshall's  message  in  an  envelope  marked  “Com- 
manding General”  for  hand  delivery. 

In  Tokyo,  Togo  had  been  received  by  the  Emperor.  He  read  the  text  of 
Roosevelt’s  message,  then  a draft  of  the  imperial  reply  that  he  and  Tojo  had 
prepared.  It  stated  that  the  14-part  note  was  to  be  considered  as  Japan's 
response.  Hirohito  assented,  and  at  3: 15  a.m.  Togo  withdrew  from  the  Divine 
Presence.  Deeply  moved,  he  recalled,  “I  passed  solemnly,  guided  by  a Court 
official,  down  several  hundred  yards  of  corridors,  stretching  serene  and 
tranquil.  Emerging  at  the  carriage  entrance  of  the  Sakashita  Gate,  I gazed  up 
at  the  brightly  shining  stars,  and  felt  bathed  in  a sacred  spirit.  Through  the 
Palace  plaza  in  utter  silence,  hearing  no  sound  of  the  sleeping  capital  but  only 
the  crunching  of  the  gravel  beneath  the  wheels  of  my  car,  I pondered  that  in  a 


62 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


few  short  hours  would  dawn  one  of  the  eventful  days  of  the  history  of  the 
world.”  Even  as  he  pondered,  Japanese  planes  were  circling  over  Pearl 
Harbor. 

In  stark  contrast  to  the  calm  stillness  of  Tokyo  was  the  hectic  bustle  of 
the  Japanese  embassy  on  Massachusetts  Avenue. 

Soon  after  the  one  o’clock  message  had  been  decoded,  Okumura  finished 
typing  the  first  13  parts.  But  he  decided  that  this  rough  draft  did  not  suit  the 
formality  of  a document  to  be  delivered  to  the  Secretary  of  State.  He  began 
retyping  it  from  the  very  beginning,  being  assisted  now  by  a junior  interpreter, 
Enseki.  His  task  was  complicated  by  two  messages  sent  up  from  the  code 
room,  one  ordering  the  insertion  of  a sentence  that  had  been  accidentally 
dropped,  one  changing  a word.  This  required  the  retyping  of  several  pages, 
including  one  just  completed  with  a great  deal  of  trouble.  At  about  12:30,  the 
code  room  finally  gave  him  the  14th  part  of  the  ultimatum,  but  Okumura  was 
nowhere  near  finished  with  the  first  13.  Nomura  kept  poking  his  head  in  the 
door  to  hurry  him  on.  A few  minutes  after  one,  when  it  was  evident  that  the 
document  would  not  be  finished  for  some  time,  the  Japanese  called  Hull  to 
request  a postponement  to  1:45,  saying  that  the  document  they  wished  to 
present  was  not  yet  ready.  Hull  acquiesced. 

At  almost  exactly  the  time  that  the  call  to  Hull  was  being  placed,  Com- 
mander Fuchida  and  his  flight  of  51  dive  bombers,  49  high-level  bombers,  40 
torpedo  planes,  and  43  fighters  arrived  over  Pearl  Harbor.  He  fired  a “black 
dragon”  from  his  signal  pistol  to  indicate  that  the  squadrons  should  deploy 
in  the  assault  pattern  for  complete  surprise.  Nine  minutes  later,  he  wirelessed 
the  message  “To,  to,  to”— the  first  syllable  of  the  Japanese  word  for  “Charge !” 
and  the  signal  to  attack.  As  the  planes  moved  into  position  for  their  runs,  he 
felt  so  certain  that  he  had  achieved  complete  surprise  that,  at  7 : 53,  two  minutes 
before  the  first  bomb  even  fell,  he  jubilantly  radioed  “tora!  tora!  tora!” 
(“Tiger!  Tiger!  Tiger!”) — the  prearranged  codeword  that  indicated  surprise. 
On  Akagi,  Nagumo  turned  to  a brother  officer  and  grasped  his  hand  in  a long, 
silent  handshake.  At  7:55,  the  first  bomb  exploded  at  the  foot  of  the  seaplane 
ramp  at  the  southern  end  of  Ford  Island  in  the  middle  of  Pearl  Harbor. 

Okumura  was  still  typing.  His  fingers  struggled  with  the  keys  as  torpedoes 
capsized  Oklahoma,  as  bombs  sank  West  Virginia,  as  1,000  men  died  in  the 
searing  inferno  of  Arizona.  At  1:50  p.m.  Washington  time,  25  minutes  after 
the  attack  had  started,  he  reached  the  end  of  his  typing  marathon.  The  two 
ambassadors,  who  were  waiting  in  the  vestibule,  started  for  the  State  Depart- 
ment as  soon  as  it  was  handed  to  them. 

The  Japanese  envoys  arrived  at  the  Department  at  2:05  and  went  to  the 
diplomatic  waiting  room  [Hull  wrote].  At  almost  that  moment  the  President 
telephoned  me  from  the  White  House.  His  voice  was  steady  but  clipped. 

He  said,  “There’s  a report  that  the  Japanese  have  attacked  Pearl  Harbor.” 

“Has  the  report  been  confirmed  ?”  I asked. 


63 


One  Day  of  Magic 

He  said,  “No.” 

While  each  of  us  indicated  his  belief  that  the  report  was  probably  true,  I 
suggested  that  he  have  it  confirmed,  having  in  mind  my  appointment  with  the 
Japanese  Ambassadors. ... 

Nomura  and  Kurusu  came  into  my  office  at  2 : 20. 1 received  them  coldly  and 
did  not  ask  them  to  sit  down. 

Nomura  diffidently  said  he  had  been  instructed  by  his  Government  to 
deliver  a document  to  me  at  one  o’clock,  but  that  difficulty  in  decoding  the 
message  had  delayed  him.  He  then  handed  me  his  Government’s  note. 

I asked  him  why  he  had  specified  one  o’clock  in  his  first  request  for  an 
interview. 

He  replied  that  he  did  not  know,  but  that  was  his  instruction. 

I made  a pretense  of  glancing  through  the  note.  I knew  its  contents  already 
but  naturally  could  give  no  indication  of  this  fact. 

After  reading  two  or  three  pages,  I asked  Nomura  whether  he  had  presented 
the  document  under  instructions  from  his  Government. 

He  replied  that  he  had. 

When  I finished  skimming  the  pages,  I turned  to  Nomura  and  put  my  eye  on 
him.  . 

“I  must  say,”  I said,  “that  in  all  my  conversations  with  you  during  the  last 
nine  months  I have  never  uttered  one  word  of  untruth.  This  is  borne  out  abso- 
lutely by  the  record.  In  all  my  fifty  years  of  public  service  I have  never  seen  a 
document  that  was  more  crowded  with  infamous  falsehoods  and  distortions 
infamous  falsehoods  and  distortions  on  a scale  so  huge  that  I never  imagined 
until  today  that  any  Government  on  this  planet  was  capable  of  uttering 

them.”  ... 

Nomura  seemed  about  to  say  something.  His  face  was  impassive,  but  I telt 

he  was  under  great  emotional  strain.  I stopped  him  with  a motion  of  my  hand. 

I nodded  toward  the  door.  The  Ambassadors  turned  without  a word  and 
walked  out,  their  heads  down. 

The  warlords’  hopes  of  shaving  the  warning  time  to  the  closest  possible 
margin  had  quite  literally  gone  up  in  the  smoke  of  attack,  and  Japan  had 
started  hostilities  without  giving  prior  notification.  Later,  this  failure  to 
declare  war  would  be  made  part  of  the  charges  on  which  the  Japanese  war 
criminals  were  tried — and  convicted,  some  of  them  paying  with  their  lives. 
Togo  would  try  to  exonerate  himself  by  throwing  the  blame  on  the  embassy 
personnel  for  neglecting  to  decipher  the  cables  promptly  and  to  type  the 
ultimatum  at  once.  Perhaps  some  lawyer’s  talking  point  might  have  been 
salvaged  if  the  ambassadors  had  grabbed  Okumura’s  original  copy,  no  matter 
how  messy,  and  taken  it  to  Hull  at  1 p.m.,  or  if  they  had  taken  the  first  few 
pages  of  the  fair  copy  at  1 p.m.  and  directed  the  embassy  staff  to  rush  the 
other  pages  over  as  completed.  But  even  if  the  entire  document  had  been 
delivered  on  time,  the  25  minutes  that  remained  until  the  attack  would  not 
have  been  sufficient  time  for  all  the  steps  needed  to  prevent  surprise:  reading 
the  document,  guessing  that  a military  attack  was  intended,  notifying  the 
War  and  Navy  departments,  composing,  enciphering,  transmitting,  and 


64 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


deciphering  an  appropriate  warning,  and  alerting  the  outpost  forces.  This  was 
just  what  the  shoguns  intended.  But  just  as  a multitude  of  human  errors  on 
the  part  of  Americans,  cascading  one  atop  the  other,  helped  make  tactical 
surprise  perfect,  so  a series  of  similar  human  errors  on  the  part  of  the  Japanese 
deprived  them  of  their  last  vestige  of  legality.

to  obstruct  Japan's  efforts  toward  ths  establishment  of 
peace  through  the  creation  of  a Kew  Order  in  East  Asia,

The  fourteenth  part  of  the  Japanese  ultimatum,  as  distributed  to  magic  recipients 

the  Honolulu  office  of  R.C.A.,  picked  up  a batch  of  cables  for  delivery.  He 
knew  that  the  war  had  started  and  that  it  was  the  Japanese  who  were  attack- 
ing the  ships  in  the  harbor,  but  he  felt  he  had  his  job  to  do  anyway.  He 
glanced  at  the  addresses  on  the  envelopes,  including  the  one  marked  “Com- 
manding General,”  and  planned  an  efficient  route.  Shafter  was  well  down  the 
list.  His  motorcycle  progressed  slowly  through  the  jammed  traffic;  once  he 
was  stopped  by  National  Guardsmen  who  had  almost  taken  him  for  a para-

trooper.  At  11:45,  almost  two  hours  after  the  last  attackers  had  vanished, 
Marshall’s  warning  message  was  delivered  to  the  signal  officer.  It  got  to  the 
decoding  officer  at  2:40  that  afternoon  and  to  Short  himself  at  3.  He  took  one 
look  at  it  and  threw  it  into  the  wastebasket,  saying  that  it  wasn’t  of  the 
slightest  interest. 

In  Tokyo,  Grew  was  awakened  at  7 a.m.  by  the  telephone,  summoning  him 
to  a meeting  at  7 : 30  with  Togo.  On  Grew’s  arrival,  the  Foreign  Minister  gave 
him  the  Emperor’s  reply  to  the  President.  He  thanked  Grew  for  his  coopera- 
tion and  saw  him  off  at  the  door.  Four  hours  had  elapsed  since  the  attack  had

and  China  at  war.  This  intention  has  been  revealed  clearly  daring 
the  course  of  the  present  negotiation.  Thus,  the  earnest  hope 
of  the  Japanese  Government  to  adjust  Japanese-American  re- 
lations and  to  preserve  and  promote  the  peace  of  the  Pacific 
through  cooperation  with  the  American  Government  has  finally 
been  lost. 

The  Japanese  Government  regrets  to  have  to  notify  hereby 
the  American  Government  that  in  view  of  the  attitude  of  the 
American  Government  it  cannot  but  consider  thet  it  is  impossible

December  7,  1941. 

The  last  page  of  the  Japanese  note  as  typed  by  First  Secretary  Katzuso  Okumura  and 
handed  to  Secretary  of  State  Cordell  Hull  while  Pearl  Harbor  was  being  attacked 

begun,  but  Togo  never  mentioned  it.  Shortly  thereafter,  Grew  learned  of  the 
outbreak  of  hostilities  from  an  extra  of  the  Yomiuri  Shimbun  hawked  outside 
his  window.  The  Japanese  soon  closed  the  embassy  gates  and  prohibited 
cipher  telegrams.  Grew  ordered  execution  of  the  State  Department  regulation 
to  destroy  all  codes.  The  embassy’s  second  and  third  secretaries,  Charles  E. 
Bohlen  and  James  Espy,  locked  the  code  room  from  the  inside  and  destroyed 
the  several  score  documents.  “No  Japanese  interrupted  that  process,  Grew 
wrote,  “nor  could  he  have,  since  the  heavy  door  of  the  code  room  was  secuiely 
locked.  None  of  our  codes,  nor  any  part  of  them,  nor  any  of  our  confidential 
correspondence  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  Japanese.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  Japanese  themselves  were  not  so  smart.  They  did  all  right  in  Washing- 
ton, breaking  up  their  last  code  machine  and  burning  all  remaining  codes  after 
encoding  a final  message  that  they  were  so  doing — the  last  message  sent  on  the 
Washington-Tokyo  circuit,  and  read,  of  course,  by  the  American  code- 
breakers. But  in  Honolulu,  police  guarding  the  consulate  after  the  attack 
smelled  papers  burning  and  saw  smoke  coming  from  behind  a door.  Fearing  a 
conflagration,  they  broke  in  and  found  the  consulate  staff-  burning  its  remain- 
ing documents  in  a washtub  on  the  floor.  The  police  confiscated  what  proved 
to  be  the  telegraph  file  plus  five  burlap  sacks  full  of  torn  papers.  These 
reached  Rochefort’s  unit  that  evening.  Woodward  was  still  working  long 
hours  in  an  attempt  to  break  the  pa-k2  messages  that  Mayfield  had  brought. 
Since  the  attack,  the  fear  of  sabotage  had  swelled  to  enormous  proportions. 
“Nothing  coming  to  light,”  his  notes  read,  “so  it  was  decided  to  reverse 
the  process  of  deciphering,  allowing  for  the  encoding  party  to  have  either 
purposely  encrypted  the  messages  in  this  manner  or  possibly  to  have 
made  an  error  in  using  the  system  employed  due  to  confusion.  This  netted 
results.” 

At  about  2 a.m.  on  December  9,  he  cracked  one  of  the  messages  picked 
up  in  the  consulate.  It  was  one  sent  from  the  Foreign  Ministry  to  Kita  on  the 
6th:  “Please  wire  immediately  re  the  latter  part  of  my  #123  any  movements 
of  the  fleet  after  the  4th.”  With  this,  he  was  soon  able  to  unlock  the  other 
pa-k2  messages — including  the  long  one  setting  up  Kuhn’s  light-signaling 
system.  At  about  the  same  time  in  op-20-gz,  Kramer,  who  had  been  too  busy 
with  the  13  parts  on  Saturday  to  work  on  this  message,  was  breaking  out 
charts  of  Oahu  and  Maui  to  help  in  degarbling  the  message,  which  was  finally 
reduced  to  plaintext  by  Thursday.  Marshall  later  said  that  it  was  the  first 
message  that  clearly  indicated  an  attack  on  Pearl  to  him — but  this  was,  of 
course,  after  the  fact.  The  information  from  it  was  immediately  passed  to 
counterintelligence  units  in  Hawaii,  where  invasion  was  thought  highly 
probable.  Their  agents  interrogated  residents  in  the  neighborhood  of  the 
houses  mentioned  in  the  dispatch  and  listened  to  recordings  of  kgmb  want 
ads,  but  found  that  the  signal  system  had  never  been  used.  They  arrested 
Kuhn,  who  confirmed  this.  He  was  convicted  on  espionage  charges  and 
imprisoned  at  Leavenworth  Penitentiary  until  after  the  war,  when  he  was 
paroled  to  leave  the  country. 

On  December  7,  while  Honolulu  was  still  reeling  from  the  devastation  of 
the  attack,  F.C.C.  monitors  there  picked  up  a Japanese-language  news 
broadcast  from  station  jzi  in  Japan.  The  announcer  boasted  of  a “death- 
defying  raid”  at  Pearl,  reported  other  events,  and,  about  halfway  through  the 
broadcast,  declared:  “Allow  me  to  especially  make  a weather  forecast  at  this 
time:  west  wind  clear.”  The  O.N.I.  translator  noted  that  “as  far  as  1 can 
recollect,  no  such  weather  forecast  has  ever  been  made  before”  and  that  “it 
may  be  some  sort  of  code.”  It  was  the  long-awaited  winds  code  execute, 
apparently  sent  indicating  war  with  Britain  to  make  sure  that  some  Japanese 


67 


One  Day  of  Magic 

outpost  that  had  not  reported  destroying  its  codes  by  the  codeword  haruna 
would  burn  them. 

Shortly  after  noon  in  Washington  on  the  day  after  the  attack,  the  President 
of  the  United  States  stood  before  a stormily  applauding  joint  session  of 
Congress  and  opened  a black  looseleaf  notebook.  When  the  cheers  had 
subsided  into  a hushed  solemnity,  he  began  to  speak : 

Yesterday,  December  7,  1941 — a date  which  will  live  in  infamy — the  United 
States  of  America  was  suddenly  and  deliberately  attacked  by  naval  and  air 
forces  of  the  Empire  of  Japan. 

He  alluded  to  the  fatal  Japanese  delay  in  delivering  the  ultimatum: 

The  United  States  was  at  peace  with  that  nation  and,  at  the  solicitation  of 
Japan,  was  still  in  conversation  with  its  Government  and  its  Emperor  looking 
toward  the  maintenance  of  peace  in  the  Pacific.  Indeed,  one  hour  after  Japanese 
air  squadrons  had  commenced  bombing  in  Oahu,  the  Japanese  Ambassador 
to  the  United  States  and  his  colleague  delivered  to  the  Secretary  of  State  a formal 
reply  to  a recent  American  message.  While  this  reply  stated  that  it  seemed  useless 
to  continue  the  existing  diplomatic  negotiations,  it  contained  no  threat  or  hint 
of  war  or  armed  attack. 

The  war  was  on.  The  most  treacherous  onslaught  in  history  had  succeeded. 
Japan  had  cloaked  the  strike  force  in  absolute  secrecy.  She  had  dissembled 
with  diplomatic  conversations  and  with  jabs  toward  the  south.  She  had — in  a 
precaution  whose  wisdom  she  but  dimly  realized — swathed  her  plans  in  a 
communications  security  so  all-enveloping  that  not  a whisper  of  them  ever 
floated  onto  the  airwaves. 

But  if  the  cryptanalysts  had  no  chance  to  warn  of  the  attack  and  save 
American  lives  before  the  war,  they  found  ample  opportunities  to  exert  their 
subtle  and  pervasive  talents  during  the  struggle.  In  the  1,350  days  of  conflict 
in  which  an  angry  America  turned  Japan's  tactical  victory  at  Pearl  Harbor 
into  total  strategic  defeat,  the  cryptanalysts,  in  the  words  of  the  Joint  Congres- 
sional Committee,  “contributed  enormously  to  the  defeat  of  the  enemy, 
greatly  shortened  the  war,  and  saved  many  thousands  of  lives.” 

That,  however,  is  another  story. 


The  Pageant  of  Cryptology 


2 


THE  FIRST  3,000  YEARS 


on  a day  nearly  4,000  years  ago,  in  a town  called  Menet  Khufu  bordering 
the  thin  ribbon  of  the  Nile,  a master  scribe  sketched  out  the  hieroglyphs  that 
told  the  story  of  his  lord’s  life — and  in  so  doing  he  opened  the  recorded  history 
of  cryptology. 

His  was  not  a system  of  secret  writing  as  the  modern  world  knows  it ; he 
used  no  fully  developed  code  of  hieroglyphic  symbol  substitutions.  His 
inscription,  carved  about  1900  b.c.  into  the  living  rock  in  the  main  chamber  of 
the  tomb  of  the  nobleman  Khnumhotep  II,  merely  uses  some  unusual  hiero- 
glyphic symbols  here  and  there  in  place  of  the  more  ordinary  ones.  Most  occur 
in  the  last  20  columns  of  the  inscription’s  222,  in  a section  recording  the  monu- 
ments that  Khnumhotep  had  erected  in  the  service  of  the  pharaoh  Amenemhet 
II.  The  intention  was  not  to  make  it  hard  to  read  the  text.  It  was  to  impart  a 
dignity  and  authority  to  it,  perhaps  in  the  same  way  that  a government  procla- 
mation will  spell  out  “In  the  year  of  Our  Lord  One  thousand  eight  hundred 
and  sixty  three”  instead  of  just  writing  “1863.”  The  anonymous  scribe  may 
also  have  been  demonstrating  his  knowledge  for  posterity.  Thus  the  inscription 
was  not  secret  writing,  but  it  incorporated  one  of  the  essential  elements  of 
cryptography:  a deliberate  transformation  of  the  writing.  It  is  the  oldest  text 
known  to  do  so. 

As  Egyptian  civilization  waxed,  as  the  writing  developed  and  the  tombs  of 
the  venerated  dead  multiplied,  these  transformations  grew  more  complicated, 
more  contrived,  and  more  common.  Eventually  the  scribes  were  replacing  the 
usual  hieroglyphic  form  of  a letter,  like  the  full-face  mouth  representing  /r/, 
by  a different  form,  like  a profiled  mouth.  Sometimes  they  used  new  hiero- 
glyphs whose  first  sound  represented  the  letter  desired,  as  a picture  of  a pig, 
“rer,”  would  mean  /r/.  Sometimes  the  sounds  of  the  two  hieroglyphs  differed 
but  their  images  resembled  one  another.  The  horned  asp,  representing  /f/, 
was  replaced  by  the  serpent,  representing  /z/.  And  sometimes  the  scribes  used 
a hieroglyph  on  the  rebus  principle,  as  in  English  a picture  of  a bee  might 
represent  b\  thus  a sailboat,  “khentey,”  stands  for  another  Egyptian  word 
khentey,  which  means  “who  presides  at” — this  latter  being  part  of  a title  of 
the  god  Amon,  “he  who  presides  at  Karnak.”  These  procedures  of  acrophony 
and  the  rebus  are  essentially  those  of  ordinary  Egyptian  writing;  it  was 

71 


72 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


through  them  that  the  hieroglyphics  originally  acquired  their  sound  values^ 
The  Egyptian  transformations  merely  carry  them  further,  elaborate  them,  and 
make  them  more  artificial. 

The  transformations  occur  in  funerary  formulas,  in  a hymn  to  Thoth,  in  a 
chapter  of  the  Book  of  the  Dead,  on  the  sarcophagus  of  the  pharaoh  Seti  I,  in 
royal  titles  displayed  in  Luxor,  on  the  architrave  of  the  Temple  of  Luxor,  on 
stele,  in  laudatory  biographic  inscriptions.  There  is  nothing  meant  to  be 
concealed  in  all  this;  indeed,  many  of  the  statements  are  repeated  in  ordinary 
form  right  next  to  the  altered  ones.  Why,  then,  the  transformations?  Some- 
times for  essentially  the  same  reason  as  in  Khnumhotep’s  tomb:  to  impress 
the  reader.  Occasionally  for  a calligraphic  or  decorative  effect;  rarely,  to 
indicate  a contemporary  pronunciation;  perhaps  even  for  a deliberate 
archaism  as  a reaction  against  foreign  influence. 

But  many  inscriptions  are  tinctured,  for  the  first  time,  with  the  second 
essential  for  cryptology-secrecy.  In  a few  cases,  the  secrecy  was  intended  to 
increase  the  mystery  and  hence  the  arcane  magical  powers  of  certain  religious 
texts.  But  the  secrecy  in  many  more  cases  resulted  from  the  understandable 
desire  of  the  Egyptians  to  have  passersby  read  their  epitaphs  and  so  confer 
upon  the  departed  the  blessings  written  therein.  In  Egypt,  with  its  concentra- 
tion upon  the  afterlife,  the  number  of  these  inscriptions  soon  proliferated  to 
such  an  extent  that  the  attention  and  the  goodwill  of  visitors  flagged.  To 
revive  their  interest,  the  scribes  deliberately  made  the  inscriptions  a bit 
obscure.  They  introduced  the  cryptographic  signs  to  catch  the  reader’s  eye, 
make  him  wonder,  and  tempt  him  into  unriddling  them— and  so  into  reading 
the  blessings.  It  was  a sort  of  Madison  Avenue  technique  in  the  Valley  of  the 
Kings.  But  the  technique  failed  utterly.  Instead  of  interesting  the  readers,  it 
evidently  destroyed  even  the  slightest  desire  to  read  the  epitaphs,  for  soon 
after  the  funerary  cryptography  was  begun,  it  was  abandoned. 

The  addition  of  secrecy  to  the  transformations  produced  cryptograp  y. 
True,  it  was  more  of  a game  than  anything  else— it  sought  to  delay  compre- 
hension for  only  the  shortest  possible  time,  not  the  longest— and  the  crypt- 
analysis was,  likewise,  just  a puzzle.  Egypt’s  was  thus  a quasi  cryptology  in 
contrast  to  the  deadly  serious  science  of  today.  Yet  great  things  have  small 
beginnings,  and  these  hieroglyphs  did  include,  though  in  an  imperfect  fashion 
the  two  elements  of  secrecy  and  transformation  that  comprise  the  essential 
attributes  of  the  science.  And  so  cryptology  was  born. 

In  its  first  3,000  years,  it  did  not  grow  steadily.  Cryptology  arose  independ- 
ently in  many  places,  and  in  most  of  them  it  died  the  deaths  of  its  civilizations. 
In  other  places,  it  survived,  embedded  in  a literature,  and  from  this  the  next 
generation  could  climb  to  higher  levels.  But  progress  was  slow  and  jerky. 
More  was  lost  than  retained.  Much  of  the  history  of  cryptology  of  this  time 
is  a patchwork,  a crazy  quilt  of  unrelated  items,  sprouting,  flourishing, 
withering.  Only  toward  the  Western  Renaissance  does  the  accreting  know- 


The  First  3,000  Years  73 

ledge  begin  to  build  up  a momentum.  The  story  of  cryptology  during  these 
years  is,  in  other  words,  exactly  the  story  of  mankind. 


China,  the  only  high  civilization  of  antiquity  to  use  ideographic  writing, 
seems  never  to  have  developed  much  real  cryptography — perhaps  for  that 
reason.  Diplomats  and  military  authorities  relied  mainly  on  oral  statements, 
memorized  and  delivered  by  messenger.  For  written  messages,  the  Chinese 
would  often  write  on  exceedingly  thin  silk  or  paper,  which  they  rolled  into  a 
ball  and  covered  with  wax.  The  messenger  hid  the  wax  ball,  or  “la  wan,” 
somewhere  about  his  person,  or  in  his  rectum,  or  he  sometimes  swallowed  it. 
This,  of  course,  was  a form  of  steganography. 

Actual  cryptography  often  involved  open  codes.  If  a man’s  name  included 
the  ideogram  for  “chrysanthemum,”  the  correspondents  would  refer  to  him  as 
“the  yellow  flower.”  But  for  military  purposes,  the  11th-century  compilation, 
Wu-ching  tsung-yao  (“Essentials  from  Military  Classics”),  recommended  a

true  if  small  code.  To  a list  of  40  plaintext  items,  ranging  from  requests  for 
bows  and  arrows  to  the  report  of  a victory,  the  correspondents  would  assign 
the  first  40  ideograms  of  a poem.  Then,  when  a lieutenant  wished,  for  example, 
to  request  more  arrows,  he  was  to  write  the  corresponding  ideogram  at  a 
specified  place  on  an  ordinary  dispatch  and  stamp  his  seal  on  it.  The  general 
could  put  down  the  same  character  with  his  own  seal  to  indicate  approval,  or 
his  seal  without  the  character  to  indicate  disapproval.  Even  if  the  message 
were  intercepted,  the  code  portion  would  remain  secret. 

It  is  questionable,  however,  whether  such  methods  were  much  used.  The 
greatest  conqueror  of  them  all,  Genghis  Khan,  seems  never  to  have  made  use 
of  cryptography.  Nor  do  ciphers  seem  possible.  The  ideographic  nature  of 
the  language  precludes  them.  The  cipher-like  technique  of  altering  the  form 
of  the  ideograms  by  shifting  lines  or  elements  from  one  place  to  another  in  the 
pattern  would  be,  one  authority  has  said,  neither  practical  nor  effective.  In 
fact,  one  of  the  apparently  few  cryptologic  episodes  in  the  history  of  China 
involves  a Western  alphabet. 


74 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


In  1722,  Yin-t’ang,  ninth  son  of  the  late  Emperor  Sheng-tsu,  lost  out  to  his 
elder  brother,  Yin-chen,  in  a struggle  for  the  throne.  He  was  banished  to 
Sining.  With  him  went  his  supporter,  a Portuguese  missionary  named  Joao 
Mourao,  who  had  taught  him  the  Latin  alphabet.  Yin-t  ang  used  it  for  a code 
with  his  son.  Early  in  1726,  a letter  from  the  son  in  this  alphabet  was  inter- 
cepted by  agents  of  Emperor  Yin-chen.  Ever  alert  for  such  an  opportunity,  the 
emperor  used  it  as  evidence  to  condemn  his  brother  s activities  as  treasonable, 
expel  him  from  the  Imperial  Clan,  and  remove  him  from  Sining  to  Paoting, 
Chihli.  Here  Yin-t’ang  was  confined  in  a small  house  surrounded  by  high  walls ; 
he  received  his  food  by  pulleys.  Within  a few  months  he  was  dead  of  dysentery. 
The  emperor  announced  that  his  brother  had  been  called  to  justice  by  the 
netherworld.  Mourao  himself  died  in  confinement  at  about  the  same  time. 

Why  did  China,  so  far  ahead  of  other  civilizations  in  so  many  things,  not 
develop  cryptography  ? An  astute  comment  by  Professor  Owen  Lattimore  of 
the  University  of  Leeds  may  give  the  reason.  “Although  writing  is  extremely 
old  in  the  Chinese  culture,  literacy  was  always  restricted  to  such  a small 
minority  that  the  mere  act  of  putting  something  into  writing  was  to  a certain 
extent  equivalent  to  putting  it  into  code.” 

jn  China’s  great  neighbor  to  the  west,  India,  whose  civilization  likewise 
developed  early  and  to  high  estate,  several  forms  of  secret  communications 
were  known  and,  apparently,  practiced.  The  Artha-sastra,  a classic  work  on 
statecraft  attributed  to  Kautilya,  in  describing  the  espionage  service  of  India 
as  practically  riddling  the  country  with  spies,  recommended  that  the  officers 
of  the  institutes  of  espionage  give  their  spies  their  assignments  by  secret  writ- 
ing. The  Lalita-  Vistara,  a work  that  extols  the  career  and  excellencies  of  the 
Buddha,  tells  how  Buddha  astounded  the  tutor  who  was  to  teach  him  writing 
by  enumerating  64  different  kinds.  Some  of  these,  such  as  the  perpendicular 
writing,  or  the  disordered  writing,  or  the  scattered  writing,  or  the  cross  writ- 
ing, are  sometimes  regarded  as  cryptographic,  though  many  are  fanciful  and 
probably  never  existed. 

Perhaps  most  interesting  to  cryptologists,  amateur  or  professional,  is  that 
Vatsyayana’s  famous  textbook  of  erotics,  the  Kama-sutra,  lists  secret  wiiting 
as  one  of  the  64  arts,  or  yogas,  that  women  should  know  and  practice.  It  is 
45th  in  a list  that  begins  with  vocal  music  and  runs  through  prestidigitation, 
solution  of  verbal  puzzles,  and  exercises  in  enigmatic  poetry.  The  yoga  is 
called  “mlecchita-vikalpa.”  In  his  commentary  on  the  Kama-sutra , Yasod- 
hara  describes  two  kinds  of  mlecchita-vikalpa.  One  is  called  kautiliyam,  in 
which  the  letter  substitutions  are  based  upon  phonetic  relations— the  vowels 
become  consonants,  for  example.  A simplification  ot  this  form  is  called  dur- 
bodha.”  Another  kind  of  secret  writing  is  “muladeviya."  Its  cipher  alphabet 
consists  merely  of  the  reciprocal  one

with  all  other  letters  remaining  unchanged.  Muladeviya  existed  in  both  a 
spoken  form — as  such  it  figures  in  Indian  literature  and  is  used  by  traders, 
with  geographical  variations — and  a written  form,  in  which  case  it  is  called 
“gudhalekhya.” 

Beyond  these  unquestioned  types  of  cryptography,  ancient  India  made  use 
of  allusive  language,  a sort  of  impromptu  open  code  called  “sabhasa,”  and  a 
finger  communication,  “nirabhasa,”  in  which  the  phalanges  stand  for  the 
consonants  and  the  joints  for  the  vowels.  Deaf  and  dumb  people  still  use  it, 
as  do  traders  and  moneylenders. 

Whether  India  owes  this  profusion  of  mentions  of  cryptography  to  actual 
use  or  to  her  great  interest  in  grammar  and  language  in  general — the  world’s 
first  grammarian,  Panini,  was  an  Indian — remains  in  question.  That  crypto- 
logy is  not  mentioned  in  the  classic  drama  of  political  intrigue,  the  Mudra- 
Raksasa,  suggests  that  it  was  not  widely  used.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Artha- 
sastra,  which  was  written  sometime  between  321  and  300  b.c.,  recommended 
that  ambassadors  use  cryptanalysis  to  obtain  intelligence:  “If  there  is  no 
possibility  of  carrying  on  any  such  conversation  (conversation  with  the  people 
regarding  their  loyalty),  he  [the  envoy]  may  try  to  gather  such  information  by 
observing  the  talk  of  beggars,  intoxicated  and  insane  persons,  or  of  persons 
babbling  in  sleep,  or  by  observing  the  signs  made  in  places  of  pilgrimage  and 
temples,  or  by  deciphering  paintings  or  secret  writings.”  (One  begins  to 
wonder  whether  Kautilya,  by  putting  cryptanalysis  in  the  company  of  such 
sources,  meant  to  praise  or  damn  it.)  Nevertheless,  though  he  gives  no  sugges- 
tions on  how  to  solve  either  paintings  or  secret  writings,  the  fact  that  he  knows 
that  solution  is  possible  bespeaks  some  cryptologic  sophistication.  His  is, 
moreover,  the  first  reference  in  history  to  cryptanalysis  for  political  purposes. 

The  fourth  great  civilization  of  antiquity,  the  Mesopotamian,  rather 
paralleled  Egypt  early  in  its  cryptographic  evolution,  but  then  surpassed  it, 
attaining  a surprisingly  modern  level  of  cryptography.  Its  oldest  encipherment 
appears  in  a tiny  cuneiform  tablet  only  about  3 by  2 inches,  dating  from 
about  1500  b.c.  and  found  on  the  site  of  ancient  Seleucia  on  the  banks  of  the 
Tigris.  It  contains  the  earliest  known  formula  for  the  making  of  glazes  for 
pottery.  The  scribe,  jealously  guarding  his  professional  secret,  used  cuneiform 
signs — which  could  have  several  different  syllabic  values — in  their  least 
common  values.  His  method  resembles  George  Bernard  Shaw’s  way  of  using 
the  /f/  sound  of  gh  in  “tough,”  the  /i/  sound  of  o in  “women,”  and  the 
/sh/  sound  of  ti  in  “nation”  to  write  fish  as  ghoti.  The  scribe  also  truncated 
sounds  by  ignoring  the  final  consonant  of  several  syllabic  signs,  and  spelled 
the  same  word  with  different  signs  at  different  places.  Interestingly,  as  know- 
ledge of  glaze-making  spread,  the  need  for  secrecy  evaporated,  and  later  texts 
were  written  in  straightforward  language. 

The  Babylonian  and  Assyrian  scribes  sometimes  used  rare  or  unusual 
cuneiform  signs  in  signing  and  dating  their  clay  tablets.  These  ending  for- 
mulas, called  “colophons,”  were  short  and  stereotyped,  and  the  substitution 


76 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


of  the  unusual  signs  for  the  usual  were  not  intended  to  conceal  but  simply  to 
show  off  the  scribe’s  knowledge  of  cuneiform  to  later  copyists.  Nothing 
precisely  like  this  exists  in  the  modern  world,  because  literacy  is  so  widespread 
and  spelling  so  standardized.  But  comparable  might  be  a businessmans 
writing  “We  beg  to  acknowledge  receipt  of  your  communication  of  the  25th 
ult  ” instead  of  “Thank  you  for  your  letter  of  May  25,”  or  a schoolboy’s  using 
long  words  where  short  would  do-both  seeking  to  impress  their  readers  with 

their  learning. 

In  the  final  period  of  cuneiform  writing,  in  colophons  written  at  Uruk  (in 
present-day  Iraq)  under  the  Seleucid  kings  in  the  last  few  score  years  before 
the  Christian  era,  occasional  scribes  converted  their  names  into  numbers.  1 he 
encipherment— if  such  it  be— may  have  been  only  for  amusement  or  to  show 
off.  Because  colophons  are  so  stereotyped,  and  because  several  of  the  en- 
ciphered ones  have  only  one  or  two  number  signs  among  many  plaintext, 
Assyriologists  have  been  able  to  “cryptanalyze”  them.  For  example,  a tablet 
giving  lunar  eclipses  for  from  130  to  1 13  b.c.  includes  in  its  colophon  pal.h 
21  50  10  40  la.  . . Comparing  this  with  the  identical  formula  in  plaintext 
in  another  tablet,  Otto  Neugebauer  determined  that  21  = Am,  50  = u 
10  40  = An-tu.  The  formula  reads:  “He  who  worships  Anu  and  Antu  shall 
not  remove  it  [the  tablet].”  With  the  help  of  these  equivalencies,  Erie  Leichty 
attacked  the  signature  at  the  foot  of  a large  tablet  reciting  a myth  of  the 
goddess  Ishtar  that  might  be  an  indirect  source  of  the  biblical  story  of  Esther, 
whose  name  might  be  another  version  of  “Ishtar.”  The  signature  reads  tuppi 
'21  35  35  26  44  apil  '21  11  20  42,”  or  “tablet  of  Mr.  21  35  35  26  44,  son  of 
Mr.  21  1 1 20  42.”  Leichty  suggested  that  the  solution  was  tablet  of  Mr.  Anu- 
aba-uttirri,  son  of  Mr.  Anu-bel-su-nu,”  whose  father-son  relationship  is  well 

known.  , . , 

Other  tablets  employ  the  same  numbers  with  the  same  values.  No  simple 

relationship  between  the  equivalencies  appears.  “A  check  of  the  various 
lexical  series  shows  that  the  numbers  are  not  based  on  a counting  of  signs 
either  forward  from  the  beginning  of  the  series,  nor  backward  from  the  end, 
wrote  Leichty  “It  is  of  course  possible  that  a tablet  of  equations  between 
numbers  and  signs  existed.”  He  suggested  that  two  little  tablet-fragments 
from  Susa  (in  present-day  Iran)  might  comprise  such  a codebook,  but  added 
that  they  were  too  short  to  be  certain.  The  broken  pieces  of  clay  list  cuneiform 
numbers  in  order  in  a vertical  column;  opposite  them  stand  cuneiform  signs. 
Unfortunately,  none  of  the  numbers  used  in  the  cryptograms  occur  on  these 
fragments  (except  for  35,  whose  cuneiform  sign  is  blurred  to  illegibility),  and 
so  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  whether  these  tablets  served  as  the  codebook 
for  the  colophon  cryptography.  But  if  they  are  indeed  codebooks,  they  are  the 
oldest  in  the  world. 

The  Holy  Scriptures  themselves  have  not  escaped  a touch  of  cryptography 
—or  protocryptography,  to  be  precise,  for  the  element  of  secrecy  is  lacking.

As  with  the  hieroglyphics  in  the  tomb  of  Khnumhotep  or  the  colophons  of  the 
Mesopotamian  scribes,  the  transformations  are  present  without  any  apparent 
desire  to  conceal.  Probably  the  main  motives  in  the  biblical  transformations, 
as  with  the  others,  were  the  human  ones  of  pride  and  a longing  for  immortality' 
attained  here  by  making  a textual  alteration  which,  as  later  scribes  faithfully 
copied  it,  would  transmit  a bit  of  one’s  self  down  through  the  centuries.  If  this 
was  in  fact  the  idea,  it  most  certainly  succeeded. 

Hebrew  tradition  lists  three  different  transformations  in  the  Old  Testament 
(none  are  recorded  for  the  New).  In  Jeremiah  25:26  and  51:41,  the  form 


A cuneiform  tablet  from  Susa  lists  the  numbers  from  1 to  8 and  from  32  to  35  opposite 
parallel  columns  of  cuneiform  signs  in  what  might  be  the  oldest  codebook  in  the  world 


sheshach  appears  in  place  of  Babe!  (“Babylon”).  The  second  occurrence 
stiikingly  demonstrates  the  lack  of  a secrecy  motive,  since  the  phrase  with 
SHESHACH  is  immediately  followed  by  one  using  “Babylon”: 

How  is  Sheshach  taken! 

And  the  praise  of  the  whole  earth  seized! 

How  is  Babylon  become  an  astonishment 
Among  the  nations! 

Confirmation  that  sheshach  is  really  a substitute  for  Babe / and  not  a 
wholly  separate  place  comes  from  the  Septuagint  and  the  Targums, 
the  Aramaic  paraphrases  of  the  Bible,  which  simply  use  “Babel”  where 
the  Old  Testament  version  has  sheshach.  The  second  transformation, 

fLufjmiah  51 :1’  puts  LEB  KAMAI  (“heart  of  my  enemy”)  for  Kashdim 
(“Chaldeans”). 

Both  transformations  resulted  from  the  application  of  a traditional  sub- 
st'tutmn  ol  letters  called  “atbash,”  in  which  the  last  letter  of  the  Hebrew 
alphabet  replaces  the  first,  and  vice  versa;  the  next-to-last  replaces  the  second.

Consequently,  in  Babel,  the  repeated  b,  or  beth,  the  second  letter  of  the 
Hebrew  alphabet,  became  the  repeated  sh,  or  shin,  the  next-to-last  letter  m 
SHESHACH.  Similarly,  the  /,  or  lamed,  became  the  hard  ch,  or  kaph.  The  kaph  of 
Kashdim  reciprocally  became  the  lamed  of  leb  kamai.  In  this  determination, 
the  Hebrew  letters  sin  and  shin,  which  differ  only  by  where  a dot  is  placed, 
are  regarded  as  the  same  letter.  The  only  letters  in  Hebrew  are  consonants 
and  two  silent  letters,  aleph  and  ayin;  vowels  are  represented  by  dots  or  hnes, 
usually  below  the  letters.  What  is  a final  / in  the  English  leb  kamai  is  a letter 
yod  in  Hebrew,  whose  atbash  reciprocal  is  mem.  The  word  atbash 
incidentally,  derives  from  the  very  procedure  it  denotes,  since  it  is  composed 
of  aleph,  taw,  beth,  and  shin-the  first,  last,  second,  and  next-to-last  letters 
of  the  Hebrew  alphabet. 

Both  SHESHACH  and  leb  kamai  have  considerably  embarrassed  biblical 
commentators.  They  have  devised  numerous  ingenious  explanations  lor  why 
so  odd  a result  as  leb  kamai  would  be  desired,  or  why  secrecy  was  minted. 
Some  have  even  thought  Sheshach  the  name  of  a Babylonian  district  But  the 
idea  of  simple  scribal  manipulation,  which  would  mean  that  such  desires 
never  even  existed,  and  which  is  advanced  by  modern  authorities  and  bolstered 
bv  the  similar  examples  from  other  cultures  and  by  the  predilection  of  scribes 
for  amusing  themselves  with  word  and  alphabet  games,  seems  the  best  explana- 

ll°  The  two  transformations  by  atbash  are  straightforward  and  universally 
recognized.  The  third  transformation  in  the  Old  Testament,  which  resulted 
from  a different  substitution  system,  is  disputed.  The  system  is  called  “albam. 

It  splits  the  Hebrew  alphabet  in  half  and  equates  the  two  halves.  Thus,  the 
first  letter  of  the  first  half,  aleph,  substitutes  for  the  first  letter  ot  the  secon 
half,  lamed,  and  vice  versa;  the  second  of  the  first  half,  beth,  tor  the  secon 
of  the  second  half,  mem,  and  vice  versa;  and  so  on.  The  term  ’ albam  derives 
from  the  first  four  letters  of  this  arrangement.  According  to  the  Midrash 
Rabbah  (Numbers  18:21),  the  name  tabeel  in  Isaiah  7:6  is  an  albam  trans- 
formation for  Remala,  or  “Remaliah,”  who  figures  in  verses  1 and  4.  But 
while  the  albam  works  for  the  first  two  letters  (the  third,  lamed,  retains  its 
identity  because  it  would  otherwise  be  transformed  into  a silent  aleph),  the 
“solution"  does  not  clarify  the  text.  The  Midrash  Rabbah  does  not  give  any 
reasons  for  thinking  it  albam.  Most  authorities  seem  to  regard  Tabec  as  a 
corruption  or  some  form  of  contemptuous  epithet,  and  not  as  albam.  In  this 


79 


The  First  3,000  Years 

connection  it  might  be  noted  that  many  authorities  also  think  that  the  mean- 
ingless names  Shadrach,  Meshach,  and  Abed-nego  represent  distortions, 
deliberate  or  accidental,  of  the  names  of  real  kings  or  countries.  Shadrach, 
for  example,  may  stand  for  Marduk — Hebrew  samekh  and  mem  look  alike, 
and  the  transposition  of  consonants  is  not  an  uncommon  linguistic  pheno- 
menon. 

Hebrew  literature  records  a third  traditional  form  of  letter  substitution.  It 
is  called  “atbah,”  and,  like  atbash  and  albam,  its  name  stems  from  its  system. 
This  is  based  on  Hebrew  numbers,  which,  like  Roman  numbers,  were  written 
with  the  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet.  Within  the  first  nine  letters  of  the 
alphabet,  the  substitutes  were  chosen  so  that  their  numerical  value  would  add 
up  to  10.  Thus,  aleph,  the  first  letter,  would  be  replaced  by  teth,  the  ninth, 
and  vice  versa;  beth,  the  second,  by  heth,  the  eighth,  and  vice  versa.  The 
remaining  letters  were  paired  on  a similar  system  that  would  total  to  the 
Hebrew  digital  version  of  100.  In  decimal  notation,  this  means  that  the  two 
letters  will  add  up  to  28.  Thus  mem,  the  13th  letter,  and  samekh,  the  15th, 
replace  one  another.  What  happens  to  the  19th  letter  and  those  beyond  is  not 
clear.  The  5th  letter,  he,  and  the  14th,  nun,  which  under  the  system  would 
represent  themselves,  are  made  to  replace  each  other.  This  rather  confusing 
system  of  atbah  is  not  used  in  the  Bible,  though  there  is  at  least  one  use  in 
the  Babylonian  Talmud  ( Seder  Mo'ed,  Sukkah,  52b).  This  example  plays  on 
the  word  “witness”  and  its  atbah  substitution  “master”  to  make  a moral 
point. 

These  three  substitutes  are  used  here  and  there  throughout  Hebrew  writing, 
particularly  atbash,  which  is  the  most  common.  Their  importance  consists, 
however,  in  that  the  use  of  atbash  in  the  Bible  sensitized  the  monks  and 
scribes  of  the  Middle  Ages  to  the  idea  of  letter  substitution.  And  from  them 
flowed  the  modern  use  of  ciphers — as  distinct  from  codes — as  a means  of 
secret  communication. 

While  sheshach  and  leb  kamai  are  an  imperfect  cryptography  because, 
although  they  are  transformations,  they  lack  the  element  of  secrecy,  another 
“cryptogram”  in  the  Bible — perhaps  the  most  famous  in  the  world — is 
imperfect  for  the  opposite  reason.  It  was  shrouded  in  secrecy,  but  it  apparently 
involved  no  transformation! 

This  is  the  message  of  the  handwriting  on  the  wall.  It  appeared  omin- 
ously at  Belshazzar’s  feast:  mene  mene  tekel  upharsin.  The  real  mystery  is 
not  what  the  words  meant  but  why  the  king’s  wise  men  could  not  read  it.  The 
Bible  says  nothing  about  secret  or  unusual  writing,  and  the  words  themselves 
are  ordinary  roots  in  Aramaic  (the  language,  related  to  Hebrew,  in  which  the 
book  of  Daniel  is  written)  meaning  “numbered,”  “weighed,”  and  “divided.” 
When  Belshazzar  summoned  Daniel,  the  latter  had  no  difficulty  in  reading  the 
handwriting  and  interpreting  the  three  words:  “mene,  God  hath  numbered 
thy  kingdom,  and  brought  it  to  an  end.  tekel,  thou  art  weighed  in  the 
balances,  and  art  found  wanting,  peres,  thy  kingdom  is  divided  [perisa]  and 


g0  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

given  to  the  Medes  and  Persians  [paras],”  with  the  extra  play  on  peres, 
which,  in  Aramaic,  would  be  identical  with  upharsin.  The  message  may  also 
reflect  a series  of  pieces  of  money  whose  names  stem  from  the  Aramaic  roots 
a mina  a tekel  (the  Aramaic  equivalent  for  shekel,  which  is  60th  of  a mina), 
and  a peres,  which  is  a half-mina.  Though  the  order  is  illogical,  the  series 
might  symbolize  the  breaking  up  of  the  Babylonian  empire  and  its  wealth. 
Dr  Cyrus  Gordon  has  devised  an  ingenious  American  equivalent  that  makes 

this  clear:  “You  will  be  quartered,  halved,  and  cent  to  perdition. 

With  all  these  interpretations  possible,  it  seems  strange  that  the  Baby- 
lonian priests  could  not  read  what  was  essentially  a plain-language  message^ 
Perhaps  they  feared  to  give  the  bad  news  to  Belshazzar,  or  perhaps  God 
blinded  them  and  opened  the  eyes  of  Daniel.  Whatever  the  reason,  Daniel 
alone  penetrated  the  enigma  and  became,  in  consequence  the  first  known 
cryptanalyst.  And  just  as  there  were  giants  in  the  earth  in  those  days,  so  the 
biblical  reward  for  cryptanalysis  far  exceeded  any  that  has  been  given  ever 
since:  “They  clothed  Daniel  with  purple,  and  put  a chain  of  gold  around  his 
neck,  and  made  proclamation  concerning  him  that  he  should  rule  as  one  of 
three  in  the  kingdom.” 

“Queen  Anteia,  Proetus’s  wife,  had  fallen  in  love  with  the  handsome 
youth  ” the  “incomparable  Bellerophon  ...  who  was  endowed  with  every 
manly  grace,  and  begged  him  to  satisfy  her  passion  in  secret.”  So  Homer 
begins  the  story  in  the  Iliad  that  includes  the  world’s  first  conscious  reference 

to— as  distinct  from  use  of— secret  writing. 

“But  Bellerophon  was  a man  of  sound  principles  and  refused.  So  Anteia 
went  to  King  Proetus  with  a lying  tale.  ‘Proetus,’  she  said,  'Bellerophon  has 
tried  to  ravish  me.  Kill  him— or  die  yourself.’  The  king  was  enraged  when  he 
heard  this  infamous  tale.  He  stopped  short  of  putting  Bellerophon  to  death- 
it  was  a thing  he  dared  not  do-but  he  packed  him  off  to  Lycia  with  sinister 
credentials  from  himself.  He  gave  him  a folded  tablet  on  which  he  had  traced 
a number  of  devices  with  a deadly  meaning,  and  told  him  to  hand  this  to  his 
father-in-law,  the  Lycian  king,  and  thus  ensure  his  own  death 

The  Lycian  king  feasted  Bellerophon  for  nine  days.  “But  the  tenth  day 
came,  and  then,  in  the  first  rosy  light  of  Dawn,  he  examined  him  and  asked 
to  see  what  credentials  he  had  brought  him  from  his  son-in-law  Proetus. 
When  he  had  deciphered  the  fatal  message  from  his  son-in-law,  the  king  s 
first  step  was  to  order  Bellerophon  to  kill  the  Chimera,”  a fire-breathing 
monster  with  a lion’s  head,  a goat’s  body,  and  a serpent  s tail.  Bellerophon 
did  The  Lycian  king  then  tried  one  ruse  after  another  to  carry  out  the  sur- 
reptitious instructions,  but  Bellerophon  successively  battled  the  Solymi 
defeated  the  Amazons,  and  slew  the  best  warriors  of  Lycia,  who  had  ambushed 
him  In  the  end  the  Lycian  king  relented,  realizing  that  the  youth  stood  under 
the  divine  protection  of  the  gods,  and  gave  him  his  daughter  and  half  h.s 

kingdom.

The  First  3,000  Years 

This  is  the  only  mention  of  writing  in  the  Iliad.  Homer’s  language  is  not 
precise  enough  to  tell  exactly  what  the  markings  on  the  tablets  were.  They 
were  probably  nothing  more  than  ordinary  letters — actual  substitution  of 
symbols  for  letters  seems  too  sophisticated  for  the  era  of  the  Trojan  War. 
But  the  mystery  that  Homer  throws  around  the  tablets  does  suggest  that  some 
rudimentary  form  of  concealment  was  used,  perhaps  some  such  allusion  as 
"Treat  this  man  as  well  as  you  did  Glaucus,”  naming  someone  whom  the  king 
had  had  assassinated.  The  whole  tone  of  the  reference  makes  it  fairly  certain 
that  here,  in  the  first  great  literary  work  of  European  culture,  appear  that 
culture’s  first  faint  glimmerings  of  secrecy  in  communication. 

A few  centuries  later,  those  glimmerings  had  become  definite  beams  of 
light.  Several  stories  in  the  Histories  of  Herodotus  deal  specifically  with 
methods  of  steganography  (not,  however,  with  cryptography).  Herodotus  tells 
how  a Median  noble  named  Harpagus  wanted  to  avenge  himself  on  his 
relative,  the  king  of  the  Medes,  who  years  before  had  tricked  him  into  eating 
his  own  son.  So  he  hid  a message  to  a potential  ally  in  the  belly  of  an  un- 
skinned hare,  disguised  a messenger  as  a hunter,  and  sent  him  off  down  the 
road,  carrying  the  hare  as  if  he  had  just  caught  it.  The  road  guards  suspected 
nothing,  and  the  messenger  reached  his  destination.  At  it  was  Cyrus,  king  of 
Persia,  whose  country  was  then  subject  to  Medea  and  who  had  himself  been 
the  target  of  a babyhood  assassination  attempt  by  the  Medean  king.  The 
message  told  him  that  Harpagus  would  work  from  within  to  help  him  de- 
throne the  Medean  king.  Cyrus  needed  no  further  urging.  He  led  the  Persians 
in  revolt;  they  defeated  the  Medes  and  captured  the  king,  and  Cyrus  was  on 
his  way  to  winning  the  epithet  “the  Great.” 

Herodotus  tells  how  another  revolt — this  one  against  the  Persians — was 
set  in  motion  by  one  of  the  most  bizarre  means  of  secret  communication  ever 
recorded.  One  Histiaeus,  wanting  to  send  word  from  the  Persian  court  to  his 
son-in-law,  the  tyrant  Aristagoras  at  Miletus,  shaved  the  head  of  a trusted 
slave,  tattooed  the  secret  message  thereon,  waited  for  a new  head  of  hair  to 
grow,  then  sent  him  off  to  his  son-in-law  with  the  instruction  to  shave  the 
slave’s  head.  When  Aristagoras  had  done  so,  he  read  on  the  slave’s  scalp  the 
message  that  urged  him  to  revolt  against  Persia. 

One  of  the  most  important  messages  in  the  history  of  Western  civilization 
was  transmitted  secretly.  It  gave  to  the  Greeks  the  crucial  information  that 
Persia  was  planning  to  conquer  them.  According  to  Herodotus, 

The  way  they  received  the  news  was  very  remarkable.  Demaratus,  the  son  of 
Ariston,  who  was  an  exile  in  Persia,  was  not,  I imagine — and  as  is  only  natural 
to  suppose — well  disposed  toward  the  Spartans;  so  it  is  open  to  question  whether 
what  he  did  was  inspired  by  benevolence  or  malicious  pleasure.  Anyway,  as  soon 
as  news  reached  him  at  Susa  that  Xerxes  had  decided  upon  the  invasion  of 
Greece,  he  felt  that  he  must  pass  on  the  information  to  Sparta.  As  the  danger  of 
discovery  was  great,  there  was  only  one  way  in  which  he  could  contrive  to  get  the 
message  through:  this  was  by  scraping  the  wax  off  a pair  of  wooden  folding

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


tablets  writing  on  the  wood  underneath  what  Xerxes  intended  to  do  and  then 
“ vSg  .he  L»g=  over  with  wax  again.  In  this  way  the  tablets  being  ap 
patently  blank,  would  cause  no  trouble  with  the  guards  along  the  road.  When  the 
message  reached  its  destination,  no  one  was  able  to  guess  the  secret  until,  a 
understand,  Cleomenes’  daughter  Gorgo,  who  was  the  w.fe  of  Leonidas  d*- 
covered  it  and  told  the  others  that,  if  they  scraped  the  wax  off,  they  would  find 
something  written  on  the  wood  underneath.  This  was  done;  the  message  was 
revealed  and  read,  and  afterwards  passed  on  to  the  other  Greeks. 

The  rest  is  well-known.  Thermopylae,  Salamis,  and  Plataea  ended  the  danger 
that  the  flame  of  Western  civilization  would  be  extinguished  by  an  One 
invasion.  The  story  is  not  without  a certain  bitter  irony,  however,  lor  G rg 
who  may  be  considered  the  first  woman  cryptanalyst,  in  a way  Pr°noanced 
a death  sentence  on  her  own  husband;  Leonidas  died  at  the  head  of  the  heroic 
band  of  Spartans  who  held  off  the  Persians  for  three  crucial  days  at  the  narrow 

PaSIt°lIsht™ Spartans,  the  most  warlike  of  the  Greeks,  who  established  the 
first  system  of  military  cryptography.  As  early  as  the  fifth  century  B.c.  ey 
employed  a device  called  the  “skytale,”  the  earliest  apparatus  used  in  crypto- 
logy and  one  of  the  few  ever  devised  in  the  whole  history  of  the  science  or 

transposition  ciphers.  The  skytale  consists  of  a staff  of  wood  aroun^  1C 
strip  of  papyrus  or  leather  or  parchment  is  wrapped  close-packed.  The  secret 
mesPsageP,swritten  on  the  parchment  down  the  length  of  the  staff;  the  parch 
ment  is  then  unwound  and  sent  on  its  way.  The  disconnected  letters  make  no 
sense  unless  the  parchment  is  rewrapped  around  a baton  of  the  same  thickness 
as  the  first:  then  words  leap  from  loop  to  loop,  forming  the  message. 

Thucydides  tells  how  it  enciphered  a message  from  the  ephors  or  rulers,  of 
Sparta,  ordering  the  too-ambitious  Spartan  prince  and  general  Pausanms  to 
follow  the  herald  back  home  from  where  he  was  trying  to  ally  h‘mse>fJlth  ‘he 
Persians  or  have  war  declared  against  him  by  the  Spartans.  He  went.  That 
was  about  475  b.c.  About  a century  later,  according  to  Plutarch,  another  sky- 
tale message  recalled  another  Spartan  general,  Lysander,  to  face : ^ar| e 
insubordination.  Xenophon  also  records  the  skytale  s use  in  enciphering 
of  names  in  an  order  sent  to  another  Spartan  commander. 

The  world  owes  its  first  instructional  text  on  communications  security 
the  Greeks.  It  appeared  as  an  entire  chapter  in  one  of  the  earliest  works  on 
military  science,  On  the  Defense  of  Fortified  Places,  by  Aeneas  the  Tactic.an. 
He  retold  some  of  Herodotus’  stories,  and  listed  several  systems, 
placed  the  vowels  of  the  plaintext  by  dots-one  dot  for  alpha,  two  for  epsilon 
and  so  on  to  seven  for  omega.  Consonants  remained _ unenc.phered L In t a 
steganographic  system,  holes  representing  the  letters  of  the  Greek  alpha 
were  bored  through  an  astragal  or  a disk.  Then  the  encipherer  passed  yarn 
through  the  holes  that  successively  represented  the  letters  of  h.s  message.  The 
decipherer  would  presumably  have  to  reverse  the  entire  text  after  unraveling 
the  thread.  Another  steganograph.c  system  was  still  in  use  in  the  20th  century . 


83 


The  First  3,000  Years 

Aeneas  suggested  pricking  holes  in  a book  or  other  document  above  or  below 
the  letters  of  the  secret  message.  German  spies  used  this  very  system  in  World 
War  I,  and  used  it  with  a slight  modification  in  World  War  II — dotting  the 
letters  of  newspapers  with  invisible  ink. 

Another  Greek  writer,  Polybius,  devised  a system  of  signaling  that  has 
been  adopted  very  widely  as  a cryptographic  method.  He  arranged  the  letters 
in  a square  and  numbered  the  rows  and  columns.  To  use  the  English  alphabet, 
and  merging  i and  j in  a single  cell  to  fit  the  alphabet  into  a 5 x 5 square: 


Each  letter  may  now  be  represented  by  two  numbers — that  of  its  row  and 
that  of  its  column.  Thus  e = 15,  v = 51.  Polybius  suggested  that  these 
numbers  be  transmitted  by  means  of  torches— one  torch  in  the  right  hand  and 
five  in  the  left  standing  for  e,  for  example.  This  method  could  signal  messages 
over  long  distances.  But  modern  cryptographers  have  found  several  char- 
acteristics of  the  Polybius  square,  or  “checkerboard,”  as  it  is  now  commonly 
called,  exceedingly  valuable — namely,  the  conversion  of  letters  to  numbers, 
the  reduction  in  the  number  of  different  characters,  and  the  division  of  a unit 
into  two  separately  manipulable  parts.  Polybius’  checkerboard  has  therefore 
become  very  widely  used  as  the  basis  of  a number  of  systems  of  encipherment. 

These  Greek  authors  never  said  whether  any  of  the  substitution  ciphers 
they  described  were  actually  used,  and  so  the  first  attested  use  of  that  genre  in 
military  affairs  come  from  the  Romans — and  from  the  greatest  Roman  of  them 
all,  in  fact.  Julius  Caesar  tells  the  story  himself  in  his  Gallic  Wars.  He  had 
proceeded  by  forced  marches  to  the  borders  of  the  Nervii,  and 


There  he  learned  from  prisoners  what  was  taking  place  at  Cicero’s  station, 
and  how  dangerous  was  his  case.  Then  he  persuaded  one  of  the  Gallic  troopers 
with  great  rewards  to  deliver  a letter  to  Cicero.  The  letter  he  sent  written  in  Greek 
characters,  lest  by  intercepting  it  the  enemy  might  get  to  know  of  our  designs. 
The  messenger  was  instructed,  if  he  could  not  approach,  to  hurl  a spear,  with  the 
letter  fastened  to  the  thong,  inside  the  entrenchment  of  the  camp.  In  the  dispatch 
he  wrote  that  he  had  started  with  the  legions  and  would  speedily  be  with  him, 
and  he  exhorted  Cicero  to  maintain  his  old  courage.  Fearing  danger,  the  Gaul 
discharged  the  spear,  as  he  had  been  instructed.  By  chance  it  stuck  fast  in  the 
tower,  and  for  two  days  was  not  sighted  by  our  troops;  on  the  third  day  it  was 
sighted  by  a soldier,  taken  down,  and  delivered  to  Cicero.  He  read  it  through 
and  then  recited  it  at  a parade  of  the  troops,  bringing  the  greatest  rejoicing  to 
all. 


g4  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

The  garrison,  heartened,  held  out  until  Caesar  arrived  and  relieved  them. 

Later,  Caesar  improved  on  this  technique  and,  in  doing  so,  impressed  hts 
name  permanently  into  cryptology  as  he  did  into  so  many  other  fields. 
Suetonius,  the  gossip  columnist  of  ancient  Rome,  says  that  Caesar  wrote  to 
Cicero  and  other  friends  in  a cipher  in  which  the  plaintext  letters  were  replaced 
by  letters  standing  three  places  further  down  the  alphabet,  d for  a,  e for  b, 
etc  Thus  the  message  Omnia  Gallia  est  divisa  in  partes  tres  would  be  en- 
ciphered (using  the  modern  26-letter  alphabet)  to  rpqld  jdoold  hvw 
glylvd  lq  sduwhv  wuhv.  To  this  day,  any  cipher  alphabet  that  consists  of 
the  standard  sequence,  like  Caesar’s: 

plain  abcdef  gh  i jk  lmnopqr  s t uvwxyz 

cipher  defghi  j klmnopqRSTUVW  xyzabc 

is  called  a Caesar  alphabet,  even  if  it  begins  with  a letter  other  than  D. 
A later  writer,  Aulus  Gellius,  seems  to  imply  that  Caesar  sometimes  used  more 
complicated  systems.  But  Caesar’s  nephew  Augustus,  first  emperor  of  Rome 
and  less  able  than  his  uncle  in  a number  of  ways,  also  employed  a weaker 
cipher  “When  Augustus  wrote  in  cipher,”  said  Suetonius,  “he  simply  sub- 
stituted the  next  letter  of  the  alphabet  for  the  one  required,  except  that  he 
wrote  aa  for  x”  (the  last  letter  of  the  Roman  alphabet). 

Cryptography  seems  to  have  been  not  at  all  uncommon  in  the  Roman 
state  Suetonius’s  phraseology  implies  that  the  two  Caesars  employed  it 
habitually  and  not  on  a single  isolated  occasion.  Cicero  used  sampsiceramus 
and  arabarches  and  hierosolymarius  as  mocking  codenames  for  Pompey ; 
they  all  allude  to  persons  and  places  of  importance  in  Pompey’s  career.  Many 
Latin  writers  mention  rudimentary  forms  of  secret  communication.  A gram- 
marian named  Probus,  probably  Valerius  Probus,  even  wrote  a treatise  on 
the  ciphers  of  Julius  Caesar;  this  has  not  survived,  and  is  the  first  of  several 
Lost  Books  of  Cryptology. 

It  must  be  that  as  soon  as  a culture  has  reached  a certain  level,  probably 
measured  largely  by  its  literacy,  cryptography  appears  spontaneously-as  its 
parents,  language  and  writing,  probably  also  did.  The  multiple  human  needs 
and  desires  that  demand  privacy  among  two  or  more  people  in  the  midst  o 
social  life  must  inevitably  lead  to  cryptology  wherever  men  thrive  and 
wherever  they  write.  Cultural  diffusion  seems  a less  likely  explanation  for  its 
occurrence  in  so  many  areas,  many  of  them  distant  and  isolated. 

The  Yezidis,  an  obscure  sect  of  about  25.000  people  in  northern  Iraq,  use 
a cryptic  script  in  their  holy  books  because  they  fear  persecution  by  then 
Moslem  neighbors.  Tibetans  use  a kind  of  cipher  called  “rin-spuns  for  official 
correspondence;  it  is  named  for  its  inventor  Rin-c’(hhen-)spuns(-pa),  who 
lived  in  the  1300s.  The  Nsibidi  secret  society  of  Nigeria  keeps  its  pictograp  ic 
script  from  Europeans  as  much  as  possible  because  it  is  used  chiefly  to  express 
love  in  rather  direct  imagery,  and  samples  appear  to  be  at  least  as  porno-

graphic  as  they  are  cryptographic.  The  cryptography  of  Thailand  developed 
under  Indian  influence.  An  embryonic  study  of  the  subject  even  appears  in  a 
grammatical  work  entitled  Poranavakya  by  Hluang  Prasot  Aksaraniti  (Phe). 
One  system,  called  “the  erring  Siamese,”  substitutes  one  delicate  Siamese 
letter  for  another.  In  another  system,  consonants  are  divided  into  seven 
groups  of  five  letters;  a letter  is  indicated  by  writing  the  Siamese  number  of  its 
group  and  placing  vertical  dots  under  it  equal  in  number  to  the  letter’s  place 
in  its  group.  A system  called  “the  hermit  metamorphosing  letters”  writes  the 
text  backwards.

As  isolated  an  area  as  the  Maidive  Islands  in  the  Indian  Ocean  uses  two 
kinds  of  secret  writing.  “Harha  tana”  involves  reciprocal  substitution  be- 
tween consecutive  letters  of  their  alphabet,  the  “gabuli  tana,”  so  that  h =rh 
and  rh  = h,  and  so  forth,  the  first  equivalent  perhaps  giving  rise  to  the  name 
of  the  system.  “De-fa  tana”  effects  substitutions  between  the  halves  of  the 
gabuli  tana.  In  Malaya,  natives  call  their  cryptographic  alphabet  the  “gangga 
malayu";  it  consists  of  the  slightly  altered  or  inverted  characters  of  the 
Malayan  Arabic  alphabet,  with  some  Javanese  marks.  In  Armenia  in  the  16th

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


century,  two  scribes  employed  a Polybius-like  checkerboard  to  inject  an  air  of 
special  hidden  knowledge  into  religious  texts;  a third  composed  his  ciphertext 
by  writing  two  letters  whose  numerical  value  equaled  that  of  the  plaintext 
letter — z,  with  value  6,  became  gg,  each  g having  a value  3. 

Persia,  in  the  first  half-millennium  after  Christ,  apparently  made  use  of 
cryptography  for  political  purposes.  A chronicler  mentioned  a “script  called 
‘shah-dabiriya,’  and  the  kings  of  the  Persians  used  to  speak  it  among  them- 
selves to  the  exclusion  of  commoners  and  prevent  the  rest  of  the  people  of  the 
kingdom  from  [learning]  it  for  fear  that  one  who  was  not  a king  should  dis- 
cover the  secrets  of  the  kings.”  He  also  referred  to  “another  script  called  ‘raz- 
sahriya,  in  which  the  kings  used  to  write  secrets  [in  correspondence]  with 
those  of  other  nations  that  they  wished,  and  the  number  of  its  consonants  and 
vowels  is  forty,  and  each  of  the  consonants  and  vowels  has  a known  form, 
and  there  is  no  trace  in  it  of  the  Nabataean  language.”  Though  the  historian 
gave  no  examples,  a 10th-century  compiler  of  a handbook  for  secretaries,  in 
setting  down  two  monalphabetic  substitutions,  said  that  they  were  of  Persian 
origin.  One  substituted  the  names  of  birds  for  the  letters  of  the  alphabet.  The 
other  equated  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  with  the  names  of  the  28  astronomical 
lunar  mansions:  the  two  horns  of  the  ram,  the  ram’s  belly,  the  Pleiades,  and 
so  on. 

At  the  Coptic  monastery  of  St.  Jeremias  in  Saqqara,  Egypt,  perhaps  just 
before  it  was  abandoned  late  in  the  sixth  century  a.d.,  a man  enciphered  a 
message  in  monalphabetic  substitution  and  scratched  it  on  the  wall  inside 
the  door  to  a courtyard  in  a curious  bid  for  immortality.  “In  the  name  of  God 
before  all  things,”  the  inscription  calls  out  beseechingly  across  the  centuries, 
“I,  Victor,  the  humble  poor  man — remember  me.”  Victor's  encipherment  of 
his  plea  gave  him  his  wish.  At  the  site  of  another  Coptic  monastery,  the 
seventh-century  one  of  Epiphanius  at  Sheikh-abd-el-Gourna  in  southern 
Egypt,  there  was  found  an  unusual  object  in  the  cell  of  a priest  named  Elias. 

It  was  a dried-out  piece  of  wood  about  a foot  long  and  four  inches  high, 
bearing  two  lines  of  writing  in  black  ink.  The  top  line  is  a slightly  garbled 
verse  in  Greek,  notable  not  for  its  beauty  but  because  it  includes  all  the  letters 
of  the  Coptic  Greek  alphabet.  It  spills  over  for  five  letters  into  the  bottom 
line,  which  contains  21  letters  of  that  alphabet,  divided  into  four  unequal 
sections  that  are  reversed  and  shuffled.  How  Priest  Elias  used  it  is  not  known, 
but  it  does  seem  fairly  certain  that  this  wooden  tablet,  now  in  the  Metropoli- 
tan Museum  of  Art  in  New  York,  is  the  oldest  surviving  cipher  key  (as 
distinguished  from  the  codelike  cuneiform  tablets)  in  the  world. 

The  hardy  plant  of  cryptography  sprouted  not  only  in  these  sunblasted 
climes  but  also  in  the  damp,  chill  lands  to  the  north.  Two  non-Latin  scripts  of 
Europe,  Teutonic  runes  and  Celtic  oghams,  were  occasionally  enciphered. 

Runes  flourished  in  Scandinavia  and  in  Anglo-Saxon  Britain  during  the 
seventh,  eighth,  and  ninth  centuries.  They  were  nearly  always  used  for  religious 
purposes.  A stark,  angular  script,  its  alphabet  was  divided  into  three  groups 


The  13-foot-high  Rok  stone  of  Sweden , covered  with  enciphered  runes 


of  eight  runic  letters  each.  The  letter  thorn,  for  example,  which  looked  some- 
what like  a modern  p and  represented  the  initial  sounds  of  “thin”  and  “then,” 
was  the  third  letter  of  the  first  group.  All  systems  of  runic  cryptography 
replaced  runic  letters  by  groups  of  marks  indicating  the  number  of  a letter’s 


88 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


group  and  the  number  of  its  place  in  that  group.  Isruna  used  the  short  i rune, 
a short  vertical  stroke  named  “is,”  to  give  the  number  of  the  group,  and  the 
long  i rune  to  give  the  place  number.  Thus  thorn — group  1,  letter  3 — would 
be  replaced  by  a single  short  vertical  mark  and  three  longer  vertical  marks. 
Another  system  of  runic  cryptography,  hahalruna,  attached  diagonal  strokes 
representing  these  numbers  to  a vertical  shaft,  putting  the  group  marks  on  the 
left,  the  place  marks  on  the  right.  Sometimes  shafts  were  crossed.  Other 
variations  on  this  theme  were  lagoruna,  stopfruna,  and  clopfruna.  Crypto- 
graphic runes  occur  in  many  places,  most  profusely  on  the  Rok  stone,  a 13- 
foot-high  slab  of  granite  standing  at  the  western  end  of  the  Rok  churchyard 
in  Sweden.  It  includes  among  its  more  than  770  runic  letters  a veritable 
catalog  of  runic  cryptography.

Three  forms  of  enciphered  ogham:  head  of  quarreling,  interwoven,  and  well-footed 
ogham  as  shown  in  the  “ Book  of  Ballymote ” 


Ogham  survives  chiefly  in  inscriptions  on  tombstones.  Its  alphabet  con- 
sists of  five  groups  of  five  letters,  represented  by  one  to  five  lines  extending 
away  from  a horizontal  line.  In  the  first  group,  the  lines  extend  above  the 
horizontal  line;  in  the  second  group,  below  it;  in  the  third,  perpendicularly 
above  and  below;  in  the  fourth,  diagonally  above  and  below;  the  fifth  group 
is  heterogeneous.  Methods  for  enciphering  them  are  catalogued  in  the  “Book 
of  Ballymote,”  a 1 5th-century  compilation  of  historical,  genealogical,  and 
other  facts  of  importance. 

The  most  delightful  thing  about  these  systems  is  their  names,  the  most 
charming  in  cryptology,  which  have  been  bestowed  with  all  the  Irish  flair  for 
poetry,  blarney,  and  wit.  There  is,  for  an  example,  a system  called  “the  ogham 
that  bewildered  Bres,”  in  which  the  name  of  the  letter  stands  for  the  letter,  as 
if  one  were  to  encipher  who  as  double-you  aitch  oh.  The  name  comes  from  a 
story  that  a message  thus  concealed  was  given  to  the  ancient  hero  Bres  as  he 
was  going  into  battle,  and  so  confused  him  by  its  complications  that  he  lost  the 
battle  while  trying  to  figure  it  out.  “Sanctuary  ogham”  puts  a stroke  between 


89

every  pair  of  letters.  “Serpent  through  the  heather”  runs  a wavy  line  above 
and  below  the  successive  letters.  “Great  speckle”  has  a single  mark  of 
appropriate  slant  and  length  for  the  letter,  followed  by  as  many  dots,  less  one, 
as  there  are  strokes  in  the  letter.  In  “twinned  ogham”  each  letter  is  doubled; 
in  “host  ogham,”  tripled.  “Vexation  of  a poet’s  heart”  reduces  the  lines  to 
short  marks  extending  beyond  an  empty  rectangle.  In  “point  against  eye,”  the 
alphabet  is  reversed.  In  “fraudulent  ogham”  the  letters  are  replaced  by 
symbols  one  step  further  on.  And  a system  in  which  the  chaotic  order  of  the 
substitutes  seems  to  have  resulted  from  an  infuriated  Irishman’s  knocking 
them  about  with  a shillelagh  is  called  “outburst  of  rage  ogham.”  Probably 
none  of  these  ever  actually  enciphered  ogham.  They  seem  to  have  been  just 
dreamed  up  for  fun.  But  the  bottom  of  one  of  the  pages  of  the  “Book  of 
Ballymote”  is  written  in  another  system  called  “Bricriu’s  ogham.”  With  some 
emendation,  it  can  be  interpreted  as  a fragment  of  an  ancient  Druidic  liturgy 
—probably  the  only  one  known  to  the  modern  world,  and,  fittingly,  the  only 
place  in  which  enciphered  oghams  were  ever  used. 

In  the  Europe  of  the  Latin  alphabet— from  which  modern  cryptology 
would  spring — cryptography  flickered  weakly.  With  the  collapse  of  the  Roman 
empire,  Europe  had  plunged  into  the  obscurity  of  the  Dark  Ages.  Literacy  had 
all  but  disappeared.  Arts  and  sciences  were  forgotten,  and  cryptography  was 
not  excepted.  Only  during  the  Middle  Ages  occasional  manuscripts,  with  an 
infrequent  signature  or  gloss  or  “deo  gratias  that  a bored  monk  put  into 
cipher  to  amuse  himself,  fitfully  illuminate  the  cryptologic  darkness,  and,  like 
a single  candle  guttering  in  a great  medieval  hall,  their  feeble  flarings  only 
emphasize  the  gloom. 

The  systems  used  were  simple  in  the  extreme.  Phrases  were  written  vertic- 
ally or  backwards;  dots  were  substituted  for  vowels;  foreign  alphabets,  as 
Greek,  Hebrew,  and  Armenian,  were  used;  each  letter  of  the  plaintext  was 
replaced  by  the  one  that  follows  it;  in  the  most  advanced  system,  special  signs 
substituted  for  letters.  For  almost  a thousand  years,  from  before  500  to  1400, 
the  cryptology  of  Western  civilization  stagnated.  An  “advanced"  system  is  as 
likely  to  appear  in  the  600s  as  in  the  1400s — though  the  really  simple  systems 
do  fade  away  by  the  end  of  the  period. 

A few  names  glimmer  through  the  mists.  Tradition  attributes  to  St. 
Boniface,  the  Anglo-Saxon  missionary  who  founded  monasteries  in  Germany 
in  the  eighth  century,  the  importation  to  the  continent  of  cryptographic 
puzzles  based  on  a dots-for-vowels  system.  The  brilliant  monk  Gerbert,  who 
reigned  as  Pope  Sylvester  II  from  999  to  1003  and  whose  learning  became 
legendary,  kept  notes  in  a syllabic  system  called  “tyronian  notes,  a shorthand 
reputedly  developed  by  Tullius  Tyro,  a freed  slave  of  Cicero  s.  He  even  wrote 
his  name  in  it  on  two  of  his  bulls.  Hildegard  von  Bingen,  an  1 lth-century  nun 
who  saw  apocalyptic  visions  and  was  later  canonized,  had  a cipher  alphabet 
which  she  claimed  came  to  her  in  a flash  of  inspiration.  In  the  early  800s,  an 
Irishman  named  Dubthach  concocted  a cryptogram  while  at  the  castle  of  the

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


king  of  Wales  as  a kind  of  malicious  IQ  test  for  visiting  compatriots.  He 
apparently  wanted  to  embarrass  them  in  revenge  for  some  humiliation  he  had 
suffered  at  home,  and  was  confident  that  “no  Irish  scholar,  much  less 
British,”  would  be  able  to  read  it.  But  four  clever  sons  of  Eire — Cauncho- 
brach,  Fergus,  Domminnach,  and  Suadbar — turned  the  tables  on  him  by 
solving  the  cryptogram,  which  consisted  of  a short  Latin  plaintext  written  in 
Greek  letters.  Then  they  prudently  sent  the  answer  back  to  their  teacher, 
urging  him  to  “give  this  information  to  such  of  our  simple  and  unsophisti- 
cated Irish  brethren  as  may  think  of  sailing  across  the  British  sea,  lest  per- 
chance otherwise  they  might  be  made  to  blush  in  the  presence  of  Mermin,  the 
glorious  king  of  the  Britons,  not  being  able  to  understand  that  inscription.” 

The  only  writer  of  the  Middle  Ages  to  describe  cryptography  instead  of

A cryptogram  composed  and  written  by  Geoffrey  Chaucer 

just  using  it  was  Roger  Bacon,  the  English  monk  of  startlingly  modern 
speculations.  In  his  Epistle  on  the  Secret  Works  of  Art  and  the  Nullity  of 
Magic , written  about  the  middle  of  the  1200s,  Bacon  stated:  “A  man  is  crazy 
who  writes  a secret  in  any  other  way  than  one  which  will  conceal  it  from  the 
vulgar,”  and  then  listed  seven  deliberately  vague  methods  of  doing  so.  Among 
them  are  the  use  of  consonants  only,  figurate  expressions,  letters  from  exotic 
alphabets,  invented  characters,  shorthand,  and  “magic  figures  and  spells.” 

Far  and  away  the  most  famous  of  all  those  who  had  an  acquaintance  with 
cryptology  in  the  Middle  Ages  was  an  English  customs  official,  amateur 
astronomer,  and  literary  genius  named  Geoffrey  Chaucer.  In  a work  called 
The  Equatorie  of  the  P/anetis,  which  describes  the  workings  of  an  astronomical 
instrument  and  which  appears  to  be  a companion  piece  to  his  Treatise  on  the 
Astrolabe,  Chaucer  included  six  short  passages  in  cipher.  He  enciphered  them 
with  a symbol  alphabet  in  which,  for  example,  a is  represented  by  a sign 


91 


The  First  3,000  Years 

resembling  a capital  V and  b by  one  looking  like  a script  alpha.  One  passage 
reads : “This  table  servith  for  to  entre  in  to  the  table  of  equacion  of  the  mone 
on  either  side.”  The  encipherments  give  simplified  directions  for  using  the 
equatorie— never  mind  about  the  complicated  technical  explanation,  just  do 
this  and  that  and  the  answer  comes  out  right.  The  cryptograms  are  in  Chaucer’s 
own  hand,  making  them  some  of  the  most  illustrious  encipherments  in  history. 

During  all  these  years,  cryptology  was  acquiring  a taint  that  lingers  even 
today— the  conviction  in  the  minds  of  many  people  that  cryptology  is  a black 
art,  a form  of  occultism  whose  practitioner  must,  in  William  F.  Friedman’s 
apt  phrase,  “perforce  commune  daily  with  dark  spirits  to  accomplish  his  feats 
of  mental  jiu-jitsu.” 

In  part  it  is  a kind  of  guilt  by  association.  From  the  early  days  of  its 
existence,  cryptology  had  served  to  obscure  critical  portions  of  writings  deal- 
ing with  the  potent  subject  of  magic— divinations,  spells,  curses,  whatever 
conferred  supernatural  powers  on  its  sorcerers.  The  first  faint  traces  of  this 
appeared  in  Egyptian  cryptography.  Plutarch  reported  that  “sundry  very 
ancient  oracles  were  kept  in  secret  writings  by  the  priests”  at  Delphi.  And 
before  the  fall  of  the  Roman  empire,  secret  writing  was  serving  as  a powerful 
ally  of  the  necromancers  in  guarding  their  art  from  the  profane. 

One  of  the  most  famous  magic  manuscripts,  the  so-called  Leiden  papyrus, 
discovered  at  Thebes  and  written  in  the  third  century  a.d.  in  both  Greek  and 
a very  late  form  of  demotic,  a highly  simplified  version  of  hieroglyphics, 
employs  cipher  to  conceal  the  crucial  portions  of  important  recipes.  For 
example,  in  a section  telling  how  to  give  a man  an  incurable  skin  disease,  the 
papyrus  uses  secret  signs  to  encipher  the  words  for  “skin  disease  and  the 
names  of  the  lizards:  “You  wish  to  produce  a skin-disease  on  a man  and  that 
it  shall  not  be  healed,  a hantous- lizard  and  a hafleele- lizard,  you  cook  them 
with  oil,  you  wash  the  man  with  them.”  The  plaintext  in  most  of  the  cipher 
sections  (including  one  telling  how  to  make  a woman  desire  a man,  which 
doesn’t  work)  is  in  Greek,  and  the  cipher  alphabet  consists  basically  of 
Greek  letter  signs.  Cryptology  served  magical  purposes  frequently  throughout 
the  Middle  Ages,  and  even  in  the  Renaissance  was  still  disguising  important 
parts  of  alchemical  formulas.  A manuscript  compiled  at  Naples  between  1473 
and  1490  by  Arnaldus  de  Bruxella  uses  five  lines  of  cipher  to  conceal  the 
crucial  part  of  the  operation  of  making  a philosopher’s  stone. 

The  association  of  magic  and  cryptology  was  reinforced  by  other  factors. 
Mysterious  symbols  were  used  in  such  esoteric  fields  as  astrology  and 
alchemy — -where  each  planet  and  chemical  had  a special  sign,  like  the  circle 
and  arrow  for  Mars — just  as  they  were  in  cryptology.  Like  words  in  cipher, 
spells  and  incantations,  such  as  “abracadabra,"  looked  like  nonsense  but  in 
reality  were  potent  with  hidden  meanings. 

A very  important  factor  was  the  confusion  of  cryptology  with  the  Jewish 
kabbalah,  a mystical  philosophy  that  also  interested  many  Christians  of  an 


92 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

occultistic  turn  of  mind.  One  of  its  basic  tenets  was  that  language,  which 
comes  from  God,  reflects  the  fundamental  spiritual  nature  of  the  world,  and 
so  expresses  creation  itself.  Kabbalists  thus  produced  new  revelations  about 
existence  by  wringing  hidden  meanings  from  every  word,  every  letter,  even 
every  vowel  point  and  accent  mark  in  the  Torah.  “Truth,”  they  would  say, 
stands  more  firmly  than  falsehood” — an  assertion  based  on  the  fact  that  the 
letters  of  the  Hebrew  word  for  “falsehood”  all  balance  precariously  on  one 
leg,  somewhat  like  an  English  r,  whereas  those  of  the  word  for  “truth”  all  rest 
solidly  on  two  feet,  like  h.  Among  their  devices  was  gematria,  which  gave  the 
letters  of  Hebrew  words  their  numerical  values,  added  them  up,  and  then 
interpreted  the  result,  often  by  comparing  it  with  other  words  having  the  same 
total.  For  example,  Genesis  14:14  says  that  Abraham  came  to  the  aid  of  his 
nephew  Lot  with  318  servants.  But  318  is  the  numerical  value  of  the  name  of 
Abraham’s  servant,  Eliezer.  Hence  the  318  were  really  only  one— Eliezer. 
Less  important  than  gematria  were  notarikon,  which  regarded  the  letters  of 
words  as  abbreviations  for  whole  sentences,  and  temurah,  an  interchange  of 
letters  according  to  various  rules,  including  atbash.  These  practices  work 
upon  the  same  raw  material  as  cryptology,  but  unlike  cryptology  they  are 
flexible  and  speculative.  Some  of  their  laxness  seemed  to  infect  cryptology, 
while  their  mystical  pronouncements  seemed  to  add  further  magical  elements. 

Later  writers  boasted  of  their  ability  to  solve  ciphers  in  the  same  breath 
that  they  bragged  of  their  prowess  in  recording  human  voices,  in  telepathy, 
and  in  communicating  with  people  far  underground  or  miles  away.  One 
influential  writer,  an  abbot  who  believed  in  magic,  then  under  condemnation 
by  the  church,  wrote  about  it  under  the  guise  of  the  more  innocuous  crypto- 
logy — and  thus  intensified  the  association  between  them.  Later  writers 
discussed  the  two  together  either  because  they  believed  they  went  together  or 
to  impress  their  readers  with  their  own  dread  powers.  Much  of  this  super- 
natural claptrap  besmirched  cryptology. 

But,  important  as  all  these  were,  the  view  that  cryptology  is  black 
magic  in  itself  springs  ultimately  from  a superficial  resemblance  between 
cryptology  and  divination.  Extracting  an  intelligible  message  from  ciphertext 
seemed  to  be  exactly  the  same  thing  as  obtaining  knowledge  by  examining  the 
flight  of  birds,  the  location  of  stars  and  planets,  the  length  and  intersections 
of  lines  in  the  hand,  the  entrails  of  sheep,  the  position  of  dregs  in  a teacup.  In 
all  of  these,  the  wizardlike  operator  draws  sense  from  grotesque,  unfamiliar, 
and  apparently  meaningless  signs.  He  makes  known  the  unknown.  Of  course 
the  analogy  errs.  Augury,  astrology,  palmistry,  haruspication,  and  the  other 
divinatory  techniques  are  all  ultimately  subjective  and  invalid,  while  crypto- 
logy is  objective  and  perfectly  valid.  Nevertheless,  the  appearance  often  over- 
whelmed this  reality.  The  simpleminded  saw  magic  even  in  ordinary  decipher- 
ing. Others,  more  sophisticated,  saw  it  in  cryptanalysis,  whose  drawing  the 
veil  from  something  concealed  and  buried  seemed  to  them  both  mysterious 
and  miraculous.  They  equated  cryptology  and  magic. 


93 


The  First  3,000  Years 

All  this  stained  cryptology  so  deeply  with  the  dark  hues  of  esoterism  that 
some  of  them  still  persist,  noticeably  coloring  the  public  image  of  cryptology. 
People  still  think  cryptanalysis  mysterious.  Book  dealers  still  list  cryptology 
under  “occult.”  And  in  1940  the  United  States  conferred  upon  its  Japanese 
diplomatic  cryptanalyses  the  codename  magic. 

In  none  of  the  secret  writing  thus  far  explored  has  there  been  any  sustained 
cryptanalysis.  Occasional  isolated  instances  occurred,  as  that  of  the  four 
Irishmen,  or  Daniel,  or  any  Egyptians  who  may  have  puzzled  out  some  of  the 
hieroglyphic  tomb  inscriptions.  But  of  any  science  of  cryptanalysis,  there  was 
nothing.  Only  cryptography  existed.  And  therefore  cryptology,  which  involves 
both  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis,  had  not  yet  come  into  being  so  far  as 
all  these  cultures — including  the  Western — were  concerned. 

Cryptology  was  born  among  the  Arabs.  They  were  the  first  to  discover  and 
write  down  the  methods  of  cryptanalysis.  The  people  that  exploded  out  of 
Arabia  in  the  600s  and  flamed  over  vast  areas  of  the  known  world  swiftly 
engendered  one  of  the  highest  civilizations  that  history  had  yet  seen.  Science 
flowered.  Arab  medicine  and  mathematics  became  the  best  in  the  world — 
from  the  latter,  in  fact,  comes  the  word  “cipher.”  Practical  arts  flourished. 
Administrative  techniques  developed.  The  exuberant  creative  energies  of  such 
a culture,  excluded  by  its  religion  from  painting  or  sculpture,  and  inspired  by 
it  to  an  explication  of  the  Holy  Koran,  poured  into  literary  pursuits.  Story- 
telling, exemplified  by  Scheherazade’s  Thousand  and  One  Nights,  word- 
riddles,  rebuses,  puns,  anagrams,  and  similar  games  abounded;  grammar 
became  a major  study.  And  included  was  secret  writing. 

Their  interest  appeared  early.  In  the  Arabic  year  241,  which  is  855,*  the 
scholar  Abu  Bakr  Ahmad  ben  ‘All  ben  Wahshiyya  an-Nabati  included  several 
traditional  cipher  alphabets  used  for  magic  in  his  book  Kitab  shauq  al- 
mustahamfi  ma‘rifat  rumuz  al-aqlam  (“Book  of  the  Frenzied  Devotee’s  Desire 
to  Learn  About  the  Riddles  of  Ancient  Scripts”).  One  alphabet,  called 
“dawoudi,”  meaning  “Davidian,”  from  the  name  of  the  king  of  Israel,  was 
developed  from  Hebrew  letters  by  changes  in  cursive  form,  by  adding  tails  to 
letters,  or  by  dropping  parts  of  them.  The  copyist  in  1076  of  a treatise  on 
magic  operations  enciphered  such  words  as  “opium”  in  dawoudi.  It  was 
considered  the  magic  alphabet  par  excellence,  and  was  sometimes  called 
“rihani,”  a form  of  a word  meaning  “magic.”  Another  classic  substitution 
alphabet  survived  as  late  as  1775,  when  it  was  used  in  a spy  letter  to  the 
regent  of  Algiers.  This  script  was  known  in  Turkey  as  “Misirli”  (“Egyptian”), 
in  Egypt  as  “Sham!”  (“Syrian”),  and  in  Syria  as  “Tadmuri”  (“Palmyrene”). 
In  a manuscript  on  the  art  of  war,  probably  of  14th-century  Egyptian  origin, 
cipher  concealed  the  crucial  ingredients  of  compounds  to  be  hurled  into 
besieged  strongholds.  Extremist  sects  in  Islam  cultivated  cryptography  to 
conceal  their  writings  from  the  orthodox. 

In  rare  cases,  the  Moslem  states  used  ciphers — not  codes,  which  they  seem 
* Unless  otherwise  noted,  all  dates  are  a.d.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


not  to  have  known — for  political  purposes,  perhaps  deriving  this  practice 
from  the  Persian  empire,  upon  which  they  modeled  much  of  their  administra- 
tion. A few  documents  with  ciphertext  survive  from  the  Ghaznavid  govern- 
ment of  conquered  Persia,  and  one  chronicler  reports  that  high  officials  were 
supplied  with  a personal  cipher  before  setting  out  for  new  posts.  But  the 
general  lack  of  continuity  of  Islamic  states  and  the  consequent  failure  to 
develop  a permanent  civil  service  and  to  set  up  permanent  embassies  in  other 
countries  militated  against  cryptography’s  more  widespread  use.  Arabic

The  Arabic  “Davidian”  substitution  cipher 


writers  occasionally  allude  to  it.  A genealogical  tract  said  of  an  eighth- 
century  secretary,  Mullul  ben  Ibrahim  ben  Yahza  as-Sanhagi,  that  “he  was 
eloquent  and  quickly  understood  divers  languages;  he  wrote  in  Syriac 
[perhaps  meaning  the  classical  Shami  cipher  alphabet]  and  in  secret  characters 
etc.,  and  he  excelled  in  this.”  The  monumental  survey  of  history  written  in 
Egypt  in  the  14th  century  by  ‘Abd  al-Rahman  Ibn  Khaldun,  The  Muqaddimah, 
which  Arnold  Toynbee  has  called  “undoubtedly  the  greatest  work  of  its  kind 
that  has  ever  yet  been  created  by  any  mind  in  any  time  or  place,”  noted  that 
officials  of  the  governmental  tax  and  army  bureaus  “use  a very  special  code 
among  themselves,  which  is  like  a puzzle.  It  makes  use  of  the  names  of 
perfumes,  fruits,  birds,  or  flowers  to  indicate  the  letters,  or  it  makes  use  of 
forms  different  from  the  accepted  forms  of  the  letters.  Such  a code  is  agreed 
upon  by  the  correspondents  between  themselves,  in  order  to  be  able  to  convey 


The  First  3,000  Years 


95 


their  thoughts  in  writing.”  The  names  of  the  birds  recalls  the  Persian  system 
that  also  used  them,  and  points  to  a Persian  origin  for  at  least  this  cipher,  and 
by  implication  for  others. 

The  special  cryptography  of  the  tax  officials,  called  “qirmeh,”  simplified 
the  forms  of  the  Arabic  letters,  reduced  the  size  of  their  bodies  and  elongated 
their  tails,  dropped  diacritic  points,  ran  words  together  and  sometimes  super- 
imposed or  intermingled  them,  and  abbreviated  many  words.  It  first  appeared 
in  Egypt  in  the  16th  century,  and  most  of  the  financial  records  in  Istanbul, 
Syria,  and  Egypt  until  the  latter  part  of  the  19th  century  were  written  in 
qirmeh.  It  was  used  only  in  documents  pertaining  to  tax  affairs,  in  order  to 
keep  revenue  information  secret. 

The  Arabic  knowledge  of  cryptography  was  fully  set  forth  in  the  section 
on  cryptology  in  the  Subh  al-a  ‘ sha , an  enormous,  14-volume  encyclopedia 
written  to  afford  the  secretary  class  a systematic  survey  of  all  the  important 
branches  of  knowledge.  It  was  completed  in  1412  and  succeeded  in  its  task. 
Its  author,  who  lived  in  Egypt,  was  Shihab  al-Din  abu  ‘l-'Abbas  Ahmad  ben 
‘ Ali  ben  Ahmad  ‘Abd  Allah  al-Qalqashandi.  The  cryptologic  section,  “Con- 
cerning the  concealment  of  secret  messages  within  letters,”  has  two  parts,  one 
dealing  with  symbolic  actions  and  allusions,  the  other  with  invisible  inks  and 
cryptology.  The  section  falls  under  a larger  heading,  “On  the  technical  pro- 
cedures used  in  correspondence  by  the  secretaries  in  eastern  and  western 
lands  and  in  the  Egyptian  territories,  ranging  over  the  whole  period  from  the 
appearance  of  Islam  up  to  our  own  time,”  which,  in  turn,  is  within  a unit 
headed  “On  the  forms  of  correspondence.” 

Qalqashandi  attributed  most  of  his  information  on  cryptology  to  the 
writings  of  Taj  ad-Din  ‘All  ibn  ad-Duraihim  ben  Muhammad  ath-Tha‘alibi  al- 
Mausili,  who  lived  from  1312  to  1361  and  held  various  teaching  and  official 
posts  under  the  Mamelukes  in  Syria  and  Egypt.  Except  for  a theological 
treatise,  none  of  his  writings  is  extant,  but  he  is  reported  to  have  authored  two 
works  on  cryptology.  One  was  a poem,  “Urjuza  fi  ‘1-mutarjam,”  in  a loose 
meter  often  used  for  didactic  poems  and  perhaps  chosen  for  mnemonic 
purposes.  The  other  work  consisted  of  a prose  commentary  on  the  poem 
“Miftah  al-kunuz  fi  Idah  al-marmuz."  Though  this  must  be  included  among 
the  Lost  Books  of  cryptology,  most  of  its  information  was  probably  preserved 
in  Qalqashandi. 

Qalqashandi  began  by  explaining  that  necessity  sometimes  compels 
concealment  “because  an  enemy  places  some  obstacle  or  similar  thing  between 
the  sender  and  the  addressee,  e.g.,  between  two  rulers  or  two  other  persons. 
[It  is  used]  when  circumventory  actions  are  of  no  avail,  either  because  of 
interceptory  ambushes  or  because  of  thorough  probes  into  all  letters  coming 
from  either  of  the  two  parties  corresponding” — the  latter  remark  a significant 
revelation  of  the  need  for  cryptography  and  of  the  probable  practice  of 
cryptanalysis. 

After  explaining  that  one  may  write  in  an  unknown  language  to  obtain

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


secrecy,  Ibn  ad-Duraihim,  according  to  Qalqashandi,  gave  seven  systems  of 
cipher:  (1)  One  letter  may  replace  another.  (2)  The  cryptographer  may  write 
a word  backward.  Muhammad  (in  the  consonantal  Arabic  alphabet)  would 
become  dmhm.  (3)  He  may  reverse  alternate  letters  of  the  words  of  a message. 
(4)  He  may  give  the  letters  their  numerical  value  in  the  system  in  which  the 
Arabic  letters  are  used  as  numbers,  and  then  write  this  value  in  Arabic 
numerals.  Muhammad  becomes  40  + 8 +40+4,  and  the  cryptogram  looks  like 
a list  of  figures.  (5)  The  cryptographer  may  replace  each  plaintext  letter  with 
two  Arabic  letters,  whose  numerical  value  adds  up  to  the  numerical  value  of 
the  plaintext  letter.  After  giving  some  examples,  Qalqashandi  states  that 
“other  letters  can  be  used,  so  long  as  they  add  up  to  the  number  of  the 
original  letter.”  (6)  “He  may  substitute  for  each  letter  the  name  of  a man  or 
something  like  that.”  (7)  The  cryptographer  may  employ  the  lunar  mansions 
as  substitutes  for  the  letters,  or  list  the  names  of  countries,  fruits,  trees,  etc., 
in  a certain  order,  or  draw  birds  or  other  living  creatures,  or  simply  invent 
special  symbols  as  ciphertext  replacements.  The  similarity  of  this  list  to  Ibn 
Khaldun’s  suggests  that  both  writers  took  their  information  from  a 10th- 
century  manual  for  secretaries  by  Abu  Bakr  Muhammad  ben  Yahya  as-Suli, 
who  gave  both  the  bird  and  lunar  substitutions,  reporting  that  they  are 
Persian  in  origin. 

This  list  encompassed,  for  the  first  time  in  cryptography,  both  transposi- 
tion and  substitution  systems,  and,  moreover,  gave,  in  system  5,  the  first 
cipher  ever  to  provide  more  than  one  substitute  for  a plaintext  letter.  Remark- 
able and  important  as  this  is,  however,  it  is  overshadowed  by  what  follows 
the  first  exposition  on  cryptanalysis  in  history. 

It  appeared  in  full  maturity  in  Qalqashandi’s  paraphrase  of  Ibn  ad- 
Duraihim,  but  its  beginnings  are  probably  to  be  found  in  the  intense  and 
minute  scrutiny  of  the  Koran  by  whole  schools  of  grammarians  in  Basra,  Kufa, 
and  Baghdad  to  elucidate  its  meanings.  Among  other  studies,  they  counted 
the  frequency  of  words  to  attempt  a chronology  for  the  chapters  of  the  Koran, 
certain  words  being  considered  as  having  been  used  only  in  the  later  chapters. 
They  examined  words  phonetically  to  see  whether  they  were  native  Arabic  or 
foreign  loanwords.  This  led  to  generalizations  about  the  composition  of 
Arabic  words.  For  example,  one  grammarian,  referring  to  the  lingual  letters 
ra\  lam,  and  nun,  and  the  labials  fa’,  ba’,  and  mim,  declared : “Now  when  the 
six  (labial  and  lingual)  letters  were  pronounced  and  emitted  by  the  tongue, 
they  proved  easy  to  form,  and  became  common  in  speech-patterns.  So  no 
true  quinquiliteral  roots  are  free  from  them,  or  at  least  from  one  ot  them. 
This  very  rule  reappeared  in  Ibn  ad-Duraihim’s  work.  Also  of  great  import- 
ance in  the  discovery  of  linguistic  phenomena  that  led  to  cryptanalysis  was  the 
development  of  lexicography.  In  making  a dictionary,  considerations  of  letter- 
frequency  and  of  which  letters  go  or  do  not  go  together  virtually  thrust  them- 
selves upon  the  lexicographer.  For  example,  the  Arabs  recognized  early  that 
za’  was  the  rarest  letter  in  Arabic  and,  contrariwise,  that  the  omnipresence  of 


The  First  3,000  Years  97 

the  definite  article  “al-”  made  alif  and  lam  the  most  common  letters  in 
normal  style. 

It  is  therefore  quite  understandable  that  the  Arab  world’s  first  great  philo- 
logist, the  first  man  to  conceive  the  idea  of  a comprehensive  dictionary,  a 
shining  light  of  the  Basra  school  of  grammarians,  wrote  a “Kitab  al-mu‘am- 
ma”  (“Book  of  Secret  Language”)  relatively  early  in  history.  This  was  Abu 
‘Abd  al-Rahman  al-Khalil  ibn  Ahmad  ibn  ‘Amr  ibn  Tammam  al  Farahidi 
al-Zadi  al  YahmadI,  who  lived  from  the  Arabic  year  100  to  between  170  and 
175  (or  a.d.  718/719  to  between  786  and  791).  Al-Khalil  was  inspired  to  write 
the  “Kitab  al-mu‘amma”— which  apparently  is  yet  another  Lost  Book— by 
his  solution  of  a cryptogram  in  Greek  sent  him  by  the  Byzantine  emperor. 
When  he  was  asked  how  he  managed  to  solve  it,  he  said,  “I  said  (to  myself), 
the  letter  must  begin  ‘In  the  name  of  God’  or  something  of  that  sort.  So  I 
worked  out  its  first  letters  on  that  basis,  and  it  came  right  for  me.” 

This  description,  and  the  fact  that  it  took  him  a month  before  he  could 
solve  it,  suggests  that  the  Arabs  had  not  yet  formulated  the  more  analytical 
techniques  of  cryptanalysis  based  upon  letter-frequency.  This  makes  sense 
1 50  years  or  so  after  the  Hegira  they  would  probably  still  be  in  the  early  stages 
of  their  linguistic  explorations.  But  by  the  time  of  Ibn  ad-Duraihim,  600  years 
later,  these  studies  would  have  ramified  enough  to  stimulate  some  unknown 
genius  to  apply  their  findings  to  the  solution  of  ciphers.  Indeed,  Ibn  ad- 
Duraihim’s  discussion  of  cryptanalysis,  as  reflected  in  Qalqashandi,  is  so 
mature  that  it  implies  a fairly  long  preceding  period  of  development.  The 
technique  was  at  least  moderately  well  known,  for  Ibn  Khaldun  wrote  in 
The  Muqaddimah : “Occasionally,  skillful  secretaries,  though  not  the  first  to 
invent  a code  [and  with  no  previous  knowledge  of  it],  nonetheless  find  rules 
[for  solving  it]  through  combinations  which  they  evolve  for  the  purpose 
with  the  help  of  their  intelligence,  and  which  they  call  ‘solving  the  puzzle 
[cryptanalysis].’  Well-known  writings  on  the  subject  are  in  the  possession  of 
the  people.  God  is  knowing  and  wise.” 

The  Ibn  ad-Duraihim-Qalqashandi  exposition  begins  at  the  beginning: 
the  cryptanalyst  must  know  the  language  in  which  the  cryptogram  is  written. 
Because  Arabic,  “the  noblest  and  most  exalted  of  all  languages,”  is  “the  one 
most  frequently  resorted  to”  (in  that  part  of  the  world),  there  follows  an 
extensive  discussion  of  its  linguistic  characteristics.  Lists  are  given  of  letters 
that  are  never  found  together  in  one  word,  of  letters  that  rarely  come  together 
in  a word,  of  combinations  of  letters  that  are  not  possible  (“Thus  tha’  may 
not  precede  shin.”),  and  so  on.  Finally,  the  exposition  gives  a list  of  letters  in 
order  of  “frequency  of  usage  in  Arabic  in  the  light  of  what  a perusal  of  the 
Noble  Koran  reveals.”  The  writers  even  note  that  “In  non-Koranic  writings, 
the  frequency  may  be  different  from  this."  With  these  basics  completed, 
Qalqashandi  goes  on: 

Ibn  ad-Duraihim  has  said:  When  you  want  to  solve  a message  which  you 

have  received  in  code,  begin  first  of  all  by  counting  the  letters,  and  then  count 


98 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


how  many  times  each  symbol  is  repeated  and  set  down  the  totals  individually.  If 
the  person  devising  the  code  has  been  very  thorough  and  has  concealed  the 
word-divisions  in  the  body  of  the  messages,  then  the  first  thing  to  be  worked  out 
is  the  symbol  which  divides  up  the  words.  To  do  this,  you  take  a letter  and  work 
on  the  assumption  that  the  next  letter  is  the  word-divider.  Then  you  go  all  through 
the  message  with  it,  having  regard  for  the  possible  combinations  of  letters  of 
which  the  words  may  be  composed,  as  has  been  previously  explained.  If  it  fits, 
[then  all  right] ; if  not,  you  take  the  next  letter  after  the  second  one.  If  that  fits, 
[then  all  right] ; if  not,  you  take  the  next  letter  after  that,  and  so  on,  until  you  are 
able  to  ascertain  the  division  of  the  words.  Next,  look  which  letters  occur  most 
frequently  in  the  message,  and  compare  this  with  the  pattern  of  letter-frequency 
previously  mentioned.  When  you  see  that  one  letter  occurs  in  the  message  more 
often  than  the  rest,  then  assume  that  it  is  alif;  then  assume  that  the  next  most 
frequent  is  lam.  The  accuracy  of  your  conjecture  should  be  confirmed  by  the  fact 
that  in  a majority  of  contexts,  lam  follows  alif.  . . . Then  the  first  words  which 
you  try  to  work  out  in  the  message  are  the  two-lettered  ones,  through  estimating 
the  most  feasible  combinations  of  their  letters,  until  you  are  sure  you  have  dis- 
covered something  correct  in  them;  then  look  at  their  symbols  and  write  down 
the  equivalents  by  them  [whenever  they  occur  in  the  message].  Apply  the  same 
principle  to  the  message’s  three-lettered  words  until  you  are  sure  you  have  got 
something,  then  write  out  the  equivalents  [all  through  the  message].  Apply  the 
same  principle  to  the  four-  and  five-lettered  words,  according  to  the  previous 
procedure.  Whenever  there  is  any  doubt,  posit  two  or  three  or  more  conjectures 
and  write  each  one  down  until  it  becomes  certain  from  another  word. 

Qalqashandi  follows  this  clear  explanation  with  a four-page  example  of 
solution  taken  from  Ibn  ad-Duraihim.  The  cryptogram  consists  of  two  lines 
of  verse  enciphered  with  symbols  of  apparently  arbitrary  invention.  At  the 
end,  he  notes  that  eight  letters  were  not  used  and  that  they  are  exactly  the 
same  eight  that  stand  at  the  foot  of  the  frequency  list.  “This,  however,  is  pure 
chance:  a letter  may  be  somewhat  misplaced  from  the  position  it  has  been 
assigned  in  the  above-mentioned  list,”  he  observes — an  observation  that 
argues  a fair  amount  of  experience  in  cryptanalysis.  To  nail  everything  down, 
Qalqashandi  gives  a second  example  from  Ibn  ad-Duraihim,  with  a rather 
longer  message.  With  this  three-page  illustration,  he  concludes  the  crypto- 
logic section  of  his  work. 

To  what  extent  the  Arabs  used  the  abilities  so  brilliantly  evident  here  in 
the  solution  of  military  or  diplomatic  cryptograms,  and  what  effects  they  had 
upon  Moslem  history,  is  not  known.  What  does  seem  certain  is  that,  like  the 
Arabic  civilization  itself,  this  knowledge  fell  into  desuetude  and  was  soon  lost. 
An  episode  of  250  years  later  dramatizes  the  decline. 

In  1600,  the  Sultan  of  Morocco,  Ahmad  al-Mansur,  sent  an  embassy 
headed  by  his  confidential  secretary,  ‘Abd  al-Wahid  ibn  Mas'ud  ibn  Muham- 
mad Anun,  to  Queen  Elizabeth  of  England  to  ally  himself  with  her  against 
Spain.  The  ambassador  reported  back  in  a monalphabetically  enciphered 
dispatch,  which  shortly  thereafter  apparently  somehow  fell  into  the  hands  of 


99 


The  First  3,000  Years 

an  Arab,  evidently  intelligent,  but  as  evidently  ignorant  of  his  great  crypto- 
logic heritage.  In  a memorandum,  he  wrote: 

Praise  be  to  Allah!  Writing  of  the  secretary  ‘Abd  al-Wahid  ibn  Mas  ‘ud  Anun. 
I found  a note  written  in  his  hand  in  which  he  had  noted  in  secret  characters  some 
information  destined  for  our  protector  Abu  1‘ Abbas  al-Mansur.  This  information 
relates  to  the  Sultana  of  the  Christians  (May  God  destroy  them!)  who  was  in  the 
country  of  London  in  the  year  1009.  From  the  moment  when  the  note  fell  into 
my  hands,  I never  stopped  studying  from  time  to  time  the  signs  which  it  bore. 

About  15  years  more  or  less  passed,  until  the  moment  when  God  (Glory  to 
Him !)  did  me  the  favor  of  permitting  me  to  comprehend  these  signs,  although  no 
one  taught  them  to  me.  . . . 

Fifteen  years!  For  what  Ibn  ad-Duraihim  would  have  solved  in  a few 
hours!  Yet  that  has  always  been  the  story  of  civilizations. 

Analyzing  the  frequency  and  contacts  of  letters  is  the  most  universal, 
most  basic  of  cryptanalytic  procedures.  A knowledge  of  it  is  requisite  to  an 
understanding  of  all  subsequent  techniques  of  substitution  cryptanalysis. 
Hence  it  seems  worthwhile  to  give  in  some  detail,  with  an  English  plaintext, 
an  example  of  such  a solution,  much  as  Qalqashandi  did  in  Arabic. 

Cryptanalysis  rests  upon  the  fact  that  the  letters  of  language  have  “per- 
sonalities” of  their  own.  To  the  casual  observer,  they  may  look  as  alike  as 
troops  lined  up  for  inspection,  but  just  as  the  sergeant  knows  his  men  as  “the 
goldbrick,”  “the  kid,”  “the  reliable  soldier,”  so  the  cryptanalyst  knows 
the  letters  of  the  alphabet.  Though  in  a cryptogram  they  wear  disguises,  the 
cryptanalyst  observes  their  actions  and  idiosyncrasies,  and  infers  their  identity 
from  these  traits.  In  ordinary  monalphabetic  substitution,  his  task  is  fairly 
simple  because  each  letter’s  camouflage  differs  from  every  other  letter’s  and 
the  camouflage  remains  the  same  throughout  the  cryptogram. 

How  would  he  go  about  doing  this  for  the  following  cryptogram?

The  cryptanalyst  would  begin  by  counting  each  letter’s  frequency  (how 
often  it  occurs  in  a text)  and  its  contacts  (which  letters  it  touches,  and  how 
many  different  ones).  The  frequency  count  of  this  cryptogram  is  this:

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


A widely  used  frequency  table  of  200  letters  of  normal  English  is  this: 

16  3 6 8 21  4 3 12  13  I 176 

ABCDEFG  HI  JKLM 

percentage:  8 1.5  3 4 13  2 1.5  6 6.5  .5  .5  3.5  3 

14  16  4 Vi  13  12  18  6 2 3 14  Vi 

NOPQ  RSTUVWXYZ 

percentage:  7 8 2 .25  6.5  6 9 3 1 1.5  .5  2 .25 

But  it  is  not  possible  to  simply  list  the  letters  in  the  cryptogram  in  the  order  of 
frequency,  and  then,  lining  that  list  up  with  one  giving  the  letters  of  normal 
text  in  their  order  of  frequency,  mechanically  replace  the  cipher  with  the 
“plain.”  In  this  case,  the  two  lists  are: 

letters  in  order  of  frequency 

in  normal  text  etaonirshdl  ucmpf  ywgbvjkqxz 
in  cryptogram  nhogtuafcyj  xz  ewi  qbkvlmp 

Brute  substitution  of  letters  of  the  upper  row  for  those  of  the  lower  at  the 
beginning  of  the  cryptogram  would  give  this  “plaintext” : oluueooanceihanpjatd 
. . . Obviously,  the  two  frequency  counts  do  not  match.  Which  is  not 
surprising,  since  they  are  based  on  different  texts,  using  different  words  with 
different  letters  in  them.  But  whereas  the  relative  frequencies  may  shift  slightly, 
making,  say,  i more  frequent  than  a in  a particular  case,  the  letters  generally 
do  not  stray  very  far  from  their  home  areas  in  the  frequency  table.  Thus, 
e,  t,  a,  o,  n,  i,  r,  s,  and  h will  normally  be  found  in  the  high-frequency  group; 
d,  I,  u,  c,  and  m in  the  medium-frequency  group;  p,f  y,  w,  g,  b,  and  v in  the 
lows,  and  j,  k,  q,  x,  and  z in  the  rare  group.  Furthermore,  a sharp  break  in 
frequency  usually  sets  off  the  highs  from  the  mediums;  the  lowest  of  the  highs, 
h,  is  normally  6 per  cent,  while  the  highest  of  the  mediums,  d,  is  only  4 per 
cent.  This  step-down  is  quite  visible  in  the  cryptogram’s  frequency  count: 

NHOGTUA  F CYJXZ  EWI  QBKV  LMP 

36  26  25  23  23  20  17  17  13  13  12  9 8 7 6 5 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 

It  is  the  drop  between  F and  c.  Though  one  of  the  usual  nine  highs  has  slipped 
out  of  its  category,  the  remaining  eight  letters  above  the  division  are  almost 
certainly  all  high-frequency  letters,  n probably  represents  e,  which  is  out- 
standingly the  most  common  letter  (about  one  in  every  eight  of  normal  text). 
Frequency  alone  cannot  tell  much  more  than  this. 

But  contact  can.  Every  letter  has  a cluster  of  preferred  associations  that 
constitute  its  most  distinguishing  characteristic.  The  cryptanalyst  can  spot 
these  almost  by  eye  if  he  sets  up  a contact  chart  for  the  high-frequency  cipher 
letters  like  the  one  on  the  following  page.  In  the  chart,  the  letter  being  counted 
stands  at  the  left,  with  the  other  letters  strung  out  in  order  of  frequency  in  a 
line  to  the  right.  Each  tally  above  a letter  in  the  line  means  that  the  letter  in 
that  line  has  preceded  the  subject  letter  in  one  instance,  while  each  tally  below 
means  that  it  has  followed  the  subject  letter.

The  chart  shows  that  h has  preceded  n three  times — in  other  words,  that  the 
digraph  hn  has  occurred  three  times — and  has  followed  it,  to  make  nh,  just 
once. 

In  a chart  like  this,  plaintext  e is  about  as  hard  to  recognize  under  its 
cipher  masquerade  as  a six-and-a-half-foot-tall  man  at  a costume  party. 
It  is  president  of  this  republic  of  letters  because  it  leads  all  the  rest  in 
frequency,  yet  it  is  democratic  enough  to  contact  more  different  letters  more 
often  than  any  other  letter,  including  a goodly  number  in  the  low-frequency 
bracket.  Indubitably,  n here  is  President  e. 

Next  most  distinctive  are  the  three  high-frequency  vowels,  a,  i,  and  o.  Like 
rival  dowagers  at  a society  ball,  they  avoid  one  another  as  much  as  possible. 
A glance  at  the  contact  chart  shows  that  ciphertext  o,  u,  and  a are  the  most 
mutually  exclusive,  (h,  which  rarely  associates  with  u and  a,  is  ruled  out  as  a 
vowel  possibility  because  it  contacts  o so  often.)  Thus,  these  three  letters 
probably  represent  the  three  high-frequency  plaintext  vowels.  Which  is  which 
can  often  be  ascertained  by  the  fact  that  the  plaintext  digraph  io  is  fairly 
frequent  while  the  other  five  combinations  (or,  ia,  ai,  oa,  ao)  are  fairly  rare. 
The  contact  chart  shows  these  frequencies:  oa,  2;  ou,  1 ; and  uo,  ua,  ao,  and 
au,  all  zero.  If  oa  = io,  then  u would  be  a,  and  ou  would  be  ia,  which  happens 
to  be  the  most  common  of  the  other  five  digraphs.  Better  still,  nu,  which 
appears  five  times,  would  stand  for  ea,  the  most  frequent  of  all  the  digraphs 
involving  vowels,  while  UN,  which  does  not  exist  in  this  message,  would 
stand  for  ae,  the  rarest.  This  is  a nice  corroboration  for  the  vowel  identifica- 
tion. Even  if  identification  of  the  individual  vowels  is  not  possible,  it  is  nearly 
always  wise  to  begin  the  analysis  by  determining  which  letters  are  the  four 
high-frequency  vowels. 

What  about  consonants?  The  easiest  to  spot  is  plaintext  n because  four 
fifths  of  the  letters  that  precede  it  are  vowels.  The  contact  chart  shows  that 


102  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

ciphertext  t is  preceded  by  ciphertext  n,  o,  u,  and  a 17  times  out  of  23.  It  is  a 
good  bet  for  n. 

The  behavior  of  y in  the  chart  is  striking.  It  runs  before  n (=  e)  like  a 
herald  and  never  follows  it,  while  on  the  other  hand  it  invariably  tags  along 
behind  h and  never  precedes  it.  It  behaves,  in  fact,  just  like  plaintext  h.  The 
digraph  he  is  one  of  the  most  common  in  English,  while  eh  is  very  rare;  th 
is  the  most  common  of  all,  and  lit  is  also  fairly  rare.  If  y = /;,  then  ciphertext 
h must  be  t — an  assumption  that  fits  in  well  with  its  frequency.  In  telegraphic 
texts  where  the  is  deleted,  plaintext  h can  usually  be  spotted  because — just 
the  opposite  of  n — it  precedes  vowels  about  ten  times  as  often  as  it  follows 
them. 

The  only  two  high-frequency  letters  remaining  to  be  identified  are  r and  s. 
The  basic  difference  between  them  is  that  r,  rather  like  a social  climber, 
associates  much  more  with  the  vowels — dowagers  a,  i,  and  o as  well  as 
President  e — than  does  s,  while  s,  a proletarian  at  heart,  mingles  with  the 
consonants,  the  blue-collar  laborers  of  the  alphabet.  These  differences  in  their 
contacts  hold  both  absolutely  and  relatively.  In  the  chart,  however,  inspection 
of  the  contact  bars  for  G and  F,  the  only  two  high-frequency  letters  left,  yields 
contradictory  evidence:  F contacts  the  identified  vowels  more  often  than  G — 
21  times  to  g’s  17 — but  it  also  contacts  the  three  high-frequency  consonants 
( t , /;,  h)  more — 4 times  to  g’s  3 — even  though  its  frequency  is  lower. 

It  is  not  necessary  to  force  the  decision,  for  even  without  these  identifica- 
tions, 160  out  of  the  280  letters  in  the  message  have  been  given  tentative 
plaintext  equivalents.  The  acid  test  as  to  whether  they  are  right,  of  course, 
consists  in  substituting  them  into  the  cryptogram  and  seeing  whether  they 
make  sense.  In  doing  so,  many  cryptanalysts  use  pencils  of  different  colors 
for  the  plain-  and  the  ciphertext  to  make  them  easier  to  distinguish.  They  also 
leave  a lot  of  space  between  the  lines  of  the  ciphertext  to  allow  for  multiple

Just  this  portion  of  the  message  will  suffice  for  its  solution.  The  cryptanalyst 
uses  these  tentative  identifications  to  root  out  the  meanings  of  other  cipher 
letters.  He  does  this  by  guessing  at  what  the  missing  letters  should  be  to  make 


103 


The  First  3,000  Years 

up  intelligible  text.  For  example,  near  the  beginning  the  plaintext  sequence 
-ith-  appears.  This  could  be  a portion  of  the  word  with. 

No  cryptanalyst,  if  asked,  could  at  this  point  give  any  proof  that  his 
assumption  is  correct.  All  it  is  now  is  a kind  of  guess,  guided  only  by  the 
porous  laws  of  probability.  Successive  guesses  will  either  increasingly  confirm 
it  or  contradict  it,  causing  the  cryptanalyst  to  discard  it.  But  each  successive 
assumption  is  put  forth  at  first  upon  the  same  slim  basis  as  this.  Eventually, 
the  internal  consistency  of  the  final  result  piles  up  such  an  immense  weight  of 
probability  that  the  validity  of  the  solution  becomes  a virtual  certainty.  But 
the  cryptanalyst  who  seeks  proof  absolute  for  each  assumption  as  he  makes  it 
will  never  find  it— and  he  will  never  solve  the  cipher. 

Here,  however,  with  seems  likely.  This  assumption  means  that  m — w,  and 
this  equivalence  can  be  filled  in  wherever  m appears  in  the  cryptogram,  to  see 
whether  it  suggests  any  more  new  words.  Just  ten  letters  down  the  line,  it 
forms  the  sequence  with-n-nown-i- . . . , which  suggests  the  phrase  with 
unknown.  The  long  plaintext  sequence  -int-ition-  provides  a check:  the  J = u 
identity  fits  right  in  to  form  the  word  intuition.  The  new  plaintext  letters  are 
inserted  and  used  to  provide  clues  to  still  more  letters.  This  process  of  recon- 
structing the  plaintext— perhaps  the  easiest  and  the  most  fun  in  cryptanalysis 
—is  called  “anagramming.”* 

It  can  be  greatly  speeded  by  a parallel  reconstruction : that  of  the  key 
alphabet.  If  the  ciphertext  letters  are  written  under  a normal  alphabet  that 
serves  as  the  plaintext  alphabet,  their  mere  arrangement  will  often  donate 
additional  equivalences.  The  ciphertext  listings  thus  far  recovered  are  these: 

plaintext  abcdefghij  klmnopqrstuvwxyz 
ciphertext  u n yok  ta  hjm 

Because  it  is  difficult  to  remember  an  incoherent  string  of  26  letters  that 
constitutes  the  set  of  cipher  equivalents,  cipher  alphabets  are  often  based  on  a 
single  word  that  is  easy  to  memorize.  Various  derivations  are  possible,  but  the 
simplest  is  just  to  write  out  the  keyword,  omitting  repeated  letters,  then  to 
follow  it  with  the  remaining  letters  of  the  alphabet.  Thus  the  cipher  alphabet 
springing  from  the  keyword  chimpanzee  would  be: 

plaintext  abcdefghij  klmnopqrstuvwxyz 
ciphertext  chimpanzebdfg  jkloqrstuvwxy 

The  portion  of  the  ciphertext  alphabet  following  the  keyword  contains  long 
alphabetical  sequences.  Often  the  cryptanalyst  can  complete  segments  that 
have  been  partially  filled  in,  and  thus  recover  more  equivalencies.  For 
example,  if  he  sees  qr-tu,  he  needs  no  great  wit  to  realize  that  the  missing 
letter  must  be  S. 

One  such  segment  leaps  to  the  eye  in  the  partial  alphabet  recovered  rom 

* This  usage  of  the  term  seldom  conflicts  with  its  traditional  sense  of  rearranging  letters 
of  one  text  to  spell  another,  like  night  to  thing.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

the  cryptogram:  hj-m.  Only  k or  l can  fit  there,  but  since  ciphertext  k has 
already  been  assigned  to  plaintext  k (from  unknown),  l must  slide  in  to  re- 
present v,  thereby  giving  the  cryptanalyst  a free  identification.  The  technique 
can  help  in  another  way:  to  decide  between  f and  G for  r and  j.  If  f = j and 
G = r,  the  sequence  in  the  key  alphabet  under  r and  s would  run  backwards: 

...rs... 

...GF... 

This  is  unlikely,  so  f = r and  a = s.  The  cipher  alphabet  also  gives  ideas  for 
plaintext  equivalencies.  For  example,  u = a in  the  alphabet,  so  if  the  crypt- 
analyst sees  a v in  the  cryptogram,  he  may  try  b as  one  possibility  for  its  plain- 
text to  complete  the  uv  segment  under  ab.  In  this  case,  it  happens  to  work  out 
right.  With  these  new  values  inserted  in  the  top  two  lines,  the  solution  is 
virtually  finished:

The  two  x’s  must  be  two  c’s  to  make  success;  then  b must  be p to  form  ciphers ; 
e must  be/,  for  four;  w,  g for  things  and  -ing;  and  so  forth.  At  this  point, 
hypotheses  pour  in  literally  faster  than  they  can  be  written  down.  The  plain- 
text (with  punctuation  supplied)  reads:  “ Success  in  dealing  with  unknown 
ciphers  is  measured  by  these  four  things  in  the  order  named:  perseverance, 
careful  methods  of  analysis,  intuition,  luck.  The  ability  at  least  to  read  the 
language  of  the  original  text  is  very  desirable  but  not  essential Such  is  the 
opening  sentence  of  Parker  Hitt's  Manual  for  the  Solution  of  Military  Ciphers. 

The  full  key  alphabet,  including  equivalents  for  plaintext  j,  q,  and  z,  which 
did  not  appear,  is  based  on  the  keyphrase  NEW  YORK.  CITY:

ciphertext  uvxznewyorkc  i tabdfghj  lmpqs 

The  careful  examination  of  the  propensities  of  the  various  plaintext  letters 
may  seem  unnecessary.  In  the  case  of  monalphabetic  substitutions  with 
word  divisions,  solution  may  often  be  obtained  by  taking  a stab  at  common 
words  (the,  and),  guessing  at  pattern  words  whose  repeated  letters  form  a 
distinctive  configuration  (wxyzy  might  be  there),  or  comparing  short  words 
(hx,  xh,  hl,  pl,  and  px  might  be  on,  no,  of  if,  and  in).  But  a knowledge  of  the 
characteristics  of  plaintext  lies  at  the  heart  of  the  solution  of  more  complex 
ciphers,  where  that  plaintext  is  concealed  more  effectively.  Naturally,  in 
shorter  cryptograms,  solutions  do  not  run  quite  as  smoothly  as  the  longer 
ones  that  allow  the  statistics  of  language  enough  play  to  become  reliable.  For 
these  more  difficult  problems,  expert  solvers  offer  novices  two  tips:  (1)  make 
contact  charts:  the  drudgery  usually  pays  off  in  faster  and  more  accurate 
identifications;  (2)  when  stumped,  and  no  likely  plaintext  values  are  visible,

The  First  3,000  Years 

try  something  and  see  where  it  leads;  even  if  it  proves  wrong,  it  has  narrowed 
down  the  possibilities.  No  cryptogram  was  ever  solved  by  staring  at  it.  Finally, 
it  should  be  noted  that  monalphabetic  substitutions  that  use  numbers  or 
symbols  as  their  ciphertext  equivalents  are  solvable  in  the  same  way  as  those 
using  letters.  The  difference  in  the  camouflage  does  not  alter  the  features  of 
the  underlying  language.

THE  RISE  OF  THE  WEST 


western  civilization  began  the  use  of  political  cryptology  that  it  has 
continued  uninterrupted  to  the  present  as  it  emerged  from  the  feudalism  of 
the  Middle  Ages.  The  secret  writing  of  that  time  was  as  embryonic  as  other 
elements  of  what  was  to  become  the  world’s  dominant  civilization.  Its  use  was 
at  first  infrequent  and  irregular;  the  systems  were  rudimentary,  even  in  the 
church,  still  the  greatest  and  most  wide-ranging  power  of  its  day.  But  there 
were  no  longer  any  regressions,  no  thousand-year  hiatuses.  Cryptology  only 
progressed.  And  from  the  earliest  days  there  existed  the  two  basic  modern 
forms:  codes  and  ciphers. 

The  substitutions  of  code  stemmed  in  part  from  abbreviations,  in  part 
from  obscure  epithets  and  imagery  used  in  oracles  and  magic  half  to  reveal, 
half  to  conceal  meanings.  The  oldest  cryptographic  document  in  the  Vatican 
archives  includes  substitutions  of  both  origins.  This  is  a little  list  of  name- 
equivalents  compiled  in  1326  or  1327  for  use  in  the  struggle  between  the  pro- 
pope Guelphs  and  the  pro-Holy  Roman  Emperor  Ghibellines  in  central  Italy. 
It  replaced  the  title  official — evidently  representing  anyone  of  authority — by 
the  single  letter  o.  The  Ghibellines  became  Egyptians  and  the  Guelphs  the 
children  of  Israel.  A decade  later,  another  list  moved  away  from  the  jargon 
and  introduced  some  secrecy  to  its  abbreviations  when  it  gave  lord  a as  the 
equivalent  for  our  lord.  Finally,  on  an  undated  slip  of  paper,  perhaps  a little 
later  than  the  second  list,  appears  the  first  modern  code.  It  is  very  small  but  it 
manifests  undiluted  the  essential  attribute:  the  paramountcy  of  secrecy  in  its 
substitutions  (though  they  secondarily  enjoy  the  advantages  of  abbreviation): 
A = king,  D = the  Pope,  s = Marescallus,  and  so  on. 

Ciphers,  of  course,  had  been  used  by  monks  all  through  the  Middle  Ages 
for  scribal  amusement,  and  the  Renaissance  knew  from  its  study  of  such 
classic  texts  as  Suetonius  that  the  ancient  world  had  used  ciphers  for  political 
purposes.  Hence  the  basic  concept  was  already  known.  As  early  as  1226,  a 
faint  political  cryptography  appeared  in  the  archives  of  Venice,  where  dots  or 
crosses  replaced  the  vowels  in  a few  scattered  words.  A century  and  a half 
later,  in  1363,  the  Archbishop  of  Naples,  Pietro  di  Grazie,  enciphered  vowels 
fairly  regularly  in  his  correspondence  with  the  papal  curia  and  with  cardinals. 
In  1379,  the  antipope  Clement  VII,  who  had  fled  to  Avignon  the  previous  year

The  Rise  of  the  West 

to  begin  the  Great  Schism  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  in  which  two 
popes  claimed  to  reign,  saw  the  need  of  new  ciphers  for  his  new  establishment. 
One  of  his  secretaries,  Gabrieli  di  Lavinde,  a man  from  Parma  who  had 
perhaps  worked  in  one  of  the  chancelleries  of  the  northern  Italian  city-states, 
compiled  a set  of  individual  keys  for  24  correspondents  of  Clement,  among 
them  Niccolo  of  Naples,  the  Duke  of  Montevirdi,  and  the  Bishop  of  Venice. 

Lavinde's  collection  of  keys— the  oldest  extant  in  modern  Western  civiliza- 
tion— includes  several  that  combine  elements  of  both  code  and  cipher.  In 
addition  to  a mon alphabetic  substitution  alphabet,  often  with  nulls,  nearly 
every  key  comprised  a small  repertory  of  a dozen  or  more  common  words  or 
names  with  two-letter  code  equivalents.  They  constitute  the  earliest  examples 
of  a cryptographic  system  that  was  to  hold  sway  over  all  Europe  and  America 
for  the  next  450  years:  the  nomenclator.  The  nomenclator  united  the  cipher 
substitution  alphabet  of  letters  and  the  code  list  of  word,  syllable,  and  name 
equivalents;  it  is  a cross  between  the  two  basic  systems.  Code  and  cipher  were

separated  in  the  early  nomenclators  but  were  merged  in  the  later.  The 
nomenclator  eventually  expanded  its  word-substitution  lis  ’ from  the  few 
dozen  names  of  Lavinde  to  the  2,000  or  3,000  syllables  and  words  of  those  of 
Czarist  Russia  in  the  1700s. 

The  first  substitution  alphabets  provided  only  a single  substitute  for  each 
plaintext  letter.  Later  ones  supplied  multiple  substitutes.  The  first  known 
Western  instance  of  multiple  cipher-representations  occurs  in  a cipher  that 
the  Duchy  of  Mantua  prepared  in  1401  for  correspondence  with  one  Simeone 
de  Crema.  Each  of  the  plaintext  vowels  has  several  possible  equivalents.  This 
testifies  silently  that,  by  this  time,  the  West  knew  cryptanalysis.  There  can  be 
no  other  explanation  for  the  appearance  of  these  multiple  substitutes,  or 
homophones.  The  cipher  secretary  of  Mantua  introduced  them  to  hinder 
anyone  who  might  try  to  solve  an  intercepted  dispatch,  for  each  extra  ciphei 
symbol  means  that  much  more  work,  that  much  more  that  has  to  be  dug  out 
by  the  cryptanalyst.  That  the  homophones  were  applied  to  vowels,  and 
not  just  indiscriminately,  indicates  a knowledge  of  at  least  the  outlines  ol 
frequency  analysis.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Where  did  that  knowledge  come  from?  It  probably  developed  indigen- 
ously. Though  it  is  true  that  contact  with  the  Moslem  and  other  civilizations 
during  the  Crusades  triggered  the  cultural  explosion  of  the  Renaissance,  and 
that  Arabic  works  of  science,  mathematics,  and  philosophy  poured  into 
Europe  from  Moorish  centers  of  scholarship  in  Spain,  it  seems  unlikely  that 
cryptanalysis  emigrated  from  there.  It  was  considered  more  a branch  of 
grammar  than  of  science  or  mathematics;  it  was  linked  too  closely  in 
Arabic  tradition  to  the  language  of  the  Koran;  its  importance  was  much  less 
than  that  of  medicine  or  algebra  or  alchemy;  in  any  case,  neither  Ibn  ad- 
Duraihim’s  nor  Qalqashandi’s  works,  the  only  ones  known  to  give  a full 
explanation  of  the  technique,  were  translated.  It  is  possible  but  improbable 
that  a diplomat  to  one  of  the  Arabic  lands  may  have  brought  back  a know- 
ledge of  cryptanalysis.  But  cultural  diffusion  such  as  this  would  probably 
leave  some  written  records,  and  none  exist  for  any  transfer  of  cryptanalysis 
from  Islam  to  Christendom.  It  is  dangerous  to  infer  something  from  nothing, 
but  given  two  possibilities,  the  nothing  may  imply  one  possibility  more  than 
the  other:  and  it  would  rather  be  expected  that  no  written  records  would  be 
created  if  cryptanalysis  developed  spontaneously.  The  bright  chancellery 
official  who  succeeded  in  puzzling  out  the  meaning  of  the  enciphered  words  in 
a captured  dispatch  would  be  hardly  likely  to  give  away,  either  orally  or  in 
writing,  the  knowledge  that  could  bring  him  extra  money  and  prestige. 

Though  no  known  documents  attest  to  such  a genesis  for  Western  political 
cryptanalysis— and  none  object  to  it,  either— it  seems  the  most  probable.  The 
official  would  have  probably  effected  his  solutions  at  first  by  guessing  at 
words,  much  as  did  the  four  Irishmen  who  solved  Dubthach’s  cryptogram. 
As  through  repeated  cryptanalyses  he  became  more  acquainted  with  the 
personalities  of  the  letters,  he  might  have  eventually  stumbled  on  the  principle 
of  frequency  analysis.  The  same  development  may  have  taken  place  separately 
in  several  principalities,  and  it  is  not  inconceivable  that  one  new  solver  may 
have  reasoned  his  way  to  frequency  analysis  by  wondering  why  a crypto- 
grapher in  another  city  used  homophones  for  vowels! 

What  is  certain  is  that,  as  the  secular  principalities  of  Italy  began  to  use 
cipher  regularly  in  the  1390s  and  early  1400s,  their  cipher  alphabets  gradually 
began  to  include  homophones  for  vowels.  So  slow  was  cryptology’s  develop- 
ment, however,  that  not  until  the  mid- 1500s  did  consonants  begin  to  get 
homophones.  Likewise,  the  code  lists  of  the  nomenclators  did  not  expand 
much  until  well  into  the  1500s. 

The  growth  of  cryptology  resulted  directly  from  the  flowering  of  modern 
diplomacy.  In  this,  for  the  first  time,  states  maintained  permanent  relations 
with  one  another.  The  resident  ambassadors  sent  home  regular  reports — they 
have  been  called  “honorable  spies” — and  the  jealousy,  suspicion,  and  in- 
trigues among  the  Italian  city-states  made  it  often  necessary  to  encipher  these. 
As  the  practice  implies,  the  reports  were  sometimes  opened  and  read,  and,  if 
necessary,  cryptanalyzed.  By  the  end  of  the  century,  cryptology  had  become 


109 


The  Rise  of  the  West 

important  enough  for  most  states  to  keep  full-time  cipher  secretaries  occupied 
in  making  up  new  keys,  enciphering  and  deciphering  messages,  and  solving 
intercepted  dispatches.  Sometimes  the  cryptanalysts  were  separate  from  the 
cipher  secretaries  and  were  called  in  only  when  needed. 

Perhaps  the  most  elaborate  organization  was  Venice’s.  It  fell  under  the 
immediate  control  of  the  Council  of  Ten,  the  powerful  and  mysterious  body 
that  ruled  the  republic  largely  through  its  efficient  secret  police.  Venice  owed 
her  preeminence  largely  to  Giovanni  Soro,  who  was  perhaps  the  West  s first 
great  cryptanalyst.  Soro,  appointed  cipher  secretary  in  1506,  enjoyed  remark- 
able success  in  solving  the  ciphers  of  numerous  principalities.  His  solution  of 
a dispatch  of  Mark  Anthony  Colonna,  chief  of  the  army  of  the  Holy  Roman 
Emperor  Maximilian  I,  requesting  20,000  ducats  or  the  presence  of  the 
emperor  with  the  army,  gave  an  insight  into  Colonna’s  problems.  So  great 
was  Soro’s  fame  that  other  courts  sharpened  their  ciphers,  and  as  early  as 
1510  the  papal  curia  was  sending  him  ciphers  that  no  one  in  Rome  could 
solve.  In  1526,  Pope  Clement  VII  (not  to  be  confused  with  the  antipope  of  the 
same  name)  twice  sent  him  intercepts  for  solution,  and  Soro  twice  succeeded 
— once  with  three  long  dispatches  from  Maximilian  I’s  successor,  the  Holy 
Roman  Emperor  Charles  V of  Spain,  to  his  emissary  at  Rome,  and  once  with 
letters  addressed  by  the  Duke  of  Ferrara  to  his  ambassador  in  Spain.  When 
one  of  Clement’s  messages  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  Florentines,  Clement, 
exclaiming  “Soro  can  decipher  any  cipher!”  sent  him  a copy  of  the  message 
to  see  whether  it  was  secure.  He  was  reassured  when  Soro  reported  that  he 
could  not  solve  it— but  one  wonders  whether  Soro  was  not  simply  lulling  the 
pope  into  a false  security. 

On  May  15,  1542,  Soro,  who  was  two  years  from  the  grave,  was  given  two 
assistants,  and  from  then  on  Venice  had  three  cipher  secretaries.  Their  office 
was  in  the  Doge’s  Palace  above  the  Sala  di  Segret,  and  here  they  worked 
behind  barred  doors.  When  cipher  dispatches  of  foreign  powers  fell  into  the 
hands  of  the  Venetians,  their  translation  was  ordered  at  once.  No  one  was 
allowed  to  disturb  the  cryptanalysts  and,  reportedly,  they  were  not  permitted 
to  leave  their  office  until  the  solution  was  obtained.  It  then  had  to  be  delivered 
without  delay  to  the  signory.  The  cryptologists  usual  salary  was  ten  (later 
twelve)  ducats  a month,  paid  semiannually.  The  art  was  taught  in  a kind  of 
school,  which  even  held  examinations  each  September.  The  cryptologists  also 
wrote  treatises  explaining  their  techniques.  That  by  Soro,  written  in  the  early 
1500s  on  the  solution  of  Latin,  Italian,  Spanish,  and  French  ciphers,  is 
another  Lost  Book  of  cryptology,  for  though  he  turned  it  over  to  the  Council 
of  Ten  on  March  29,  1539,  no  trace  of  it  can  be  found  in  the  archives.  Frag- 
mentary notes  written  by  his  successor,  Giovanni  Battista  de  Ludovicis, 
survive,  and  so  do  careful  thorough  surveys  of  the  field  by  other  cipher 
secretaries,  Girolamo  Franceschi,  Giovanni  Francesco  Marin,  and  Agostino 
Amadi,  whose  manual  is  especially  fine  and  whose  work  was  so  outstanding 
that  Venice  rewarded  him  by  giving  his  two  sons  pensions  of  ten  ducats  a

month  for  life.  The  Council  of  Ten  held  contests  in  ciphers,  and  advances  in 
the  art  were  rewarded:  a Marco  Rafael,  later  a favorite  of  Henry  VIII  of 
England,  received  100  ducats  in  1525  for  a new  method  of  invisible  writing. 
If  the  cipher  secretaries  made  valuable  suggestions,  they  would  get  a raise. 
On  the  other  hand,  if  they  betrayed  any  of  the  state  cryptologic  secrets,  they 
could  be  put  to  death. 

The  council  was  as  alert  to  protect  its  own  ciphers  as  it  was  to  solve  those 
of  its  rivals.  It  kept  a number  of  nomenclators  ready  to  replace  compromised 
ones,  and  it  did  not  hesitate  to  use  them.  For  example,  new  ciphers  were  sent 
on  August  31,  1547,  to  the  Venetian  envoys  to  Rome,  England,  France, 
Turkey,  Milan,  and  the  Holy  Roman  Emperor.  On  June  5,  1595,  a 
returning  ambassador  reported  that  Venetian  ciphers  had  been  solved  and  on 
June  12,  the  council  ordered  a wholesale  replacement  of  the  ambassadorial 
nomenclators  with  new  ones  prepared  by  Pietro  Partenio,  then  the  most 
expert  of  the  cipher  secretaries.  Earlier,  Soro  had  instituted  a “general  cipher” 
(a  nomenclator)  to  permit  the  ambassadors  to  communicate  among  them- 
selves; this  was  in  addition  to  the  “special  cipher”  each  ambassador  held  for 
messages  to  and  from  home. 

But  Venice  was  not  the  only  locale  of  expert  cryptanalysts  during  the 
Renaissance.  In  Florence,  Pirrho  Musehli,  Conte  della  Sasseta,  solved  liter- 
ally scores  of  messages  during  the  decade  from  1546  to  1557,  reconstructing, 
among  others,  nomenclators  used  between  Henry  II  of  France  and  his  envoy 
in  Denmark,  another  between  the  same  king  and  his  emissary  at  Siena,  a 
cipher  of  Cardinal  di  Mendoze  of  Naples.  His  expertise  was  so  renowned 
that  others  came  to  him,  as  they  had  to  Soro,  to  solve  ciphers  for  them.  A 
papal  cryptologist,  discussing  contemporaries,  said  that  to  Musehli  “is  due 
first  place  and  all  honor.”  Among  his  clients  were  the  Duke  of  Alba  and  the 
King  of  England,  who  sent  him  a cryptogram  that  had  been  found  in  a sole 
of  a pair  of  golden  shoes  from  France.  Musefili’s  successor,  Camillo  Giusti, 
was  reputed  to  be  even  more  expert.  They  extended  a fine  tradition,  since  the 
ciphers  devised  by  their  predecessors  for  the  ruling  Medici  family,  particularly 
those  of  Lorenzo  the  Magnificent,  display  a lively  appreciation  of  the  methods 
of  cryptanalysis.  Further  attesting  to  cryptology’s  importance  is  its  mention 
in  a book,  The  Art  of  War,  by  another  well-known  Florentine — Niccold 
Machiavelli. 

The  cruel,  sinister,  and  resolute  dukes  of  Sforza,  oligarchs  of  Milan,  were 
also  well  served  in  their  cryptology.  One  of  their  secretaries,  Cicco  Simonetta, 
wrote  the  world’s  first  tract  devoted  entirely  to  cryptanalysis.  In  Pavia  on 
July  4,  1474,  he  set  down  thirteen  rules  for  solving  monalphabetic  substitu- 
tion ciphers  in  which  word  divisions  are  preserved.  The  manuscript,  on  two 
narrow  strips  of  paper,  begins:  “The  first  requisite  is  to  see  whether  the  docu- 
ment is  in  Latin  or  in  the  vernacular,  and  this  can  be  determined  in  the  follow- 
ing manner:  See  whether  the  words  of  the  document  in  question  have  only 
five  different  terminations,  or  less,  or  more;  if  there  are  only  five  or  less,  you 


111 


The  Rise  of  the  West 

are  justified  in  concluding  that  it  is  in  the  vernacular.  . . Nine  years  later, 
Milanese  cryptology  was  boasting  the  clever  trick  of  using  two  symbols  to 
mark  as  nulls  all  the  ciphertext  signs  between  them.  The  greatest  compliment 
to  Milan  came  in  a backhanded  fashion  from  the  cryptologists  of  Modena, 
who  early  in  the  15th  century  provided  a more  elaborate  nomenclator  for 
their  envoy  to  Milan  than  for  any  other. 

Courts  outside  Italy  had  cryptanalysts  as  well.  In  France,  Philibert 
Babou,  sieur  de  la  Bourdaisiere,  who  held  the  post  of  first  secretary  of  state, 
solved  intercepted  dispatches  for  Francis  I.  One  observer  saw  Babou  “oft- 
times  decipher,  without  the  alphabet,  it  must  be  understood,  many  intercepted

of  the  formation  and  structure  of  the  words  of  a language.  Solutions  of  this  kind  are  not  at 
all  uncommon.  Obviously,  the  more  the  cryptanalyst  knows  about  a language,  the  more 
easily  he  can  solve  cryptograms  in  it.  If  he  has  never  seen  a sentence  in  the  language,  then 
the  solution  is  virtually  impossible — “virtually”  because  the  alternations  of  vowels  and  con- 
sonants common  to  all  languages  may  yet  afford  some  clues.

favors  from  the  king,  but  one  wonders  whether  they  were  for  cryptology  or 
cuckoldry. 

England  opened  the  letters  of  the  Venetian  ambassador  to  the  court  of 
Henry  VIII — presumably  those  of  other  ambassadors  as  well — and  un- 
doubtedly solved  or  tried  to  solve  their  ciphers.  The  Venetian  ambassador, 
however,  well  schooled  by  the  excellent  cryptologists  of  his  city,  paraphrased 
the  enciphered  sections  of  his  instructions  before  communicating  them  to  the 
English  to  prevent  their  serving  as  a massive  crib  to  the  key. 

Among  the  more  expert  of  the  cryptologic  experts  of  the  Renaissance  were 
those  who  labored  in  the  service  of  His  Holiness,  the  Supreme  Pontiff,  who 
in  those  days  wielded  as  much  temporal  as  spiritual  power.  The  popes  had 
long  had  their  own  cryptographers,  and  finally  Paul  III,  who  succeeded 
Clement  VII,  realized  that  it  was  not  to  the  curia’s  advantage  to  have  to  send 
to  Venice  for  solutions.  He  delegated  all  cryptology  to  Antonio  Elio,  who  was 
able  to  “decipher  with  much  facility”  and  who  later  rose  to  pontifical  secre- 
tary, Bishop  of  Pola,  and  finally  Patriarch  of  Jerusalem.  In  1555  the  title  of 
Cipher  Secretary  was  created,  and  conferred  upon  Triphon  Bencio  de  Assisi; 
it  was  in  1557,  during  his  tenure,  that  cryptanalysts  working  for  the  pope 
solved  a cipher  of  King  Philip  II  of  Spain,  then  warring  briefly  upon  the 
pontiff.  In  1567,  the  Great  Vicar  of  St.  Peter  solved  in  less  than  six  hours  a 
cryptogram  on  “a  large  sheet  of  paper  in  the  Turkish  language,  of  which  he 
did  not  understand  four  words.”  Late  in  the  1580s,  the  cipher  secretaryship 
finally  came  into  the  hands  of  a remarkable  family  of  cryptologists  who  held 
it  for  less  than  20  years,  but  left  their  impress  upon  cryptology. 

These  were  the  Argentis.  Their  forebears  had  come  to  Rome  from  Savona 
about  1475  in  the  hope  of  finding  a sinecure  under  Pope  Sixtus  IV,  a fellow 
townsman ; the  family  lived  in  a house  that  they  had  built  opposite  the  cloister 
of  San  Giacomo  della  Muratte  in  Rome,  near  the  Fountain  of  Trevi.  Giovanni 
Batista  Argenti  entered  the  papal  service  as  a personal  clerk  to  Antonio  Elio, 
who  taught  him  cryptology.  Though  Giovanni  Batista  burned  to  become 
papal  secretary  of  ciphers,  he  had  to  give  way  before  some  nepotistic  claims, 
and  it  was  not  until  he  was  well  into  his  fifties,  after  Sixtus  V became  pope, 
that  Giovanni  Batista  finally  got  his  wish.  By  then  it  was  almost  too  late: 
when  Pope  Gregory  XIV  ascended  the  throne  of  St.  Peter  in  1 590,  he  had  to 
persuade  Argenti  to  retain  the  office  because  of  the  irksome  trips  to  France 
and  Germany  that  it  entailed.  Giovanni  Batista  realized  that  he  was  weaken- 
ing; he  hastened  to  teach  cryptology  to  his  nephew,  Matteo  Argenti,  and 
expired  April  24,  1591. 

Matteo,  30,  succeeded  to  his  uncle’s  office.  Five  popes  renewed  his 
appointment.  He  taught  cryptology  to  his  younger  brother,  Marcello,  who 
was  cipher  secretary  to  a cardinal,  in  the  evident  hope  of  perpetuating  the 
family  in  the  job.  But  Matteo  was  unexpectedly  relieved  of  his  office  on  June 
15,  1 605— apparently  the  victim  of  a power  play  in  the  curia,  for  the  pope 
called  him  in  to  tell  him  that  he  was  not  at  fault  and  to  give  him  a pension  of 


113 


The  Rise  of  the  West 

100  ducats.  Matteo  used  his  new  leisure  to  compile  a 135-page,  calf-bound 
manual  of  cryptology  that  lists  many  of  the  nomenclators  devised  by  his 
uncle  and  that,  out  of  his  own  experience,  summarizes  the  best  in  Renaissance 
cryptology. 

The  Argentis  were  the  first  to  use  a word  as  a mnemonic  key  to  mix  a 
cipher  alphabet,  a practice  that  became  widespread.  They  wrote  out  the  key- 
word, omitting  any  repeated  letters,  then  followed  it  with  the  remaining  letters 
of  the  alphabet : 

pi  et  roabcdfghlmnqsuz 
10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29 

Knowing  that  the  invariable  sequence  of  u after  q in  plaintext  advertises  the 
identity  of  both  letters,  the  Argentis  merged  the  two  into  a single  unit  for 
encipherment  purposes.  Noticing  that  the  frequent  doubled  letters  within 
(Italian)  words  were  always  consonants,  they  deleted  the  second  of  such  a 
pair:  sigillo  would  be  written  sigilo.  They  realized,  of  course,  that  the  basic 
method  of  solving  ciphers  using  homophones,  or  homophonic  substitutions, 
is  to  search  for  partial  repetitions,  such  as: 

13  24  81  66  41 

13  24  49  66  41 

If  these  result  from  the  similar  but  not  identical  encipherments  of  the  same 
word,  then  49  stands  for  the  same  letter  as  81.  Given  sufficient  text,  whole  sets 
of  these  equivalencies  can  be  built  up,  and  the  cryptogram  then  solved  by 
the  ordinary  method  of  letter-frequency.  To  impede  such  comparisons,  the 
Argentis  ordered  nulls  larded  throughout  the  cryptogram  at  a rate  of  no  less 
than  three  to  eight  per  line. 

By  prqhibiting  word  separations,  punctuation  and  accentuation,  and  words 
in  clear,  they  eliminated  all  clues  stemming  from  these  highly  fertile  sources. 
They  ran  alt  the  ciphertext  digits  together  and,  to  make  it  difficult  even  to 
determine  the  proper  ciphertext  numbers,  they  mixed  single  digits  with  pairs, 
so  that  a cryptanalyst  dividing  the  text  into  straight  pairs  would  get  a totally 
false  picture.  They  prevented  confusion  in  deciphering  by  making  sure  that 
digits  used  as  singles  were  excluded  from  those  composing  the  pairs.  Moreover, 
they  cleverly  assigned  the  single  digits  to  high-frequency  plaintext  equivalents 
that  would  raise  the  single  digits’  frequency  in  the  ciphertext  high  enough  that 
they  would  not  stand  out  by  their  rarity.  For  example,  from  a cipher  by 
Matteo: 

abcdefghi  lmnopqrstuzetcon  non  che  nulls 
1 86  02  20  62  22  06  60  3 24  26  84  9 66  68  28  42  80  04  88  08  64  00  44  5,  7 
82  40 

Thus  Argenti  might  be  enciphered  5128068285480377.  They  sometimes  made 
use  of  polyphones — cipher  symbols  that  have  two  or  three  plaintext  meanings. 
These  plaintext  equivalents  were  chosen  so  as  not  to  mislead  the  decipherer, 
but  their  mutual  symbol,  simultaneously  reflecting  two  different  letter 


114  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

personalities,  would  behave  in  a very  schizoid  manner,  quite  puzzling  to  the 
cryptanalyst. 

The  Argentis  did  not  stop  there,  however.  They  fit  the  cipher  to  the  occa- 
sion. If  a cipher  were  to  be  used  to  encipher  Italian,  it  would  not  waste  cipher 
equivalents  on  plaintext  k,  w,  and  y,  which  Italian  does  not  use.  But 
ambassadors  in  Germany  and  Poland  got  alphabets  with  k and  w,  and  those 
in  Spain  had  y in  their  ciphers.  Matteo  remarked  in  a note  that  few  dangers 
existed  for  the  papal  ciphers  in  Poland,  Sweden,  and  Switzerland,  and  that 
the  Germans  knew  so  little  of  cryptology  that  they  preferred  to  burn  inter- 
cepted cryptograms  instead  of  trying  to  solve  them.  Consequently  he  recom- 
mended— and  used — only  simple  systems  in  those  countries.  But  Matteo 
exercised  great  prudence  in  constructing  ciphers  intended  for  use  in  France, 
England,  Venice,  and  Florence — states  for  whose  cryptology  he  professed 
great  admiration. 

Cryptology  was  used  quite  as  widely  as  Matteo  Argenti’s  comments 
indicate.  The  carefully  guarded  sheets  of  folio-sized  paper  on  which  the 
nomenclators  were  neatly  engrossed  were  as  much  an  instrument  of  war  as  the 
arquebus  and,  like  any  other  weapon,  they  followed  their  flags  to  all  parts  of 
the  world,  multiplying  in  direct  proportion  to  conquests.  Nowhere  is  this 
more  evident  than  with  Spain.  Her  ascent  to  power  can  be  traced  in  the 
proliferation  of  her  ciphers,  and  these  project  an  interesting  image  of  the 
cryptology  of  the  day,  as  practiced  by  the  richest  and  mightiest  nation  in 
Europe. 

Knowledge  of  cryptology  had  filtered  into  Iberia  at  just  about  the  time 
that  Ferdinand  and  Isabella  expelled  the  Moors  and  set  their  unified  country 
on  the  road  to  world  supremacy.  The  first  systems,  introduced  in  1480  by 
councilor  Miguel  Perez  Alzaman,  transformed  plaintext  into  Roman  numerals. 
These  proved  so  clumsy  that  many  decipherments  bear  such  marginal  notes 
as  “Nonsense,”  “Impossible,”  “Cannot  be  understood,”  and  “Order  the 
ambassador  to  send  another  dispatch.”  It  may  have  been  in  one  of  these 
systems  that  Christopher  Columbus  in  the  New  World  in  1498  reportedly 
wrote  to  his  brother  to  fight  off  a governor  sent  from  Spain — a cipher  letter 
that  was  used  as  a reason  for  the  governor’s  sending  Columbus  back  to  Spain 
in  chains.  After  Isabella  died  in  1504,  simpler  systems  were  instituted  for  th$ 
increasing  number  of  Spanish  envoys.  Nothing  much  was  done  thereafter  until 
the  shrewd,  morose,  arrogant,  and  fanatic  Philip  II  ascended  the  throne  of 
Spain.  On  May  24,  1556,  four  months  after  he  became  king  and  three  days 
after  his  29th  birthday,  Philip,  who  personally  supervised  the  minutest  details 
of  his  administration,  wrote  his  uncle,  the  Holy  Roman  Emperor  Ferdinand 
I,  king  of  Hungary,  that  he  had  decided  to  change  the  ciphers  used  during  the 
reign  of  his  father,  Charles  V,  because  they  had  fallen  into  disuse  or  had  been 
compromised.  He  asked  his  uncle  to  use  a new  cipher  that  he  was  sending 
him  together  with  a list  of  persons  who  held  the  key.

The  Rise  of  the  West 

Philip’s  first  cipher,  the  new  general  cipher  of  1556,  was  one  of  the  best 
nomenclators  of  the  day.  It  comprised  a table  of  homophonic  letter  substitu- 
tions (two  symbols  for  consonants,  three  for  vowels),  a list  of  equivalents  for 
common  digraphs  and  trigraphs  (each  digraph  was  represented  by  both  a 
symbol  and  a two-digit  number),  a small  code  in  which  words  and  titles  were 
represented  by  two-  and  three-letter  groups,  and  a provision  that  symbols 
with  a single  dot  above  them  were  nulls  and  that  those  with  two  dots  above 
them  represented  a doubled  letter.  It  set  the  pattern  for  Spanish  cryptography 
well  into  the  17th  century,  though  the  separate  sections  of  the  nomenclator 
tended  to  coalesce,  the  symbols  to  give  way  to  numbers,  and  the  code  section 
to  enlarge  until  repertories  of  1,000  elements  were  not  uncommon.  Not  every

The  earliest  New  World  cryptogram  extant:  a cipher  message  of  Hernan  Cortes, 
June  25,  1532 

nomenclator  was  as  complicated,  for  Philip,  like  Soro,  divided  his  systems 
into  two  classes:  the  cifra  general,  used  for  intercommunication  among 
ambassadors  in  many  countries  and  with  the  king;  and  the  cifra  particular, 
used  by  Philip  with  an  individual  envoy.  Ciphers  were  changed  every  three  or 
four  years;  the  cifra  general  of  1614  was  replaced  in  1618,  for  example,  and 
the  cifra  particular  of  1604  with  the  ministers  in  Italy  indicated  on  its  face  that 
it  was  to  serve  only  from  1605  to  1609.  Numerous  separate  nomenclators  were 
compiled  for  correspondence  with  the  viceroys  and  governors  of  the  new 
colonies  in  the  Americas.  They  hid  their  reports  of  impending  shipments  of 
gold  beneath  ciphers  to  foil  pirates  who  might  capture  a galleon  and  its 
dispatches.  This  practice  began  as  early  as  the  conquistadores.  The  oldest 
instance  extant  of  New  World  cryptography  is  a letter  from  Hernan  Cortes, 
dated  June  25,  1532,  from  the  Mexico  he  had  recently  subdued.  Cortes  used 
a small  nomenclator,  comprising  a homophonic  monalphabetic substitution 
in  which  each  letter  was  represented  by  two  or  three  symbols,  together  with  a 
few  codewords  for  proper  names. 

Spain  administered  its  cryptography  in  the  Despacho  Universal,  the  nerve 


116 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


center  of  the  government,  from  which  couriers  departed  at  all  hours  of  the 
day  and  night  for  all  parts  of  the  world.  When  the  capital  was  moved  to 
Madrid  in  1561,  the  Despacho  was  installed  in  the  Alcazar  with  Foreign 
Secretary  Gonzalo  Perez  in  charge. 

Decipherment  in  the  intrigue-filled  court  of  Spain  did  not  rest  solely  on  a 
mere  mechanical  operation  of  cryptographic  rules.  If  an  ambassador  re- 
quested the  payment  of  his  salary  or  solicited  a bishopric,  and  the  deciphering 
secretary  was  not  his  friend,  the  passage  might  remain  undeciphered.  Philip 
himself  ordered  the  deciphering  secretaries  to  suppress  passages  that  he  did 
not  want  his  council  to  know  about.  On  top  of  these  sins  of  omission  were 
piled  those  of  commission,  sometimes  so  serious  that  in  at  least  one  instance 
the  codeword  for  king  of  England  was  confounded  with  that  for  king  of  France ! 

The  sweet  smell  of  success  in  cryptanalysis  never  wafted  through  the 
Moorish  chambers  of  the  Alcazar.  But  Philip’s  archfoes— Protestant  England, 
France  with  its  Huguenot  king,  and  the  rebellious  Spanish  provinces  of  the 
Netherlands — did  not  blind  themselves  to  this  providential  source  of  informa- 
tion. Their  cryptanalytic  abilities  had  a pope  and  most  of  Europe  snickering 
at  Philip,  played  no  small  role  in  foiling  his  grandiose  plans  for  the  conquest 
and  conversion  of  England,  and  helped  ultimately  to  execute  a sentence  of 
death  on  that  most  romantic  and  captivating  of  royal  ladies,  Philip’s  intended 
sister-in-law,  Mary,  Queen  of  Scots. 

In  1589,  Henry  of  Navarre,  who  was  destined  to  become  the  most  popular 
king  in  the  history  of  France  (he  coined  the  slogan  “A  chicken  in  every 
peasant’s  pot  every  Sunday”),  ascended  to  the  throne  as  Henry  IV  and  found 
himself  embroiled  still  more  fiercely  in  his  bitter  contest  with  the  Holy  League, 
a Catholic  faction  that  refused  to  concede  that  a Protestant  could  wear  the 
crown.  The  League,  headed  by  the  Duke  of  Mayenne,  held  Paris  and  all  the 
other  large  cities  of  France,  and  was  receiving  large  transfusions  of  men  and 
money  from  Philip  of  Spain.  Henry  was  tightly  hemmed  in,  and  it  was  at  this 
juncture  that  some  correspondence  between  Philip  and  two  of  his  liaison 
officers,  Commander  Juan  de  Moreo  and  Ambassador  Manosse,  fell  into 
Henry’s  hands. 

It  was  in  cipher,  but  he  had  in  his  government  at  the  time  one  Francois 
Viete,  the  seigneur  de  la  Bigotiere,  a 49-year-old  lawyer  from  Poitou  who  had 
risen  to  become  counselor  of  the  parlement,  or  court  of  justice,  of  Tours  and  a 
privy  counselor  to  Henry.  Viete  had  for  years  amused  himself  with  mathe- 
matics as  a hobby — “Never  was  a man  more  born  for  mathematics,”  said 
Tallement  des  Reaux.  As  the  man  who  first  used  letters  for  quantities  in 
algebra,  giving  that  study  its  characteristic  look,  Viete  is  today  remembered 
as  the  Father  of  Algebra.  A year  before,  he  had  solved  a Spanish  dispatch 
addressed  to  Alessandro  Farnese,  the  Duke  of  Parma,  who  headed  the 
Spanish  forces  of  the  League.  Henry  turned  the  new  intercepts  over  to  him 
to  see  if  Viete  could  repeat  his  success. 


117 


The  Rise  of  the  West 

He  could  and  did.  The  plaintext  of  the  long  letter  from  Moreo,  in  parti- 
cular, was  filled  with  intimate  details  of  the  negotiations  with  Mayenne: 
“.  . . Your  Majesty  having  66,000  men  in  those  states  [the  Netherlands],  it 
would  be  nothing  to  allot  6,000  to  so  pressing  a need.  Should  your  refusal 
become  known,  all  will  be  lost.  ...  I said  nothing  about  that  to  the  Duke  of 
Parma.  . . . The  Duke  of  Mayenne  stated  to  me  that  it  was  his  wish  to  become 
king;  I could  not  hold  back  my  surprise.  . . .”  The  message  was  couched  in  a 
new  nomenclator  that  Philip  had  specially  given  Moreo  when  he  departed 
for  France;  it  consisted  of  the  usual  alphabet  with  homophonic  substitutions, 
plus  a code  list  of  413  terms  represented  by  groups  of  two  or  three  letters 
(lo  = Spain',  pul.  = Navarre',  pom  = King  of  Spain)  or  of  two  numbers,  either 
underlined  (64  = confederation)  or  dotted  (94  = Your  Majesty).  A line 
above  a two-digit  group  indicated  a null. 

Moreo’s  letter  had  been  dated  October  28,  1589,  and  despite  Viete’s 
experience  and  the  quantity  of  text,  it  was  not  until  March  15  of  the  following 
year  that  Viete  was  able  to  send  Henry  the  completed  solution,  though  he  had 
previously  submitted  bits  and  pieces.  What  Viete  did  not  know  was  that,  110 
miles  from  Tours,  Henry  had  defeated  Mayenne’s  superior  force  at  Ivry 
west  of  Paris  the  day  before,  making  the  solution  somewhat  academic. 

Any  chagrin  that  Viete  felt  did  not  deter  him  from  extending  his  crypt- 
analytic successes.  As  he  wrote  to  Henry  in  the  letter  forwarding  the  Moreo 
solution:  “And  do  not  get  anxious  that  this  will  be  an  occasion  for  your 
enemies  to  change  their  ciphers  and  to  remain  more  covert.  They  have 
changed  and  rechanged  them,  and  nevertheless  have  been  and  always  will  be 
discovered  in  their  tricks.”  It  was  an  accurate  prediction,  for  Viete  continued 
to  read  the  enciphered  messages  of  Spain  and  of  other  principalities  as  well. 
But  his  pride  led  him  straight  into  a trap  in  which  a shrewd  diplomat  drew 
confidential  information  from  him  as  deftly  as  he  elicited  the  secret  meaning 
from  elegant  and  mysterious  symbols.  Giovanni  Mocenigo,  the  Venetian 
ambassador  to  France,  said  that  he  was  talking  one  day  with  Viete  at 
Tours: 

He  [Viete]  had  just  told  me  that  a great  number  of  letters  in  cipher  of  the 
king  of  Spain  as  well  as  of  the  [Holy  Roman]  Emperor  and  of  other  princes  had 
been  intercepted,  which  he  had  deciphered  and  interpreted.  And  as  I showed  a 
great  deal  of  astonishment,  he  said  to  me: 

“I  will  give  your  government  effective  proofs  of  it.” 

He  immediately  brought  me  a thick  packet  of  letters  from  the  said  princes 
which  he  had  deciphered,  and  added : 

“I  want  you  also  to  know  that  1 know  and  translate  your  cipher.” 

“I  will  not  believe  it,”  I said,  “unless  I see  it.” 

And  as  I had  three  kinds  of  cipher — an  ordinary  which  I used,  a different  one 
which  I did  not  use,  and  a third,  called  dalle  Caselle — he  showed  me  that  he  knew 
the  first.  Then,  to  better  probe  so  grave  an  affair,  I said  to  him, 

“You  undoubtedly  know  our  dalle  Caselle  cipher?" 

“For  that,  you  have  to  skip  a lot,”  he  replied,  meaning  that  he  only  knew 


118 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


portions  of  it.  I asked  him  to  let  me  see  some  of  our  deciphered  letters,  and  he 
promised  to  let  me,  but  since  then  he  has  not  spoken  further  about  it  to  me,  and, 
having  left,  I have  not  seen  him  any  more. 

Mocenigo  was  reporting  to  the  Council  of  Ten,  and  it  was  after  hearing  his 
remarks  that  they  so  promptly  replaced  their  existing  keys. 

Meanwhile,  Philip  had  learned,  from  his  own  interceptions  of  French 
letters,  that  Viete  had  broken  a cipher  that  the  Spanish — who  apparently 
knew  little  about  cryptanalysis — had  thought  unbreakable.  It  irritated  him, 
and,  thinking  that  he  would  cause  trouble  for  the  French  at  no  cost  to  himself, 
told  the  pope  that  Henry  could  have  read  his  ciphers  only  by  black  magic. 
But  the  tactic  boomeranged.  The  pope,  cognizant  of  the  ability  of  his  own 
cryptologist,  Giovanni  Batista  Argenti,  and  perhaps  even  aware  that  papal 
cryptanalysts  had  themselves  solved  one  of  Philip’s  ciphers  30  years  before, 
did  nothing  about  the  Spaniard’s  complaint;  all  Philip  got  for  his  effort  was 
the  ridicule  and  derision  of  everyone  who  heard  about  it. 

One  of  those  who  must  have  been  laughing  the  hardest  was  probably  a 
50-year-old  Flemish  nobleman  who  had  himself  just  completed  solving  a 
cipher  of  Spain.  This  was  Philip  van  Marnix,  Baron  de  Sainte-Aldegonde, 
right-hand  man  of  William  of  Orange,  who  led  the  united  Dutch  and  Flemish 
revolt  against  Spain.  Marnix,  an  intimate  of  John  Calvin  and  composer  of 
what  is  today  the  Dutch  national  anthem,  was  also  a brilliant  cryptanalyst. 
An  adversary  described  him  as  “noble,  wise,  gracious,  sagacious,  eloquent, 
experienced  and  with  a very  acute  understanding,  knowing  the  finer  points  of 
dealing  with  people.  He  is  learned  in  Greek,  Hebrew,  Latin;  he  understands 
and  writes  the  Spanish,  Italian,  German,  French,  Flemish,  English,  Scottish, 
and  other  languages  very  easily — better  than  any  other  man  of  this  country. 
He  is  about  40  years  old,  of  medium  height,  of  dark  complexion,  but  ugly  of 
face.  He  is  the  greatest  and  most  constant  anti-Catholic  in  the  world,  more 
than  even  Calvin  himself.” 

The  Spanish  cipher  message  that  Marnix  solved  had  been  intercepted  by 
Henry  IV  during  his  siege  of  Paris.  The  writer  was,  as  with  Viete’s  solution, 
the  luckless  Juan  de  Moreo;  the  addressee  was,  as  before.  King  Philip. 
Marnix  had  joined  Henry  at  the  siege;  his  reputation  had  apparently  preceded 
him,  for  the  French  king  himself  turned  over  the  three-and-a-half  page  crypto- 
gram to  his  Protestant  ally.  Marnix’s  solution  revealed  some  of  the  jealous 
Moreo’s  vituperations  against  the  Duke  of  Parma  (who  served  also  as  the 
Spanish  governor  of  the  Low  Countries),  accusing  him  in  venomous  terms  of 
subverting  Philip’s  programs  there.  Henry  had  Marnix  send  both  the  decrypt- 
ment  and  the  substantiating  ciphertext  to  the  duke  in  August  of  1590,  in  the 
faint  hope  of  stirring  up  some  discord;  the  duke,  who  knew  of  Moreo’s 
calumnies  and  considered  them  beneath  his  contempt,  found  Marnix’s 
solution  of  sufficient  interest  to  preserve  it,  but  took  none  of  the  hoped-for 
actions. 

It  was  not  the  first  time  that  Marnix  had  solved  Spanish  ciphers.  Thirteen 


119 


The  Rise  of  the  West 

years  before  he  had  done  it,  and  his  demonstration  of  the  value  of  crypt- 
analysis set  in  motion  a train  of  events  that  culminated  on  a headsman’s  block. 

In  1577,  Philip  was  ruling  the  Netherlands  through  his  half  brother,  Don 
Juan  of  Austria,  its  governor.  The  ambitions  of  Don  Juan,  then  the  first 
warrior  of  Christendom  by  virtue  of  his  crushing  defeat  of  the  Turks  at 
Lepanto,  were  not  to  be  circumscribed  by  those  constricted  borders.  He 
dreamed  of  crossing  the  Channel  into  England  with  a body  of  troops,  de- 
throning Elizabeth,  then  marrying  the  seductive  Mary,  Queen  of  Scots,  and 
sharing  a Catholic  crown  of  England  with  her.  Philip  consented  to  the  inva- 
sion and  the  marriage,  both  to  be  begun  as  soon  as  Juan  had  restored  peace  in 
the  Netherlands. 

But  England  did  not  sleep.  Sir  Francis  Walsingham,  Elizabeth’s  satanic- 
looking  minister,  had  built  up  an  efficient  organization  for  secret  intelligence 
that  reportedly  had  53  agents  in  its  pay  on  the  Continent  at  one  time.  Wal- 
singham first  got  wind  that  something  was  afoot  when  he  heard  of  the  marriage 
proposal.  But  his  suspicions  remained  unconfirmed  until  the  Huguenot  general 
Frangois  de  la  Noue  intercepted  some  of  Don  Juan’s  enciphered  letters  in 
Gascony  near  the  end  of  June,  1577.  Since  they  presumably  dealt  with  affairs 
in  the  Low  Countries,  they  were  sent  to  authorities  there. 

Somehow  they  reached  Marnix.  Within  a month  he  had  broken  the  cipher. 
It  was  a typical  Spanish  nomenclator  of  the  period,  with  a total  vocabulary  of 
about  200  words,  the  usual  syllabary,  and  an  alphabet.  A peculiarity  was  that 
each  plaintext  vowel  was  given,  in  addition  to  its  one  literal  and  two  numerical 
substitutes,  a swash  symbol  as  a substitute.  Then,  if  a consonant  preceded  a 
vowel,  this  flourish  was  joined  to  the  consonant’s  ciphertext  number  to  form 
a single  combined  character  representing  the  two  letters. 

The  solutions  seem  to  have  all  but  disclosed  Juan's  plan  of  landing  his 
Spanish  veterans  in  England  under  the  guise  of  seeking  refuge  from  storms 
that  had  blown  him  off  course.  William  of  Orange  revealed  the  contents  to 
Daniel  Rogers,  one  of  Walsingham’s  agents,  at  a dinner  at  Alkmaar  on  July 
1 1,  in  an  attempt  to  persuade  Elizabeth  to  come  to  his  aid.  Wrote  Rogers  in 
his  report  to  Walsingham : 

The  Prince  [William]  told  me  this  that  her  Majesty  might  perceive  how  this 
negotiation  of  Don  John  and  the  Pope’s  Nuncio  agreed  with  the  letters  written 
by  Don  John  and  Escovedo  [Juan’s  secretary]  in  April  last,  and  now  intercepted. 
With  that  he  called  for  M.  de  Sainte-“Allagunde,”  whom  he  would  have  to  bring 
the  letters  with  him.  . . . Sainte-Aldegonde  brought  nine  letters,  written  all  in 
Spanish,  the  most  part  of  every  one  in  cipher,  excepting  one.  Three  of  these  were 
written  by  Don  John,  two  of  them  to  the  King  [of  Spain],  the  third  to  the  King’s 
Secretary,  Antonio  Perez.  The  rest  were  all  written  by  Escovedo  to  the  King;  it 
appeared  by  the  seals  and  signatures  they  were  no  forged  letters.  The  Prince  also 
showed  me  the  letter  of  La  Noue,  in  which  were  enclosed  all  the  said  letters,  as 
he  had  intercepted  them  in  France.  1 thought  good  to  pick  out  of  them  notes  of 
the  chief  things  contained  in  them.

This  report  gave  England  tangible  evidence  of  Philip’s  aggressive  inten- 
tions and  perhaps  provoked  an  increased  watchfulness  that  served  England  in 
good  stead  when  Philip  finally  did  mount  his  invasion  attempt  in  the  Grand

Philip  van  Mar  nix's  solution  of  a nomenclator  used  by  Don  Juan  de  Austria,  in  1577 

Armada  eleven  years  later.  Juan’s  plot  came  to  naught  because  he  failed  to 
negotiate  peace  with  the  rebels,  which  he  needed  before  he  could  begin  with 
England.  But  Walsingham,  having  learned  of  Marnix’s  rare  talent,  induced 


121 


The  Rise  of  the  West 

the  nobleman  to  solve  messages  for  him.  On  March  20,  1578,  he  wrote 
to  William  Davison,  an  English  agent  in  Flanders:  “It  is  very  important 
to  her  Majesty’s  service  to  have  this  letter  of  the  ambassador  of  Portugal 
deciphered  with  speed.  Please  therefore  deal  earnestly  and  speedily  with 
St.  Alagondye  in  that  behalf.  The  cipher  is  so  easy  that  it  requires  no  great 
trouble.” 

For  once  the  sanguine  expectations  of  a superior  concerning  the  lack  of 
difficulty  of  an  assigned  task  proved  correct.  On  April  5,  Davison  replied: 
“Sainte-Aldegonde  is  this  day  gone  toward  Worms.  . . . His  leisure  before 
going  did  not  suffice  to  decipher  the  letters  you  sent  me  with  your  last,  but  he 
procured  me  another  to  perform  it.  I send  it  herewith.  . . .”  The  lengthy  letter 
revealed  the  ambassador  complaining  to  his  king  about  how  Elizabeth  feigned 
illness  to  avoid  an  audience  he  was  seeking. 

Walsingham  must  have  been  dazzled  by  possibilities  he  never  suspected 
when  he  first  received  Marnix’s  solutions,  for  he  took  steps  to  assure  himself 
of  the  rich  flow  of  information  provided  by  cryptanalysis  without  having  to 
depend  on  foreign  experts.  Later  that  very  year  he  had  a bright  young  man  in 
Paris  devouring  enciphered  messages.  This  was  Thomas  Phelippes,  England’s 
first  great  cryptanalyst. 

Phelippes  was  the  son  of  London’s  collector  of  customs,  a not  inconse- 
quential post  to  which  he  himself  later  succeeded.  He  traveled  widely  in 
France,  probably  as  a roving  representative  for  Walsingham.  On  his  return, 
he  became  one  of  the  minister’s  most  confidential  assistants.  He  was  an 
indefatigable  worker,  corresponding  tirelessly  in  his  calligraphic  hand  with 
Walsingham’s  numerous  agents.  His  letters  show  a fair  acquaintance  with 
literary  allusions  and  classical  quotations,  and  he  appears  to  have  been  able 
to  solve  ciphers  in  Latin,  French,  and  Italian  and,  less  proficiently,  in  Spanish. 
The  only  known  physical  description  of  him  comes  from  the  pen  of  Mary  of 
Scots  herself,  who  describes  Phelippes,  whose  hair  and  beard  were  blond,  as 
“of  low  stature,  slender  every  way,  eated  in  the  face  with  small  pocks,  of  short 
sight,  thirty  years  of  age  by  appearance.” 

Mary’s  unflattering  comments  betrayed  her  suspicions  about  Phelippes — 
suspicions  that  were  well  founded.  For  Phelippes  and  his  master,  Walsing- 
ham, were  casting  a jaundiced  eye  on  Mary  for  reasons  that,  in  their  turn,  were 
equally  well  founded.  Mary  was  the  heir  apparent  to  the  throne  of  England. 
She  was  also  onrmwd-ftQieen  of  Scotland,  though  she  had  been  ejected  in  a 
tangled  series  of  events  and  had  been  prevented  from  returning  by  the  opposi- 
tion of  the  strong  Protestant  party  A^^o  her  She  was  a 

remarkable  woman:  beautiful,  possessed  of  great  personal  charm,  command- 
ing the  loyalty  of  her  subordinates,  courageous,  unshakably  devoted  to  her 
religion,  but  also  unwise,  stubborn,  and  capricious.  Various  Catholic  factions 
had  schemed  more  than  once  to  seat  her  on  the  throne^of  England  and  so 
restore  the  realm  to  the  Church.  The  chief  result  had  been  toTOffiflne  Mary  to 
various  castles  in  England  and  to  alert  Walsingham  to  seek  an  opportunity  to 


122  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

extirpate  once  and  for  all  this  cancer  that  threatened  to  destroy  his  own  quoS?**^ 
Elizabeth. 

The  opportunity  arose  in  1586.  A former  page  of  Mary’s,  Anthony 
Babington,  began  organizing  a plot  to  have  courtiers  assassinate  Elizabeth, 
incite  a general  Catholic  uprising  in  England,  and  crown  Mary.  A conspiracy 
that  involved  the  overthrow  of  the  government  naturally  had  ramifications 
all  over  the  country,  and  Babington  also  gained  the  support  of  Philip  II,  who 
promised  to  send  an  expedition  to  help,  once  Elizabeth  was  safely  dead.  But 
the  plan  depended  ultimately  on  the  acquiescence  of  Mary,  and  to  obtain  this 
Babington  had  to  communicate  with  her. 

This  was  no  easy  task.  Mary  was  then  being  held  incommunicado  under 
house  arrest  at  the  country  estate  of  Chartley.  But  a handsome  former  semina- 
rian named  Gilbert  Gifford,  recruited  by  Babington  as  a messenger,  dis- 
covered a way  of  smuggling  Mary’s  letters  into  Chartley  in  a beer  keg.  It 
worked  so  well  that  the  French  ambassador  gave  Gifford  all  the  correspond- 
ence that  had  been  accumulating  for  Mary  for  the  past  two  years. 

Much  of  it  was  enciphered.  But  this  was  only  part  of  the  care  that  Mary 
took  to  ensure  the  security  of  her  communications.  She  insisted  that  import- 
ant letters  be  written  within  her  suite  and  read  to  her  before  they  were  en- 
ciphered. Dispatches  had  to  be  sealed  in  her  presence.  The  actual  encipher- 
ment was  usually  performed  by  Gilbert  Curll,  her  trusted  secretary,  less 
often  by  Jacques  Nau,  another  secretary.  Mary  not  infrequently  ordered 
changes  in  her  nomenclators,  which  were  much  smaller  and  flimsier  than  the 
diplomatic  ones. 

What  neither  Mary  nor  Babington  knew  was  that,  despite  their  elaborate 
precautions,  their  correspondence  was  being  delivered  to  Walsingham  and 
Phelippes  as  quickly  as  they  wrote  it.  Gilbert  Gifford  was  a double-agent,  a 
ne’er-do-well  who  had  offered  his  services  to  Walsingham.  Walsingham,  see- 
ing an  unparalleled  opportunity  to  insinuate  his  antennae  into  Mary’s  circles, 
employed  Gifford  to  turn  over  to  him  all  Mary’s  letters,  which  he  copied  and 
then  passed  on.  It  included  the  two-year  backlog  entrusted  to  Gifford  by  the 
French  ambassador,  and  the  rapidly  growing  volume  of  traffic  generated  by 
Babington’s  festering  plot.  These  enciphered  missives  were  being  solved  by 
Phelippes  almost  as  quickly  as  he  got  his  hands  on  them.  As  the  conspiracy 
reached  a crescendo  of  preparation  in  the  middle  of  July,  he  was  sometimes 
reading  two  or  more  in  a day:  two  letters  from  the  queen  bear  notations 
“decifred  18  July  1586,”  two  others  are  marked  as  deciphered  July  21,  and 
there  are  still  other  cipher  letters  in  the  same  packet  in  the  records  that  bear 
no  notations. 

During  these  three  months,  Walsingham  cannily  made  no  arrests,  but 
simply  let  the  plot  develop  and  the  correspondence  accumulate  in  the  hope 
that  Mary  would  incriminate  herself.  His  expectations  were  fulfilled.  Early  in 
July,  Babington  spfeSi'fie^  the  beta'll!  of  the  plan  in  a letter  to  Mary,  referring 
to  the  Spanish  invasion,  her  own  deliverance,  and  “the  dispatch  of  the 


123 


The  Rise  of  the  West 

usurping  competitor.”  Mary  considered  her  reply  for  a week  and,  after 
composing  it  carefully,  had  Curll  encipher  it;  she  sent  it  off  to  Babington  on 
July  17.  It  was  to  prove  fatal,  for  in  it  Mary  acknowledged  “this  enterprise” 
and  advised  Babington  of  ways  “to  bring  it  to  good  success.”  Phelippes,  on 
solving  it,  immediately  endorsed  it  with  the  gallows  mark. 

But  Walsingham  still  lacked  the  names  of  the  six  young  courtiers  who  were 
to  commit  the  actual  assassination.  So  when  the  letter  reached  Babington,  it 
bore  a postscript  that  was  not  on  it  when  it  left  Mary’s  hands;  in  it  Babington 
was  asked  for  “the  names  and  qualities  of  the  six  gentlemen  which  are  to 
accomplish  the  designment.”  Both  the  forgery  and  the  encipherment  in  the 
correct  key  seem  to  be  the  work  of  Phelippes. 

It  proved  unnecessary.  Babington  needed  to  go  abroad  to  organize  the 
invasion;  at  Walsingham’s  suggestion,  there  was  a mix-up  in  the  passports. 
Babington,  suspecting  nothing,  boldly  came  to  the  minister  for  help  in  cutting

saying  he  was  going  to  pay  the  bar  bill  and  leaving  his  cloak  and  sword  on 
the  back  of  his  chair,  he  slipped  out  and  escaped.  The  hue  and  cry  set  up  by

ON  THE  ORIGIN  OF  A SPECIES 


“dato  and  I were  strolling  in  the  Supreme  Pontiff’s  gardens  at  the  Vatican 
and  we  got  to  talking  about  literature  as  we  so  often  do,  and  we  found  our- 
selves greatly  admiring  the  German  inventor  who  today  can  take  up  to  three 
original  works  of  an  author  and,  by  means  of  movable  type  characters,  can 
within  100  days  turn  out  more  than  200  copies.  In  a single  contact  of  his  press 
he  can  reproduce  a copy  of  an  entire  page  of  a large  manuscript.  And  so  we 
went  from  topic  to  topic  marveling  at  the  ingenuity  that  men  showed  in 
various  enterprises,  till  Dato  gave  expression  to  his  warm  admiration  for 
those  men  who  can  exploit  what  are  called  ‘ciphers.’  ” 

So  wrote  Leon  Battista  Alberti  near  the  beginning  of  the  succinct  but 
suggestive  work  that  earned  him  the  title  of  Father  of  Western  Cryptology. 
Alberti  was  the  first  of  a group  of  writers  who,  element  by  element,  developed 
a type  of  cipher  to  which  most  of  today’s  systems  of  cryptography  belong. 
The  species  is  polyalphabetic  substitution. 

As  the  name  implies,  it  involves  two  or  more  cipher  alphabets.  Because  the 
different  alphabets  use  the  same  symbols  (usually  letters)  for  ciphertext,  a 
given  symbol  can  represent  different  plaintext  letters,  depending  on  which 
alphabet  is  being  used.  This  naturally  will  confuse  the  cryptanalyst,  which  of 
course  is  the  point.  But  it  could  also  confuse  the  cryptographer,  unless  he 
knew  which  alphabet  was  then  in  use,  and  this  knowledge  implies  some  kind 
of  rotation  or  rule  for  bringing  the  alphabets  into  play.  All  this  differs  from 
the  simple  use  of  homophones  or  their  much  rarer  opposites,  polyphones.  A 
given  homophone  always  represents  the  same  plaintext  letter,  and  a given 
polyphone  always  represents  the  same  choice  of  plaintext  letters,  usually  two 
or  three  at  the  most.  Their  relation  to  their  plaintext  elements  remains  fixed. 
In  polyalphabetic  substitution  the  relationship  is  variable.  It  thus  marked  a 
great  stride  forward  in  cryptology,  though  it  did  not  supplant  the  nomenclator 
in  political  cryptography  for  more  than  400  years.  In  the  20th  century,  the 
ways  of  varying  the  plain-to-cipher  relationship  reached  such  proportions  of 
complexity  as  to  afford  cryptographers  guarantees  of  extraordinary  security. 

It  was  the  amateurs  of  cryptology  who  created  the  species.  The  profes- 
sionals, who  almost  certainly  surpassed  them  in  cryptanalytic  expertise, 
concentrated  on  the  down-to-earth  problems  of  the  systems  that  were  then 

125 


126 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


in  use  but  are  now  outdated.  The  amateurs,  unfettered  to  these  realities, 
soared  into  the  empyrean  of  theory.  There  were  four  whose  thought  took 
wings : a famous  architect,  an  intellectual  cleric,  an  ecclesiastical  courtier,  and 
a natural  scientist. 

The  architect  was  Alberti,  a man  who,  perhaps  better  than  anyone  except 
Leonardo  da  Vinci,  epitomizes  the  Renaissance  ideal  of  the  universal  man. 
Born  in  1404,  the  illegitimate  but  favored  son  of  a family  of  rich  Florentine 
merchants,  Alberti  enjoyed  extraordinary  intellectual  and  athletic  aptitudes. 
His  family  cultivated  these  with  lavish  care,  educating  him  in  the  law  at  the 
University  of  Bologna  and  sending  him  on  a grand  tour  of  Europe  in  his  mid- 
twenties. A severe  illness  that  caused  a partial  loss  of  memory  interrupted  a 
career  which  might  have  led  to  a bishopric,  and  Alberti  turned  his  attention 
from  law  to  arts  and  sciences.  As  an  architect,  he  completed  the  Pitti  Palace, 
erected  the  first  Fountain  of  Trevi  in  Rome  (since  replaced  in  a renovation), 
and  constructed,  among  many  other  buildings,  the  church  of  Sant’Andrea  at 
Mantua,  which  served  as  the  model  for  many  Renaissance  churches,  and  the 
temple  of  Malatesta  at  Rimini. 

His  talent  was  universal.  He  painted,  composed  music,  and  was  regarded 
as  one  of  the  best  organists  of  his  day.  He  was  given  one  of  the  leading  roles  in 
an  imaginary  philosophical  dialogue.  Writings  poured  from  his  pen:  poems, 
fables,  comedies,  a treatise  on  the  fly,  a funeral  oration  for  his  dog,  a mis- 
ogynistic  essay  on  cosmetics  and  coquetry,  the  first  scientific  investigation  of 
perspective,  books  on  morality,  law,  philosophy,  family  life,  sculpture,  and 
painting.  His  De  Re  Aedificatoria,  the  first  printed  book  on  architecture, 
written  while  Gothic  churches  were  still  being  built,  helped  shape  the  thoughts 
of  those  who  built  such  utterly  non-Gothic  structures  as  St.  Peter’s  Basilica 
in  Rome.  It  stands  as  “the  theoretical  cornerstone  of  the  architecture  of  the 
Renaissance.”  Alberti  was  a superb  athlete,  supposedly  able  to  fling  a coin  so 
it  rang  against  the  high  vault  of  a cathedral  and  capable  of  riding  the  wildest 
horses.  Jacob  Burckhardt,  author  of  the  classic  The  Civilization  of  the  Renais- 
sance in  Italy,  singled  out  Alberti  as  one  of  the  truly  all-sided  men  who  tower 
above  their  numerous  many-sided  contemporaries.  And  another  great  Renais- 
sance scholar,  John  Symonds,  declared  that  “He  presents  the  spirit  of  the 
15th  century  at  its  very  best.” 

Among  his  friends  was  the  pontifical  secretary,  Leonardo  Dato,  one  of  the 
learned  men  of  his  age,  who  during  that  memorable  stroll  in  the  Vatican 
gardens  brought  the  conversation  around  to  cryptology.  “You've  always  been 
interested  in  these  secrets  of  nature,”  Dato  said.  “What  do  you  think  of  these 
decipherers?  Have  you  tried  your  hand  at  it,  as  much  as  you  know  how  to?” 

Alberti  smiled.  He  knew  that  Dato’s  duties  included  ciphers  (it  was  before 
the  curia  had  a separate  cipher  secretary).  “You’re  the  head  of  the  papal 
secretariat,”  he  teased.  “Could  it  be  that  you  had  to  use  these  things  a few 
times  in  matters  of  great  importance  to  His  Holiness?” 


127 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

“That’s  why  I brought  it  up,”  Dato  replied  candidly.  “And  because  of  the 
post  I have,  I want  to  be  able  to  do  it  myself  without  having  to  use  outside 
interpreters.  For  when  they  bring  me  letters  in  cipher  intercepted  by  spies, 
it’s  no  joking  matter.  So  please — if  you’ve  thought  up  any  new  ideas  having 
to  do  with  this  business,  tell  me  about  them.”  So  Alberti  promised  that  he 
would  do  some  work  on  it  so  that  Dato  would  see  that  it  was  profitable  to 
have  asked  him,  and  the  result  was  the  essay  that  he  wrote  in  1466  or  early 
1467,  when  he  was  62  or  63. 

He  implied  that  he  thought  up  the  idea  of  frequency  analysis  all  by  himself, 
but  the  conception  that  he  set  forth  is  far  too  matured  for  that.  Nevertheless, 
his  remarkably  lucid  Latin  essay,  totaling  about  25  manuscript  pages,  con- 
stitutes the  West’s  oldest  extant  text  on  cryptanalysis.  “First  I shall  consider 
the  number  of  letters  and  the  phenomena  which  depend  on  the  rules  of  num- 
ber,” he  wrote  at  the  start  of  his  analysis.  “Here  the  vowels  claim  first  place. 

. . . Without  a vowel  there  is  no  syllable.  It  follows  that  if  you  take  a page  of 
some  [Latin]  poet  or  dramatist  and  make  separate  counts  of  the  vowels  and 
consonants  in  the  lines,  you  will  be  sure  to  find  the  vowels  very  numerous.  . . . 
If  all  the  vowels  of  a page  were  put  together,  to  the  number  of,  say,  300,  the 
number  of  all  the  consonants  together  will  be  about  400.  Among  the  vowels  I 
have  noticed  that  the  letter  o,  while  not  less  frequent  than  the  consonants, 
occurs  less  often  than  the  other  vowels.”  He  continued  in  this  vein  through  a 
detailed  description  of  the  characteristics  of  Latin:  “When  the  consonants 
follow  a vowel  at  the  end  of  the  word,  this  final  consonant  will  never  be  any 
except  t,  s,  and  x,  to  which  c may  be  added.”  He  touched  briefly  upon  Italian 
and  pointed  out  that  if  a cipher  message  has  more  than  20  different  elements, 
nulls  and  homophones  may  be  present  because  Latin  and  Italian  use  only 
20  letters. 

Only  after  he  had  explained  how  ciphers  are  solved  did  he  proceed  to  ways 
of  preventing  solution — a wise  procedure  which  is  ordinarily  neglected  by  the 
inventors  of  cipher  systems.  Alberti  first  reviewed  different  systems  of  en- 
cipherment: substitutions  of  various  kinds,  transposition  of  the  letters  within 
a word,  placing  dots  above  the  letters  of  a cover  text  to  spell  out  a secret 
message,  and  invisible  inks.  He  capped  his  work  with  a cipher  of  his  own 
invention  that  he  called  “worthy  of  kings”  and,  like  all  inventors,  claimed  was 
unbreakable.  This  was  the  cipher  disk  that  founded  polyalphabeticity.  With 
this  invention,  the  West,  which  up  to  this  point  had  equaled  but  had  never 
surpassed  the  East  in  cryptology,  took  the  lead  that  it  has  never  lost. 

"I  make  two  circles  out  of  copper  plates.  One,  the  larger,  is  called  station- 
ary, the  smaller  is  called  movable.  The  diameter  of  the  stationary  plate  is  one- 
ninth  greater  than  that  of  the  movable  plate.  I divide  the  circumference  of 
each  circle  into  24  equal  parts.  These  parts  are  called  cells.  In  the  various  cells 
of  the  larger  circle  I write  the  capital  letters,  one  at  a time  in  red,  in  the  usual 
order  of  the  letters,  a first,  B second,  c third,  and  then  the  rest,  omitting  h and 
k [and  y]  because  they  are  not  necessary.”  This  gave  him  20  letters,  since  j, 


128 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


u,  and  w were  not  in  his  alphabet,  and  in  the  remaining  four  spaces  he 
inscribed  the  numbers  1 to  4 in  black.  (The  red  and  black  seem  to  signify  only 
that  Alberti  liked  colors.)  In  each  of  the  24  cells  of  the  movable  circle  he 
inscribed  “a  small  letter  in  black,  and  not  in  regular  order  like  the  stationary 
characters,  but  scattered  at  random.  Thus  we  may  suppose  the  first  of  them  to 
be  a,  the  second  g,  the  third  q,  and  so  on  with  the  rest  until  the  24  cells  of  the 
circle  are  full ; for  there  are  24  characters  in  the  Latin  alphabet,  the  last  being 
et  [probably  meaning  “&”].  After  completing  these  arrangements  we  place  the 
smaller  circle  upon  the  larger  so  that  a needle  driven  through  the  centers  of 
both  may  serve  as  the  axis  of  both  and  the  movable  plate  may  be  revolved 
around  it.” 


Leon  Battista  Alberti's  cipher  disk 


The  two  correspondents — who,  Alberti  carefully  pointed  out,  must  each 
have  identical  disks — agree  upon  an  index  letter  in  the  movable  disk,  say  k. 
Then,  to  encipher,  the  sender  places  this  prearranged  index  letter  against  any 
letter  of  the  outer  disk.  He  informs  his  correspondent  of  this  position  of  the 
disk  by  writing,  as  the  first  letter  of  the  ciphertext,  this  letter  of  the  outer  ring. 
Alberti  gave  the  example  of  k being  placed  against  b.  “From  this  as  a starting 
point  all  the  other  characters  of  the  message  will  acquire  the  force  and  sounds 
of  the  stationary  characters  above  them.”*  So  far  nothing  remarkable  had 
happened.  But  in  his  next  sentence  Alberti  placed  cryptography’s  feet  on  the 
road  to  its  modern  complexity.  “After  writing  three  or  four  words,  I shall 
change  the  position  of  the  index  in  our  formula  by  turning  the  circle,  so  that 
the  index  k may  be,  say,  under  d.  So  in  my  message  I shall  write  a capital  d, 

* In  Alberti’s  disk,  the  outer  capital  letters  are  the  plaintext  and  the  inner  lower-case 
letters  are  the  ciphertext.  This  contradicts  the  convention  of  this  book,  and  is  being  used  in 
the  section  on  Alberti  only  to  avoid  altering  his  text.  The  difference  is  signalized  by  not 
using  italic  for  the  lower  case.

and  from  this  point  on  [ciphertext]  k will  signify  no  longer  b but  d,  and  all 
the  other  stationary  letters  at  the  top  will  receive  new  meanings.” 

There  is  the  crucial  point:  “new  meanings.”  Each  new  position  of  the 
inner  disk  brings  different  letters  opposite  one  another  in  the  inner  and  outer 
rings.  Consequently,  each  shift  means  that  plaintext  letters  would  be  replaced 
with  different  ciphertext  equivalents.  For  example,  the  plaintext  word  no 
might  be  enciphered  to  fc  at  one  setting  and  to  ze  at  another.  Equally,  at  each 
shift  a given  ciphertext  letter  would  stand  for  a different  plaintext  letter  than 
it  did  at  the  previous  setting.  Thus,  the  fc  that  formerly  represented  no  might, 
at  the  new  setting,  stand  for  plaintext  tu.  This  shift  in  both  plain  and  cipher 
equivalents  differentiates  polyalphabetic  from  homophonic  or  polyphonic 
substitution.  In  homophonic  substitution,  plaintext  e might  be  represented  by 
89,  43,  57,  and  64 — but  those  four  numbers  would  always  and  invariably  refer 
to  the  same  plaintext,  whereas  in  polyalphabetic  substitution  cipher  equiva- 
lents have  different  plaintext  meanings.  Moreover,  while  e in  homophonic 
substitution  is  limited  to  that  group  of  cipher  equivalents,  in  polyalphabetic 
substitution  it  may  be  replaced  by  any  one  of  the  ciphertext  letters.  In  substitu- 
tion using  polyphones,  ciphertext  24  may  stand  for  both  plaintext  R and 
plaintext  G.  But  it  will  invariably  stand  for  just  those  two  letters,  whereas  a 
ciphertext  symbol  in  polyalphabetic  substitution  may  stand  for  any  one  of  all 
the  plaintext  letters.  To  a cryptanalyst,  the  quicksilver,  impermanent  nature 
of  cipher  symbols  in  polyalphabetic  substitution,  which  mean  one  thing  here 
and  another  there,  can  be  exceedingly  baffling;  at  the  same  time,  the  collapse 
of  his  expectations  of  seeing  a plaintext  a being  again  represented  by  the 
ciphertext  symbol  that  he  previously  extracted  for  it  can  be  very  frustrating. 

Each  new  setting  of  Alberti’s  disk  brought  into  play  a new  cipher  alphabet, 
in  which  both  the  plaintext  and  the  ciphertext  equivalents  are  changed  in 
regard  to  one  another.  There  are  as  many  of  these  alphabets  as  there  are 
positions  of  his  disk,  and  this  multiplicity  means  that  Alberti  here  devised  the 
first  polyalphabetic  cipher. 

This  achievement — critical  in  the  history  of  cryptology — Alberti  then 
adorned  by  another  remarkable  invention:  enciphered  code.  It  was  for  this 
that  he  had  put  numbers  in  the  outer  ring.  In  a table  he  permuted  the  numbers 
1 to  4 in  two-,  three-,  and  four-digit  groups,  from  1 1 to  4444,  and  used  these 
as  336  codegroups  for  a small  code.  “In  this  table,  according  to  agreement, 
we  shall  enter  in  the  various  lines  at  the  numbers  whatever  complete  phrases 
we  please,  for  example,  corresponding  to  12,  ‘We  have  made  ready  the  ships 
which  we  promised  and  supplied  them  with  troops  and  grain.’  ” These  code 
values  did  not  change,  any  more  than  the  mixed  alphabet  of  the  disk  did.  But 
the  digits  resulting  from  an  encoding  were  then  enciphered  with  the  disk  just 
as  if  they  were  plaintext  letters.  In  Alberti’s  words,  “These  numbers  I then 
insert  in  my  message  according  to  the  formula  of  the  cipher,  representing 
them  by  the  letters  that  denote  these  numbers.”  These  numbers  thus  changed 
their  ciphertext  equivalents  as  the  disk  turned.  Hence  341,  perhaps  meaning

“Pope,”  might  become  mrp  at  one  position  and  fco  at  another.  This  consti- 
tutes an  excellent  form  of  enciphered  code,  and  just  how  precocious  Alberti 
was  may  be  seen  by  the  fact  that  the  major  powers  of  the  earth  did  not  begin 
to  encipher  their  code  messages  until  400  years  later,  near  the  end  of  the  19th 
century,  and  even  then  their  systems  were  much  simpler  than  this. 

Alberti’s  three  remarkable  firsts — the  earliest  Western  exposition  of 
cryptanalysis,  the  invention  of  polyalphabetic  substitution,  and  the  invention 
of  enciphered  code — make  him  the  Father  of  Western  Cryptology.  But 
although  his  treatise  was  published  in  Italian  in  a collection  of  his  works  in 
1568,  and  although  his  ideas  were  absorbed  by  the  Argentis  and  so  influenced 
the  later  development  of  cryptology,  they  never  had  the  dynamic  impact  that 
such  prodigious  accomplishments  ought  to  have  produced.  Symonds’ 
evaluation  of  his  work  in  general  may  both  explain  why  and  summarize  the 
modern  view  of  his  cryptological  contributions:  “This  man  of  many-sided 
genius  came  into  the  world  too  soon  for  the  perfect  exercise  of  his  singular 
faculties.  Whether  we  regard  him  from  the  point  of  view  of  art,  of  science,  or 
of  literature,  he  occupies  in  each  department  the  position  of  precursor, 
pioneer,  and  indicator.  Always  original  and  always  fertile,  he  prophesied  of 
lands  he  was  not  privileged  to  enter,  leaving  the  memory  of  dim  and  varied 
greatness  rather  than  any  solid  monument  behind  him.” 

Polyalphabeticity  took  another  step  forward  in  1518,  with  the  appearance 
of  the  first  printed  book  on  cryptology,  written  by  one  of  the  most  famous 
intellectuals  of  his  day.  He  was  born  February  2,  1462,  in  Trittenheim,  Ger- 
many, where  his  father,  a wealthy  winegrower,  was  known  only  as  Johannes 
of  Heidenberg,  his  former  village.  The  father  died  a year  later,  and  the  son, 
also  named  Johannes,  was  raised  first  by  his  mother  and  then  by  a rather 
stern  stepfather,  who  ridiculed  the  boy’s  passion  for  learning.  At  17,  Johannes 
left  home  and  sought  entry  to  the  University  of  Heidelberg,  where  its  chan- 
cellor, Johannes  of  Dalberg,  was  so  impressed  by  the  youth’s  brilliance  that 
he  granted  him  a pauper’s  certificate  exonerating  the  tuition  fees.  Soon 
thereafter,  Johannes  of  Dalberg,  one  Rodolphe  Huesmann,  and  the  young 
Johannes  formed  the  Rhenish  Literary  Society,  each  taking,  according  to 
custom,  a Latin  and  a Greek  name.  The  young  man  chose  “Trithemius,” 
which,  while  having  a certain  consonance  with  the  name  of  his  native  village 
of  Trittenheim,  indicated  that  he  was  the  third  link  of  the  group.  He  has  been 
known  as  Johannes  Trithemius  ever  since. 

In  January,  1482,  when  the  young  Trithemius  was  on  his  way  home  from 
Heidelberg  for  a New  Year’s  visit,  he  sought  shelter  during  a heavy  snowstorm 
at  the  impoverished,  437-year-old  Benedictine  abbey  of  Saint  Martin  at 
Spanheim,  Germany.  He  was  very  much  attracted  by  the  life  of  the  monks 
and  soon  entered  the  novitiate.  A year  and  a half  later,  only  a little  while  after 
taking  his  final  vows,  he  was  elected  abbot — either  because  the  monks  re- 
cognized his  brilliance  or  because  they  thought  that  he  would  be  too  young  to

On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

enforce  discipline.  He  maintained  his  post,  however,  and  at  24  published  a 
book  of  sermons  that  gave  him  an  instant  fame.  He  was  called  upon  to  preach 
before  princes  and  religious  conventions.  His  reputation  as  a savant  grew 
with  his  prolific  writings — several  histories,  a biographical  dictionary  of 
famous  Germans,  one  of  famous  Benedictines,  a chronicle  of  the  dukes  of 
Bavaria  and  the  Counts  Palatine,  a life  of  Saint  Maximum  and  one  of  an 
archbishop  of  Mainz.  Learned  men  corresponded  with  him.  He  knew  the 
original  Dr.  Faustus  well  enough  to  consider  him  a charlatan.  Powerful  rulers 
like  the  Margrave  of  Brandenberg  and  the  Holy  Roman  Emperor  Maximilian 
I invited  him  to  their  castles.  And  posterity  has  honored  him.  His  most 
important  work,  the  Liber  de  scriptoribus  ecclesiasticis,  a chronological  list  of 
about  7,000  theological  works  by  963  authors  that  was  published  in  1494, 
earned  him  the  title  of  Father  of  Bibliography.  It  was  conferred  by  Theodore 
Besterman,  compiler  of  the  World  Bibliography  of  Bibliographies,  who  said 
that  Trithemius  “was  not  the  first  to  compile  bibliographies,  but  he  was 
certainly  the  first  bibliographically-minded  scholar  to  do  so.” 

These  were  all  solid  works.  But  Trithemius’  other  writings  were  darkened 
by  his  intense  interest,  not  to  say  belief,  in  occult  powers.  (Like  others  of  his 
day,  he  could  reconcile  this  with  his  pious  Christianity  because  the  leading 
treatises  on  esoterism,  thought  to  have  been  written  by  an  Egyptian  priest 
called  Hermes  Trismesgistus,  had  actually  been  compiled  by  Christians  in  the 
second  century  a.d.  and  so  contained  nothing  monumentally  offensive  to  the 
church.)  Trithemius  wrote  on  alchemy,  classified  witches  into  four  carefully 
defined  categories,  explained  the  twelve  angelic  hierarchies  ruled  by  emperors 
related  to  the  chief  winds  and  points  of  the  compass.  He  analyzed  history  in 
terms  of  the  354-year  cycles  of  the  seven  planetary  angels,  bearing  names  like 
Orifiel  and  Zachariel,  and  fixed  the  creation  of  the  world  at  5206  b.c.  These 
writings  made  him  one  of  the  great  figures  of  occult  science,  and  today  books 
on  the  subject  venerate  him  as  a superlative  alchemist  and  as  the  mentor  of 
two  other  almost  legendary  occultists,  Paracelsus  and  Cornelius  Agrippa. 

In  1499,  Trithemius,  who  after  long  pondering  had  finally  concluded  that 
some  things  were  unknowable,  was  said  to  have  been  visited  in  a dream  by  a 
spirit  who  taught  him  many  of  these  very  things.  These  he  wrote  down  in  a 
volume  which  he  intended  to  comprise  eight  books  and  which  he  called 
“Steganographia,”  from  Greek  words  meaning  “covered  writing.”  In  the 
first  two  books  he  described  some  elementary  reciprocal  vowel-consonant 
substitutions  and  several  variations  on  a system  in  which  only  certain  letters 
of  nonsense  words  signify  the  meaning,  the  other  letters  being  nulls.  For 
example,  in  the  message  beginning  parmesiel  oshurmi  delmuson  thafloin 
peano  CHARUSTREA  melany  lyamunto  . . . , the  decipherer  extracts  every 
other  letter  of  every  other  word,  beginning  with  the  second  word  since  the 
first  indicates  the  specific  system.  The  Latin  plaintext  begins  Sum  tali  cautela 
tit  ...  . But  all  this  may  have  simply  served  as  a cover  for  the  magical  opera- 
tions described  in  the  third  book,  which  included  no  cryptography  at  all.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Here  Trithemius  slipped  again  into  the  shadow  world  of  spirits  with  names 
like  Vathmiel,  Choriel,  and  Sameron,  and  discussed  methods  that  sound  like 
telepathy.  To  convey  a message  to  a desired  recipient  within  24  hours,  for 
example,  one  needed  simply  to  say  it  over  an  image  of  a planetary  angel  at  a 
moment  determined  by  complicated  astrological  calculations,  wrap  the 
image  up  with  an  image  of  the  recipient,  bury  them  under  a threshold,  say  the 
proper  incantations  ending  with  “In  nomine  patris  & filii  & spiritus  sancti, 
Amen,’  and  the  message  would  arrive,  Trithemius  assured  the  reader,  without 
words,  writing,  or  messenger.  Trithemius  told  how  to  use  the  network  of 
angels  for  thought  transference  and  for  gaining  knowledge  of  all  things 
happening  in  the  world.  Involved  is  the  Kabbalah-like  computation  of  the 
numerical  values  of  the  angels’  names;  Trithemius,  like  other  hermeticists, 
regarded  Moses  as  a kind  of  Jewish  Hermes  Trismesgistus. 

He  showed  the  “Steganographia”  in  its  incompleted  state  to  a visitor,  who 
was  so  horrified  at  its  barbarous  names  of  seraphim,  its  obscurantism,  its 
impossible  claims,  that  he  denounced  it  as  sorcery.  A letter  which  Trithemius 
wrote  to  a friend  arrived  after  the  friend  had  died;  the  prior  of  the  abbey 
opened  it,  was  likewise  shocked,  and  passed  it  around.  Trithemius  fell  under 
a cloud  of  working  in  magic,  which  the  church  even  then  frowned  upon.  He 
abandoned  the  book,  but  probably  did  not  mind  the  reputation  he  was  gain- 
ing as  a wonder-worker,  for  Trithemius  was  more  than  a bit  of  the  braggart 
and  publicity  hound.  He  had  concluded  his  ecclesiastical  bibliography  with 
some  of  his  own  books— inserted,  he  said,  “at  the  solicitation  of  my  friends.” 
To  a visitor,  he  boasted  that  he  had  taught  an  illiterate  German  prince  Latin 
in  an  hour,  and  then,  before  the  prince  departed,  withdrew  all  his  knowledge. 
He  offered  to  make  a thief  return  everything  that  he  had  stolen  from  the 
visitor  if  only  the  visitor  would  have  faith;  of  course  he  did  not  have  enough. 
Trithemius  maintained  that  he  comprehended  nothing  less  than  wisdom  itself. 
This  sort  of  thing  naturally  attracted  crowds  of  the  curious  and  hopeful  and 
started  the  wild  rumors  about  his  magic  powers  that  were  circulating  even 
during  his  life.  According  to  one,  the  abbot,  finding  himself  at  an  inn  where 
supplies  had  run  short,  tapped  on  a window  and  called  out  in  Latin,  where- 
upon a spirit  passed  in  to  him  a broiled  pike  and  a bottle  of  wine. 

Believing  sincerely  that  his  own  practices  were  devoutly  Christian,  Trithe- 
mius did  not  fight  the  legend,  except  to  deny  that  there  was  anything  demonic 
or  un-Christian  in  his  practices.  His  reputation  for  esoteric  knowledge  grew 
so  great,  in  fact,  that  the  “Steganographia”  circulated  in  manuscript  for  a 
hundred  years,  being  copied  by  many  persons  eager  to  suck  out  the  secrets 
that  it  was  thought  to  hold.  Parts  were  transcribed  for  Giordano  Bruno, 
among  others.  It  became  famous,  and  controversy  flamed  about  it.  In  1599, 
for  example,  the  Jesuit  Martin  Antoine  Del  Rio  called  it  “full  of  peril  and 
superstition.”  Not  until  1606  was  it  printed,  and  this  exacerbated  the  dispute. 
The  opponents  scored  a great  victory  when,  on  September  7,  1609,  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church  placed  it  on  its  Index  of  Prohibited  Books.  It  stayed  there 


133 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

for  more  than  200  years,  throughout  numerous  reprintings,  the  last  as  late  as 
1721.  Many  scholars  attacked  it,  and  others  wrote  whole  books  defending  it. 
But  the  larger  controversy  over  magic  faded  as  the  Age  of  Reason  gained 
sway,  and  the  book  lost  its  interest. 

Even  during  Trithemius’  lifetime,  however,  it  had  caused  him  trouble.  In 
1506,  while  he  was  away  on  a trip,  the  monks  at  Spanheim  mutinied,  appar- 
ently because  his  reputation  as  a magician,  due  in  no  small  measure  to  the 
“Steganographia.”  had  brought  odium  to  the  monastery.  He  never  returned, 
but  obtained  a transfer  to  the  monastery  of  Saint  Jacob  in  Wurzburg,  where, 
on  October  3,  1506,  he  was  elected  prior.  Early  in  1508,  he  addressed  himself 
to  a book  carefully  restricted  to  cryptology,  as  if  to  prove  that  that  was  what 
he  meant  all  along.  He  called  it  the  “Polygraphia”  because  of  the  multiplicity 
of  ways  of  writing  that  it  included.  He  perhaps  began  it  on  his  46th  birthday, 
for  he  finished  Book  I on  February  12,  and  he  wrote  each  of  its  six  books  in 
an  average  of  ten  days.  At  that  rate,  he  completed  it  quickly,  probably  by 
April  24,  the  date  of  its  dedication  to  the  Holy  Roman  Emperor  Maximilian  I. 
Like  others  of  his  writings,  it  was  not  published  at  once,  and  Trithemius 
turned  to  the  composition  of  other  texts.  So  he  lived  on  quietly  at  Wurzburg, 
where  he  studied,  wrote,  corresponded,  and  received  visitors,  and  where,  on 
December  15,  1516,  he  died. 

A year  and  a half  later,  the  descendants  of  his  old  preceptor,  Johannes  of 
Dalberg,  paid  for  the  publication  of  the  “Polygraphia,”  which  thereby  became 
the  first  printed  book  on  cryptology.  It  bore  the  title  Polygraphiae  libri  sex, 
Ioannis  Trithemii  abbatis  Peapolitani,  quondam  Spanheimensis,  ad  Maxi- 
milianum  Caesarem  (“Six  Books  of  Polygraphy,  by  Johannes  Trithemius, 
Abbot  at  Wurzburg,  formerly  at  Spanheim,  for  the  Emperor  Maximilian”). 
Johannes  Haselberg  of  Aia  completed  its  printing  in  July,  1518.  It  is  a hand- 
some small  folio  of  540  pages  in  red  and  black,  with  a woodcut  title  page 
borrowed  from  an  earlier  book  by  Trithemius.  It  ends  with  a “Clavis  Poly- 
graphiae” which  repeats  the  original  woodcut  title  page  and  gives  a resume 
of  the  preceding  six  books.  It  was  reprinted  in  1550,  1571,  1600,  and  1613, 
and  a French  translation  (heavily  edited  and  modified)  by  Gabriel  de  Col- 
langes  appeared  in  1561  and  was  reprinted  in  1625.  This  became  the  subject 
of  one  of  the  world’s  most  notorious  plagiarisms  when  in  1620  a Frisian 
named  Dominique  de  Hottinga  published  Collange’s  work  as  his  own  and 
even  complained  of  how  hard  it  was  to  do! 

By  far  the  bulk  of  the  volume  consists  of  the  columns  of  words  printed  in 
large  Gothic  type  that  Trithemius  used  in  his  systems  of  cryptography.  The 
first  of  the  six  books  comprises  384  columns  of  Latin  words,  two  columns  per 
page,  for  Trithemius’  best-known  invention,  his  Ave  Maria.  Each  word 
represents  the  plaintext  letter  that  stands  opposite  it.  Trithemius  so  selected 
the  words  that,  as  the  equivalents  for  the  letters  are  taken  from  consecutive 
tables,  they  will  make  connected  sense  and  will  appear  to  be  an  innocent 
prayer.  Thus  abbot  would  be  enciphered  as  deus  clementissimus  regens 


The  woodcut  title  page  of  the  first  printed  book  on  cryptology.  Though  taken  from 
an  earlier  book  by  the  same  author,  Johannes  Trithemius,  the  illustration  was  apparently 
appropriate  to  this  book  as  well.  It  shows  the  author  wearing  his  Benedictine  habit  and, 
with  his  abbot's  miter  on  the  floor  before  him,  kneeling  to  present  his  book — pad- 
locked, as  befits  its  secret  character — to  the  dedicatee,  the  Holy  Roman  Emperor 
Maximilian  I.  Seated  upon  his  throne  in  the  imperial  castle  at  Augsburg  and  wearing 
the  imperial  crown  and  mantle,  Maximilian  holds  his  scepter  in  one  hand  and  blesses 
Trithemius  with  the  other.  Behind  Trithemius,  another  person — either  another  monk 
or  the  publisher — extends  towards  Maximilian  two  keys  to  the  book,  these  symboliz-

aevum  infinivet.  Book  II  lists  284  similar  alphabets.  Book  III  has  1,056 
numbered  lines  of  three  artificial  words  per  line,  arranged  in  columns.  A 
typical  column  begins  huba,  hube,  hubi,  hubo,  and  so  on  down  to  the  24th 
word,  hubon.  These  were  to  be  used  like  those  of  the  Ave  Maria — but  just 
how  this  was  to  avoid  suspicion  is  hard  to  see.  Book  IV  lists  1 1 7 columns  of 
artificial  words  whose  second  letter  varied  in  each  column  from  a to  w (the 
last  letter  of  the  alphabet  Trithemius  used,  following  z):  baldach,  abzach, 
ecozach,  adonach,  . . . These  served  to  construct  a cover  text  in  which  only

The  first  page  of  Johannes  Trithemius ’ “Ave  Maria ” cipher 


the  second  letters  of  each  word  would  carry  the  secret  message.  Taking  words 
from  his  first  three  alphabets  in  order,  bad  would  become  abzach  hanasar 
adamai.  Once  again,  this  does  not  appear  the  height  of  innocence.  Perhaps 
Trithemius  just  could  not  stay  away  from  those  incantatory  words.  Book  VI 
gives  supposed  cipher  alphabets  of  the  Franks  and  Normans,  as  well  as  the 
first  printed  description  of  Tironian  notes. 

It  is  Book  V that  contains  Trithemius’  contributions  to  polyalphabeticity. 
Here  appears,  for  the  first  time  in  cryptology,  the  square  table,  or  tableau. 
This  is  the  elemental  form  of  polyalphabetic  substitution,  for  it  exhibits  all  at 
once  all  the  cipher  alphabets  in  a particular  system.  These  are  usually  all  the 
same  sequence  of  letters,  but  shifted  to  different  positions  in  relation  to  the 


ing  Maximilian's  spiritual  authority  and  temporal  power.  In  the  background 
Trithemius'  chaplain,  a young  monk , holds  his  abbot's  crozier.  At  bottom,  Trithemius 
reclines  with  a fruit-laden  branch  representing  the  motto  “ Ye  shall  judge  the  tree  by 
its  fruits ” and  implying  that  Trithemius ' many  works  make  him  worthy  of  acclaim.

plaintext  alphabet,  as  in  Alberti’s  disk  the  inner  alphabet  assumed  different 
positions  in  regard  to  the  outer  alphabet.  The  tableau  sets  them  out  in 
orderly  fashion — the  alphabets  of  the  successive  positions  laid  out  in  rows  one 
below  the  other,  each  alphabet  shifted  one  place  to  the  left  of  the  one  above. 
Each  row  thus  offers  a different  set  of  cipher  substitutes  to  the  letters  of  the 
plaintext  alphabet  at  the  top.  Since  there  can  be  only  as  many  rows  as  there 
are  letters  in  the  alphabet,  the  tableau  is  square. 

The  simplest  tableau  is  one  that  uses  the  normal  alphabet  in  various 
positions  as  the  cipher  alphabets.  Each  cipher  alphabet  produces,  in  other 
words,  a Caesar  substitution.  This  is  precisely  Trithemius’  tableau,  which  he 
called  his  “tabula  recta.”  Its  first  and  last  few  lines  were: 

abcdefghi  kl  mnopqrstuxyzw 
bcdef  ghi  kl  mnopqrs  t uxyzwa 
cdefghi  kl  mnopqrs  tuxyzwab 
def  ghi  kl  mnopqrs  t uxyzwabc 
efghi  kl  mnopqrstuxyzwabcd 

zwabcdef  ghi  kl  mnopqrs  t uxy 
wabcdefghi  kl  mnopqrst  uxyz 

Trithemius  used  this  tableau  for  his  polyalphabetic  encipherment,  and  in  the 
simplest  manner  possible.  He  enciphered  the  first  letter  with  the  first  alphabet, 
the  second  with  the  second,  and  so  on.  (He  gave  no  separate  plaintext  alpha- 
bet, but  the  normal  alphabet  at  the  top  can  serve.)  Thus  a plaintext  beginning 
Hunc  caveto  virum  . . . became  hxpf  gfbmcz  fueib.  ...  In  this  particular 
message,  he  switched  to  another  alphabet  after  24  letters,  but  in  another 
example  he  followed  the  more  normal  procedure  of  repeating  the  alphabets 
over  and  over  again  in  groups  of  24. 

The  great  advantage  of  this  procedure  over  Alberti’s  is  that  a new  alphabet 
is  brought  into  play  with  each  letter.  Alberti  shifted  alphabets  only  after  three 
or  four  words.  Thus  the  ciphertext  would  mirror  the  obvious  pattern  of 
repeated  letters  of  a word  like  Papa  (“Pope”),  or  in  English,  attack,  and  the 
cryptanalyst  could  seize  upon  this  reflection  to  break  into  the  cryptogram. 
The  letter-by-letter  encipherment  obliterates  this  clue. 

Trithemius’  system  is  also  the  first  instance  of  a progressive  key,  in  which 
all  the  available  cipher  alphabets  are  exhausted  before  any  are  repeated. 
Modern  cipher  machines  very  often  embody  such  key  progressions.  Naturally, 
they  avoid  the  chief  defects  of  Trithemius’  primitive  system:  its  paucity  of 
alphabets  and  the  rigid  order  of  their  use. 

Trithemius’  influence  in  cryptology  was  very  great,  owing  in  part  to  his 
reputation  and  in  part  to  his  having  authored  the  first  printed  book  on  the 
subject.  Letter-by-letter  encipherment  quickly  became  customary  in  poly- 
alphabetic theorizing,  and  the  tableau  established  itself  as  a standard  item  in 
cryptology.  It  formed  the  basis  of  innumerable  ciphers,  and  so  important  did 
it  become  that  some  German  authors  attempted  to  enshrine  their  compatriot 


137 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

as  the  Father  of  Cryptology  on  this  basis  alone.  But  valuable  as  his  contribu- 
tions were,  they  do  not  justify  that  accolade. 

If  the  first  two  steps  in  polyalphabeticity  were  made  by  men  who  were 
giants  in  their  time,  the  third  was  taken  by  a man  who  was  so  unexceptional 
that  he  left  almost  no  traces.  This  is  Giovan  Batista  Belaso;  the  sum  total  of 
knowledge  about  him  consists  of  the  facts  that  he  came  from  Brescia  of  a noble 
family,  served  in  the  suite  of  one  Cardinal  Carpi,  and,  in  1553,  brought  out  a 
little  booklet  entitled  La  cifra  del.  Sig.  Giovan  Batista  Belaso.  In  this  he 
proposed  the  use  of  a literal,  easily  remembered,  and  easily  changed  key — he 
called  it  a “countersign” — for  a polyalphabetic  cipher.  Wrote  Belaso:  “This 
countersign  may  consist  of  some  words  in  Italian  or  Latin  or  any  other 
language,  and  the  words  may  be  few  or  many  as  desired.  Then  we  take  the 
words  we  wish  to  write,  and  put  them  on  paper,  writing  them  not  too  close 
together.  Then  over  each  of  the  letters  we  place  a letter  of  our  countersign  in 
this  form.  Suppose,  for  example,  our  countersign  is  the  little  versetto  VIR- 
TUTI  OMNIA  PARENT.  And  suppose  we  wish  to  write  these  words: 
Larmata  Turchesca  partira  a cinque  di  Luglio.  We  shall  put  them  on  paper  in 
this  manner: 

VIRTUTI  OMNIA  PARENT  VIRTUTI  OMNIA  PARENT  VI 
larmata  t urch  escapa  rtiraac  i nque  di  1 u g 1 io” 

The  keyletter  that  is  paired  with  a given  plaintext  letter  indicates  the  alphabet 
of  the  tableau  that  is  to  be  used  to  encipher  that  plaintext  letter.  Thus,  / is 
to  be  enciphered  by  the  V alphabet,  a by  the  I alphabet,  and  so  on.  The  system 
permits  great  flexibility:  no  longer  did  all  messages  have  to  be  enciphered  with 
one  of  a relatively  few  standard  sequences  of  alphabets,  but  different  ambas- 
sadors could  be  given  individual  keys,  and,  if  it  were  feared  that  a key  had 
been  stolen  or  solved,  a new  one  could  be  substituted  with  the  greatest  of  ease. 
Keys  caught  on  at  once,  and  the  Belaso  invention  laid  the  foundation  for 
today’s  exceedingly  complex  arrangements,  in  which  not  one  but  several 
keys  are  employed  and  are  varied  at  odd  intervals. 

Belaso,  however,  like  Trithemius,  employed  standard  alphabets  as  his 
cipher  alphabets.  It  remained  for  a young  prodigy,  who  later  organized  the 
first  scientific  society  of  modern  times,  to  revive  the  mixed  alphabets  of 
Alberti  and  to  wrap  Alberti’s  notions  together  with  those  of  Trithemius  and 
Belaso  into  the  modern  concept  of  polyalphabetic  substitution. 

Giovanni  Battista  Porta  was  born  in  Naples  in  1535,  was  raised  by  a 
cultured  and  intelligent  uncle,  and  was  composing  essays  in  Latin  and  Italian 
by  the  time  he  was  ten.  After  the  usual  grand  tour,  he  returned  to  Naples  and, 
at  22,  published  his  first  book,  a study  of  oddities  and  scientific  curiosa 
entitled  Magia  naturalis.  Later,  he  brought  together  in  his  home  in  Naples  a 
group  of  men  similarly  interested  in  natural  magic — the  study  of  the  mysteries 


138 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

of  nature  by  experimental  means,  as  opposed  to  spirit  magic  like  Trithemius’. 
Here  they  met  periodically  and  performed  experiments.  This  was  the  Acca- 
demia  Secretorum  Naturae,  whose  members  called  themselves  the  Otiosi 
(Men  of  Leisure).  It  was  the  first  of  all  associations  of  scientists,  and  as  such 
it  began  the  transformation  of  scientific  inquiry  from  an  individual  eccentricity 
to  the  organized  and  socially  sanctioned  pursuit  that  it  now  is.  The  Otiosi 
were  soon  suspected  of  dabbling  in  the  occult,  however,  and  Porta  was  called 
to  Rome  to  explain  reports  of  witches’  salves  and  necromantic  arts.  He 
cleared  himself  before  Pope  Paul  V,  returning  cautioned  but  unblemished. 
In  fact,  his  “magic”  was  only  that  of  a parlor  conjuror — tricks  cloaked  in 
mystery  but  easily  explained.  He  also  served  as  vice  president  of  another  early 
scientific  society,  the  Accademia  dei  Lincei  (Academy  of  Lynxes),  one  of 
whose  members  was  Galileo. 

Between  1586  and  1609,  Porta  produced  books  on  the  asserted  relation  of 
human  physiognomy  to  animal  characteristics,  which  influenced  the  Italian 
criminologist  Cesare  Lombroso  in  defining  “the  criminal  type,”  on  meteoro- 
logy, the  refraction  of  light,  pneumatics,  the  design  of  villas,  astronomy, 
astrology,  distillation,  and  the  improvement  of  memory,  as  well  as  14  prose 
comedies,  two  tragedies,  and  one  tragicomedy.  An  expanded  version  of  the 
Magia  naturalis,  in  20  books,  recorded  many  of  the  experiments  of  the  Otiosi 
and,  as  popular  as  the  original,  was  translated  and  was  reprinted  no  fewer  than 
27  times.  Called  the  “most  delightful  and  browsable  of  scientific  books,”  it 
includes  such  oddities  as  ways  of  making  merry  by  turning  women’s  faces  red, 
green,  or  pimply,  and  by  using  a juggler’s  prank  of  burning  hare’s  fat  to  cause 
women  to  cast  off  all  their  clothes.  (Not  all  of  Porta’s  tricks  worked.)  Book 
XVI  gave  numerous  recipes  for  secret  ink  and  for  such  tricks  as  writing 
invisibly  on  an  egg  and  on  human  skin  so  that  “messengers  may  be  sent,  who 
shall  neither  know  that  they  carry  letters  nor  can  they  be  found  about  them,” 
and  hiding  missives  in  living  creatures  (by  feeding  a letter  in  meat  to  a dog, 
then  killing  him  to  retrieve  it).  Porta  sometimes  embroidered  the  truth  a little 
in  reporting  the  facts  both  of  his  experiments  and  of  his  life.  But  he  was  the 
first  to  recognize  the  heating  effect  of  light  rays  and  to  expound  an  ecological 
grouping  of  plants.  He  died  in  1615  at  80,  leaving  the  memory  of  a mild- 
tempered  and  pleasant  man. 

Porta  was  only  28  when,  in  1563,  he  published  the  book  on  which  his  fame 
as  a cryptologist  rests.  De  Furtivis  Literarum  Notis  is  an  extraordinary  book. 

Even  today,  four  centuries  later,  it  retains  its  freshness  and  charm  and 

remarkably— its  ability  to  instruct.  Its  great  quality  is  its  perspective:  Porta 
saw  cryptology  in  the  round.  Its  four  books,  dealing  respectively  with  ancient 
ciphers,  modern  ciphers,  cryptanalysis,  and  a list  of  linguistic  peculiarities  that 
will  help  in  solution,  encompassed  the  cryptologic  knowledge  of  the  time.  He 
rehearsed  the  standard  ciphers  of  his  forefathers,  but  he  did  not  hesitate  to 
criticize:  the  venerable  pig-pen,  or  Freemasons’,  or  Rosicrucians’  cipher,  is 
used,  he  sneered,  by  “rustics,  women  and  children.”  Among  the  “modern” 


139 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

systems — many  of  which  are  probably  Porta’s  own — appeared  the  first 
digraphic  cipher  in  cryptology,  in  which  two  letters  were  represented  by  a 
single  symbol. 

He  classified  systems  into  three  kinds:  the  changing  of  a letter’s  order 
(transposition),  of  a letter’s  form  (substitution  by  symbol),  and  of  a letter’s 
value  (substitution  by  a letter  of  another  alphabet).  This  was  one  of  the  earliest, 
if  crude,  instances  of  the  now  standard  division  of  ciphers  into  transposition

The  earliest  known  digraphic  system:  Giovanni  Battista  Porta  replaced  each  pair 
of  letters  with  the  sign  at  the  intersection  of  their  row  and  columns 

and  substitution.  He  urged  the  use  of  synonyms  in  plaintexts,  noting  that  “It 
will  also  make  for  difficulty  of  interpretation  if  we  avoid  the  repetition  of  the 
same  word.”  Like  the  Argentis,  he  suggested  deliberate  misspellings  of  plain- 
text words:  “For  it  is  better  for  a scribe  to  be  thought  ignorant  than  to  pay  the 
penalty  for  the  detection  of  plans,”  he  wrote.  The  book  included  a set  of 
movable  rococo  cipher  disks,  and  at  one  point  Porta  explained  how  they  may 
be  converted  to  a square  table.  His  grasping  of  this  relationship  illuminates 
more  clearly  than  anything  else  his  thorough  comprehension  of  the  subject. 


140 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


He  spiced  his  book  with  some  eyebrow-raising  sample  plaintexts.  Perhaps  the 
most  startling  is  “I  deflowered  the  object  of  my  affections  today,”  used  for  six 
encipherments  in  a row.  He  gave  the  first  published  description  in  Europe  of 
how  to  solve  a monalphabetic  cipher  with  no  word  divisions  or  with  false 
word  divisions,  at  a time  when  cryptanalysts  often  depended  on  the  presence 
of  word  divisions. 

Porta  anticipated  all  other  writers  on  the  subject  by  describing  what  is 
regarded  today  as  the  second  major  form  of  cryptanalytical  technique — that 
of  the  probable  word — and,  furthermore,  by  specifically  differentiating  it  from 
linguistic  analysis:  . . when  the  subject  matter  is  known,”  he  wrote,  “the 
interpreter  can  make  a shrewd  guess  at  the  common  words  that  concern  the 
matter  in  hand,  and  these  can  without  much  labor  be  discovered  by  observing 
for  each  word  in  the  passages  in  question  the  number  of  characters  and  the 
likeness  and  difference  of  the  letters  in  their  positions.  ...  In  each  subject 
there  are  several  common  words  which  go  with  it  as  it  were  of  necessity;  for 
example,  in  love,  love,  heart,  fire,  fiame,  to  be  burned,  life,  death,  pity,  and 
cruelty  have  place,  and  in  war,  soldier,  leader,  general,  camp,  arms , to  fight, 
etc.  . . . Thus,  a form  of  interpretation  which  is  not  based  on  consideration  of 
the  documents  themselves  or  on  the  attempt  to  distinguish  vowels  and  con- 
sonants therein  may  lighten  the  task.” 

He  proffered  some  sapient  advice  on  work  techniques,  as  valid  today  as  it 
was  in  Renaissance  Italy: 

There  is  required  the  most  complete  concentration,  the  most  perfect  diligence, 
so  that  the  mind,  free  from  all  distracting  thoughts,  and  with  everything  else  put 
aside,  may  devote  itself  entirely  to  the  single  task  of  carrying  the  whole  under- 
taking to  a successful  conclusion.  Still,  if  the  task  sometimes  requires  unusual 
concentration  and  expenditure  of  time,  this  concentration  should  not  go  on 
uninterrupted;  the  brain  should  not  be  racked  over-anxiously.  For  excessive 
pains  and  prolonged  mental  effort  bring  on  brain-fag,  so  that  the  mind  is  after- 
wards less  fit  for  these  things,  and  accomplishes  nothing.  . . . This  has  often 
been  my  experience  at  such  times  as  I came  upon  particularly  involved  ciphers, 
in  the  working-out  of  these.  For  after  spending  the  whole  day  in  this  task 
(scarcely  seven  or  eight  hours  seemed  to  me  to  have  gone  by),  I hardly  thought  it 
was  more  than  one  or  two  o’clock,  so  that  I was  not  aware  of  the  approach  of 
evening  except  through  the  shadows  and  the  failing  of  the  light. 

Finally,  Porta  unconsciously  revealed  some  practical  experience  in  one 
sentence:  “It  will  be  found  of  no  small  importance  besides  for  the  message  to 
have  been  written  by  the  hand  of  the  author,  or  a skilled  scribe,  for  if,  after  it 
has  been  intercepted,  it  be  copied  wrong,  or  if  it  have  started  off  from  the 
hands  of  someone  who  was  ignorant  of  the  art  of  cipher,  it  will  readily  result 
that,  since  the  writing  is  confused,  every  way  of  interpreting  it  will  be  blocked.” 
Knowledge  like  that  comes  only  from  wrestling  with  the  dropped  or  trans- 
posed or  altered  letters  that  appear  so  regularly  in  the  transmission  of  real 
cryptograms,  since  the  problems  one  finds  in  books  are  invariably  letter- 


One  of  Giovanni  Battista  Porta's  cipher  disks 


perfect  and  highly  susceptible  to  solution.  It  may  be  that  he  did  some  crypt- 
analysis for  the  papal  curia. 

But  what  of  Porta’s  contribution  to  polyalphabeticity?  It  consists  essen- 
tially of  a lamination  of  existing  elements — the  letter-by-letter  encipherment 
of  Trithemius,  the  easily  changed  key  of  Belaso,  and  the  mixed  alphabet  of 
Alberti — into  a modern  system  of  polyalphabetic  substitution.  Unfortunately 
for  Porta,  though  he  specifically  stated  that  “The  order  [of  the  letters  in  the 
tableau]  . . . may  be  arranged  arbitrarily,  provided  no  letter  is  omitted,”  he 


142 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


illustrated  the  system  only  with  standard  alphabets,  and  a lazy  posterity, 
while  naming  this  trivial  system  for  him,  cheated  him  of  full  recognition  of  his 
contribution.  He  wisely  used  a long  key — CASTUM  FODERAT  LUCRETIA 
PECTUS  ALGAZEL — and  advised  the  choice  of  “irrelevant  words”  for  keys, 
because  “The  further  removed  they  are  from  common  knowledge,  the  greater 
safety  do  they  afford  to  the  writing.”  No  great  originality  may  be  claimed 
for  Porta’s  contribution  to  polyalphabeticity,  but  it  remains  the  first  time  that 
the  modern  concept  of  polyalphabeticity  was  enunciated. 

Perhaps  the  full  measure  of  Porta’s  remarkable  abilities  may  best  be 
taken  by  his  brash  tackling  of  the  toughest  problem  of  Renaissance  cryptology 
— the  solution  of  polyalphabetic  ciphers.  Despite  the  high  esteem  in  which 
these  ciphers  were  then  universally  held,  Porta  refused  to  admit  their  in- 
vincibility and  thought  out  some  methods  of  attack.  These  are  rather  arti- 
ficial, but  their  importance  lies  not  in  their  intrinsic  value,  which  is  low,  but  in 
the  bold  attitude  that  engendered  them — the  only  attitude  that  leads  to  any 
success  in  cryptanalysis. 

In  his  first  solution,  Porta  mounted  an  assault  on  a progressive-alphabet 
cipher  with  mixed  alphabets.  It  was  produced  by  a cipher  disk  with  a normal 
plaintext  alphabet  clockwise  on  the  fixed  portion  and  a series  of  fantastic 
cipher  signs  on  the  mobile  portion,  which  turned  one  space  clockwise  after 
the  encipherment  of  each  letter.  Porta  observed  that  if  three  letters  appear  in 
alphabetical  sequence  in  a plaintext  word  (as  def  in  deficio  or  stu  in  studium) 
the  one-space  progression  of  the  disk  would  bring  the  same  cipher  sign 
successively  opposite  each  of  them,  resulting  in  a threefold  repetition  of  that 
sign  in  the  ciphertext.  Using  this  as  a basis,  Porta  solved  a contrived  crypto- 
gram and  reconstructed  the  symbol  alphabet.  In  his  second  solution,  given  in 
a chapter  added  in  the  1602  edition  of  De  Furtivis,  Porta  modified  his  first 
method  to  solve  another  trick  polyalphabetic  cryptogram  that  had  standard 
alphabets  but  that  used  a literal  key.  Here,  a threefold  repetition  of  a cipher- 
text  letter  signaled  that  a key  with  three  letters  in  normal  alphabetical  order 
had  enciphered  a plaintext  that  had  three  letters  in  reverse  alphabetical  order. 
During  his  discussion,  he  came  within  a hair’s  breadth  of  achieving  the  true 
general  solution  he  sought:  “Since  there  are  ...  51  letters  between  the  first 
three  mmm  and  the  same  three  letters  repeated  in  the  thirteenth  word,  I 
conclude  that  the  key  has  been  given  three  times  and  decide  correctly  that  it 
consists  of  17  letters.”  He  never  capitalized  on  this  observation.  Had  he  done 
so,  he  would  have  kept  the  polyalphabetic  cipher  from  ever  gaining  the 
exaggerated  reputation  for  security  that  glowed  like  a protective  aura  around 
it  for  300  years. 

De  Furtivis , like  Porta's  other  books,  went  through  several  editions  and. 
in  1591,  it  received  the  ultimate  accolade:  it  was  pirated  by  an  unscrupulous 
printer  of  London,  John  Wolfe,  who  counterfeited  the  original  1563  edition 
almost  to  perfection.  A legitimate  1593  edition,  published  under  the  title  of 
De  Occultis  Literarum  Nods,  included  at  the  rear  cryptology’s  first  set  of 


143 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

synoptic  tables.  These  showed  in  graphic  form  the  path  the  cryptanalyst  must 
follow  in  his  analysis  of  a given  cryptogram,  with  the  forks  he  must  take  if  the 
message  shows  one  characteristic  as  opposed  to  another.  Porta’s  overall  rank 
in  the  cryptology  of  his  day  was  well  stated  by  Dr.  Charles  J.  Mendelsohn,  who 
has  delved  more  deeply  into  this  period  than  any  other  scholar:  “He  was,  in 
my  opinion,  the  outstanding  cryptographer  of  the  Renaissance.  Some  un- 
known who  worked  in  a hidden  room  behind  closed  doors  may  possibly  have 
surpassed  him  in  general  grasp  of  the  subject,  but  among  those  whose  work 
can  be  studied  he  towers  like  a giant.” 

Though  Porta  had  molded  together  the  three  basic  elements  that  are 
essential  to  a modern  concept  of  polyalphabeticity,  refinements  were  always 
possible,  and  two  other  men  of  the  16th  century  devised  improvements  upon 
Belaso’s  key  procedure. 

It  is  clear  that  a key  that  changes  with  each  message  provides  more  security 
than  one  that  is  used  over  and  over  for  several  messages.  The  ultimate,  of 
course,  is  a key  that  changes  with  each  message.  The  two  men  devised  an 
exceedingly  clever  way  to  ensure  this  change:  use  the  message  itself  as  its  own 
key.  This  is  called  an  “autokey.”  The  first  system  was  flawed  and  con- 
sequently unusable;  the  inventor  is  remembered  chiefly  for  a contribution  to 
steganography.  The  second  worked  perfectly.  But  though  it  afforded  guaran- 
tees of  security  far  above  those  of  simple  keywords,  and  though  the  author 
described  it  with  clarity,  and  though  his  book  is  one  of  the  most  famous  in 
cryptology,  the  system  fell  into  utter  oblivion  and  its  inventor  owes  his  fame 
to  a crude  and  degenerate  form  of  polyalphabetic  substitution  with  which  he 
had  nothing  to  do  and  which  he  would  have  spurned. 

The  inventor  of  the  first  and  imperfect  autokey  system  was  Girolamo 
Cardano,  a Milanese  physician  and  mathematician  who  is  known  today 
chiefly  as  one  of  the  first  popularizers  of  science  and  as  author  of  the  world’s 
first  text  on  the  theory  of  probability. 

Born  in  1501,  Cardano  had  an  overwhelming  desire  simply  to  be  remem- 
bered— not  even  caring  whether  the  memory  was  of  good  or  of  ill.  He  tried 
to  assure  himself  a place  in  posterity  by  a stupendous  volume  of  writing.  In 
the  131  books  that  he  published  during  his  lifetime  and  the  111  that  he  left 
behind  in  manuscript,  he  discussed  mathematics,  astronomy,  astrology, 
physics,  chess,  gambling  (which  included  his  pioneering  investigation  of 
probability),  the  immortality  of  the  soul,  consolation,  marvelous  cures, 
dialectics,  death,  Nero,  gems  and  colors,  the  zeal  of  Socrates,  poisons,  air, 
water,  nourishment,  dreams,  urine,  teeth,  music,  morals,  and  wisdom.  Some- 
how he  did  not  give  cryptology  a book  of  its  own,  but  inserted  his  informa- 
tion in  his  two  best-selling  popularizations  of  science.  The  first  was  De 
Subtilitate,  a collection  of  illustrations  and  attempted  explanations  of  scienti- 
fic phenomena  that  included  such  topics  as  suggestions  for  teaching  the  blind 
to  read  and  write  by  touch.  Published  in  1550,  De  Subtilitate  embodied  both 


144 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  soundest  physical  learning  of  its  time  and  its  most  advanced  spirit  of 
speculation.  The  public  liked  Cardano’s  anecdotal  exposition  and  his  bizarre 
illustrations  so  much  that  he  followed  it  six  years  later  with  a sort  of  continua- 
tion entitled  De  Rerum  Varietate.  Both  books  were  translated  and  pirated  by 
printers  throughout  Europe. 

In  his  two  discussions  of  cryptology,  Cardano  described  the  classic 
methods  of  antiquity,  attempted  a classification  which  leads  to  an  unfortunate 
self-contradiction,  gave  directions  for  surreptitiously  opening  letters,  laid 
down  some  elementary  rules  for  solving  messages  and  for  developing  secret 
ink,  and  offered  a few  methods  of  his  own,  accompanied  by  the  usual  laud : 
“In  the  case  of  the  methods  that  we  give,  [cryptanalysis]  would  require  an 
Apollo.”  One  of  these  is  his  autokey. 

He  employed  the  plaintext  as  a key  to  encipher  itself,  starting  the  key  over 
from  the  beginning  with  each  new  plaintext  word :

But  while  the  autokey  was  a brilliant  idea,  Cardano  formulated  it  de- 
fectively. First,  it  allows  plural  decipherments.  With  Cardano’s  (standard) 
alphabets,  cipher  n could  stand  for  a plaintext / keyed  with  an  F as  well  as 
for  plaintext  s and  key  S.  Second,  and  worse,  the  decipherer  is  in  exactly  the 
same  position  as  the  cryptanalyst  in  trying  to  figure  out  the  first  plaintext 
word.  This,  once  obtained,  unlocks  the  rest  of  the  message.*  Consequently  this 
formulation  has  been  justly  neglected,  and  the  immortality  that  Cardano  so 
desperately  sought  he  achieved  in  cryptology  with  a system  of  steganography, 
which  bears  his  name. 

The  Cardano  grille  consists  of  a sheet  of  stiff  material,  such  as  cardboard, 
parchment,  or  metal,  into  which  rectangular  holes,  the  height  of  a line  of 
writing  and  of  varying  lengths,  are  cut  at  irregular  intervals.  The  encipherer  lays 
this  mask  over  a sheet  of  writing  paper  and  writes  the  secret  message  through 
the  perforations,  some  of  which  will  take  a whole  word,  others  a single  letter, 
others  a syllable.  He  then  removes  the  grille  and  fills  in  the  remaining  spaces 
with  an  innocuous-sounding  cover  message.  Cardano  prescribed  copying  the 
message  three  times  to  smooth  out  any  irregularities  in  the  writing  that  might 
give  the  secret  away.  The  decipherer  simply  places  his  grille  on  the  message  he 
receives  and  reads  the  hidden  text  through  the  “windows.”  The  method’s 
chief  defect,  of  course,  is  that  awkwardness  in  phrasing  may  betray  the  very 

* In  1564,  Bellaso  (now  spelling  his  name  with  a double  /)  published  a third  edition  of 
his  booklet  in  which  he  described  a form  of  autokey  without  these  obstacles.  It  keys  the  first 
letter  of  the  message  with  the  first  alphabet  and  successive  letters  of  the  first  word  with  suc- 
cessive alphabets.  Then  it  keys  the  first  letter  of  the  second  word  with  the  first  letter  of  the 
first  word,  successive  letters  being  keyed  with  the  succeeding  alphabets.  This  procedure 
— partly  autokey,  partly  progressive — is  repeated  to  the  end  of  the  message.

On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

secret  that  that  phrasing  should  guard:  the  existence  of  a hidden  message. 
Nevertheless,  a number  of  countries  made  use  of  the  Cardano  grille  in  their 
diplomatic  correspondence  in  the  1500s  and  1600s. 

Cardano  also  achieved  the  dubious  renown  of  being  the  first  cryptologist 
to  cite  the  enormous  number  of  variations  inherent  in  a cryptographic  system 
as  “proof”  of  the  impossibility  of  a cryptanalyst’s  ever  reaching  a solution 
during  his  lifetime.  After  describing  a monalphabetic  substitution  in  which 
the  27  permutations  of  three-letter  groups  (aaa,  aab,  aac,  aba,  . . . ccc) 
stand  for  the  24  letters  of  the  alphabet  and  three  common  words,  he  stated: 
“The  [number  of  possible]  arrangements  of  alphabets  will  require  28  digits” 
and  “such  a number  of  arrangements  could  not  be  contained  in  many  books.” 
He  meant  that  the  number  of  ways  in  which  the  27  plaintext  elements  could 
be  mated  to  possible  ciphertext  equivalents  in  trial  solutions  would  require  28 
digits  to  write  out.  As  a matter  of  fact,  it  would  require  29  digits,  since  the 
number  of  combinations  is : 

27  x 26 x 25  x ...  x2x  1,  or  10,888,869,450,418,352,160,768,000,000. 
Cardano  heads  a long  line  of  cryptographers  in  erroneously  placing  crypto- 
graphic faith  in  large  numbers — a line  that  stretches  right  down  to  today.  His 
own  example  refutes  his  argument.  Cryptanalysts  do  not  solve  monoalpha- 
betics — or  any  ciphers  for  that  matter — by  testing  one  key  after  another.  With 
a 26-letter  alphabet,  26  x 25  x . . . x 1,  or,  403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000, 
different  cipher  alphabets  are  possible.  If  the  cryptanalyst  tried  one  of  these 
every  second,  he  would  need  six  quintillion  years,  or  longer  than  the  known 
universe  has  been  in  existence,  to  run  through  them  all.  Yet  most  monoalpha- 
betics  are  solved  in  a matter  of  minutes. 

The  comedy  of  errors  and  neglect  that  constitutes  so  much  of  the  historio- 
graphy of  cryptology  reached  a climax  of  irony  when  it  came  to  the  inventor 
of  the  second  and  acceptable  autokey  system.  It  ignored  this  important 
contribution  and  instead  named  a regressive  and  elementary  cipher  for  him 
though  he  had  nothing  to  do  with  it.  And  so  strong  is  the  grip  of  tradition  that, 
despite  modern  scholarship,  the  name  of  Blaise  de  Vigenere  remains  firmly 
attached  to  what  has  become  the  archetypal  system  of  polyalphabetic  sub- 
stitution and  probably  the  most  famous  cipher  system  of  all  time. 

Vigenere  was  not  a nobleman.  The  “de”  in  his  name  simply  indicates  that 
his  family  came  from  the  village  of  Vigenere  or  Viginaire.  He  himself  was  born 
in  the  village  of  Saint-Pourgain,  about  halfway  between  Paris  and  Marseilles, 
on  April  5,  1523.  At  17,  he  was  taken  from  his  studies  and  sent  to  court  and, 
five  years  later,  to  the  Diet  of  Worms  as  a very  junior  secretary.  This  gave 
him  his  initiation  into  diplomacy,  and  his  subsequent  travels  through  Europe 
broadened  his  experience.  At  24,  he  entered  the  service  of  the  Duke  of 
Nevers,  to  whose  house  he  remained  attached  the  rest  of  his  life,  except  for 
periods  at  court  and  as  a diplomat.  In  1549,  at  26,  he  went  to  Rome  on  a 
two-year  diplomatic  mission.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


It  was  here  that  he  was  first  thrown  into  contact  with  cryptology,  and  he 
seems  to  have  steeped  himself  in  it.  He  read  the  books  of  Trithemius,  Belaso, 
Cardano,  and  Porta,  and  the  unpublished  manuscript  of  Alberti.  He  evidently 
conversed  with  the  experts  of  the  papal  curia,  for  he  tells  anecdotes  that  he 
could  have  heard  only  in  the  shoptalk  of  these  cryptologists.  There  was,  for 
example,  the  one  about  the  fellow  who  was  not  at  all  embarrassed  to  ask  the 
Cardinal  du  Bellay  to  give  him  the  enormous  sum  of  2,000  ecus  for  a cipher 
he  had  devised — but  was  redfaced  to  learn  that  his  system  had  been  solved  in 
less  than  three  hours.  Vigenere  left  the  court  at  39  to  pursue  his  interrupted 
studies,  but  in  1 566  he  was  sent  again  to  Rome  as  secretary  to  King  Charles 
IX.  Here  he  renewed  his  acquaintance  with  the  cryptologic  experts,  and  this 
time  he  appears  to  have  been  admitted  to  their  secret  chambers,  for  it  is  he 
who  reports  having  seen  the  Great  Vicar  of  St.  Peter  solve  a Turkish  crypto- 
gram in  six  hours.  Finally,  in  1570,  at  47,  Vigenere  quit  the  court  for  good, 
turned  over  his  annuity  of  1 ,000  livres  a year  to  the  poor  of  Paris,  married  the 
much  younger  Marie  Vare,  and  devoted  himself  to  his  writing. 

He  turned  out  some  20-odd  books  before  he  died  of  a throat  cancer  in 
1596.  Most  of  his  translations  and  historical  works  have  fallen  into  oblivion, 
though  his  Traicte  des  Cometes  has  been  credited  with  helping  to  destroy  the 
superstition  that  comets  are  fireballs  flung  by  an  angry  God  to  warn  a wicked 
world.  But  the  book  which  is  constantly  cited  by  workers  in  its  field  is  his 
Traicte  des  Chiffres,  which  was  written  in  1585  despite  the  distraction  of  a 
year-old  baby  daughter  and  which  appeared,  elegantly  rubricated,  in  1586, 
and  was  reprinted  the  following  year. 

It  is  a curious  work.  In  its  more  than  600  pages,  it  distilled  not  only  much 
of  the  cryptologic  lore  of  Vigenere’s  day  (with  the  major  exception  of  crypt- 
analysis, which  he  called,  in  a quaint  phrase,  “un  inestimable  rompement  de 
cerveau” — “a  worthless  cracking  of  the  brain”),  but  a hodgepodge  of  other 
topics.  It  contained  the  first  European  representation  of  Japanese  ideograms. 
It  digressed  into  the  foundations  of  alchemy,  licit  and  illicit  magic,  the  secrets 
of  the  kabbalah,  the  mysteries  of  the  universe,  recipes  for  making  gold,  and 
philosophic  speculations.  “All  the  things  in  the  world  constitute  a cipher,”  its 
author  declared.  “All  nature  is  merely  a cipher  and  a secret  writing.  The  great 
name  and  essence  of  God  and  his  wonders,  the  very  deeds,  projects,  words, 
actions,  and  demeanor  of  mankind — what  are  they  for  the  most  part  but  a 
cipher?”  And  so  on.  There  may  be  some  allegorical  truth  to  this — Pascal 
himself  was  to  say  that  the  Old  Testament  was  a cipher — but  it  hardly 
advanced  the  science  of  cryptology. 

Despite  these  ramblings,  the  Traicte  is  reliable  in  its  cryptologic  informa- 
tion. Vigenere  was  scrupulous  in  assigning  credit  for  material  from  other 
authors,  and  he  quoted  them  accurately  and  with  comprehension.  He  relished 
a good  story,  such  as  the  one  about  the  practical  joke  played  on  one  Paulo 
Pancatuccio.  Pancatuccio,  Vigenere  said,  had  been  employed  by  the  pope  to 
solve  documents  in  cipher,  “in  which  in  truth  he  was  fairly  well  versed,  and 


147 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

performed  several  minor  miracles  of  the  lesser  kind.”  Certain  “bons  com- 
pagnons,”  wishing  to  humble  his  pride,  contrived  to  have  a letter  in  cipher, 
marked  “most  important,”  fall  into  Pancatuccio’s  hands.  The  opening  words 
were  in  a very  simple  transposition  cipher,  and  Pancatuccio  solved  it  readily, 
only  to  read:  “O  poor  wretched  slave  that  you  are  to  your  decipherments,  on 
which  you  waste  all  your  oil  and  your  pains,  what  does  it  profit  you  to  eat 
out  your  heart  in  the  quest  of  these  vain  curiosities,  presuming  by  your 
laborious  researches  to  be  able  to  attain  to  the  discovery  of  the  secrets  of 
others,  which  are  reserved  to  God  alone?”  More  in  the  same  vein  followed, 
ending  with  a challenge  to  see  if  Pancatuccio  could  get  at  the  meaning  of  “one 
little  letter”  of  the  succeeding  message.  It  was  written  in  a complicated  cipher; 
Vigenere  thoroughly  described  it,  but  never  said  whether  the  indignant  Pan- 
catuccio even  bothered  to  try  solving  it. 

Among  the  numerous  ciphers  that  Vigenere  discussed  (such  as  concealing 
a message  in  a picture  of  a field  of  stars)  were  polyalphabetics.  Each  of  his 
used  a Trithemius-like  tableau,  though  Vigenere  provided  for  mixed  alphabets 
at  the  top  and  the  side.  He  listed  a variety  of  key  methods:  words,  phrases, 
lines  of  poetry,  the  date  of  the  dispatch,  progressive  use  of  all  the  alphabets. 
He  then  put  forth  his  autokey  system.  Like  Cardano’s,  it  used  the  plaintext 
as  the  key.  But  it  perfected  Cardano’s  in  two  ways.  First,  it  provided  a priming 
key.  This  consisted  of  a single  letter,  known  to  both  encipherer  and  decipherer, 
with  which  the  decipherer  could  decipher  the  first  cryptogram  letter  and  so 
get  a start  on  his  work.  With  this,  he  would  get  the  first  plaintext  letter,  then 
use  this  as  the  key  to  decipher  the  second  cryptogram  letter,  use  that  plaintext 
as  the  key  to  decipher  the  third  cryptogram  letter,  and  so  on.  Secondly, 
Vigenere,  unlike  Cardano,  did  not  recommence  his  key  with  each  plaintext 
word,  which  is  a weakness,  but  kept  it  running  continuously.

cipher  x i ahg  up  tmlshixt 

The  system  works  well  and  affords  fair  guarantees  of  security;  it  has  been 
embodied  in  a number  of  modern  cipher  machines. 

Vigenere  also  described  a second  autokey  in  which  the  cryptogram  itself 
serves  as  the  key  after  a priming  key: 

key  DX  HEE  CO  U MXGNABQ 

plain  au  nom  de  l’eternel 

cipher  xh  eec  ou  mxgnabqo 

This  has  the  advantage  of  being  an  incoherent  key  but  has  the  great  dis- 
advantage of  leaving  the  key  in  full  view  of  the  cryptanalyst. 

In  spite  of  Vigenere’s  clear  exposition  of  his  devices,  both  were  entirely 
forgotten  and  only  entered  the  stream  of  cryptology  late  in  the  19th  century 


148 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


after  they  were  reinvented.  Writers  on  cryptology  then  added  insult  to  injury 
by  degrading  Vigenere’s  system  into  one  much  more  elementary. 

The  cipher  now  universally  called  the  Vigenere  employs  only  standard 
alphabets  and  a short  repeating  keyword — a system  far  more  susceptible  to 
solution  than  Vigenere’s  autokey.  Its  tableau  consists  of  a modern  tabula 
recta:  26  standard  horizontal  alphabets,  each  slid  one  space  to  the  left 
of  the  one  above.  These  are  the  cipher  alphabets.  A normal  alphabet  for 
the  plaintext  stands  at  the  top.  Another  normal  alphabet,  which  merely 
repeats  the  initial  letters  of  the  horizontal  ciphertext  alphabets,  runs  down  the 
left  side.  This  is  the  key  alphabet.  Both  correspondents  must  know  the  key- 
word. The  encipherer  repeats  this  above  the  plaintext  letters  until  each  one 
has  a keyletter.  He  seeks  the  plaintext  letter  in  the  top  alphabet  and  the  key- 
letter  in  the  side.  Then  he  traces  down  from  the  top  and  in  from  the  side.  The 
ciphertext  letter  stands  at  the  intersection  of  the  column  and  the  row.  The 
encipherer  repeats  this  process  with  all  the  letters  of  the  plaintext.  To  decipher, 
the  clerk  begins  with  the  keyletter,  runs  in  along  the  ciphertext  alphabet  until 
he  strikes  the  cipher  letter,  then  follows  the  column  of  letters  upward  until  he 
emerges  at  the  plaintext  letter  at  the  top.  For  example: 

key  TYPETYPETYPETYPETYPETYPET 
plain  nowi  st  het  i mef  oral  1 goodmen 
cipher  a mlmlrwi  mgbiymoeej  vshbbig 

This  system  is  clearly  more  susceptible  to  solution  than  Vigenere's  original. 
Nevertheless,  a legend  grew  up  that  this  degenerate  form  of  Vigenere’s  work 
was  the  indecipherable  cipher  par  excellence,  a legend  so  hardy  that  as  late  as 
1917,  more  than  half  a century  after  it  had  been  exploded,  the  Vigenere  was 
being  touted  as  “impossible  of  translation”  in  a journal  as  respected  as 
Scientific  American ! 

The  cryptanalysts  of  the  time  did  not  create  the  legend.  They  knew  very 
well  that  the  cipher  was  not  “impossible  of  translation” — because  they  them- 
selves had  occasionally  translated  it.  “I  may  at  this  point  mention,”  wrote 
Porta,  “a  letter  of  this  sort  sent  me  a while  ago  by  a dabbler  in  ciphers  who 
lived  at  Rome.  To  his  surprise,  I interpreted  it  within  the  very  hour  I received 
it — because  the  key  of  the  message  was  the  proverb  OMNIA  VINCIT  AMOR, 
which  is  familiar  to  almost  everybody.”  And  Giovanni  Batista  Argenti  noted 
under  a Porta-like  cipher  in  his  book  of  cipher  keys: 

Qaetepeeeacszmddfictzadqgbpleaqtacui. 

(In  principio  erat)  such  is  the  motto  or  key*  with  which  the  Illustrious  and 

Excellent  Signor  lacorno  Boncampagni  [nephew  of  Pope  Gregory  XIII],  Duke 

of  Sora,  my  patron,  wrote  the  above  line  in  cipher  and  gave  it  to  me  Sunday  8 

* The  key  in  full  is  actually  IN  PRINCIPIO  ERAT  VERBUM.  The  third-to-last  letter 
of  the  ciphertext,  c,  should  be  i.

On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

October  1581  in  the  Tusculana  villa,  telling  me  that  it  was  not  possible  to  find  it 
out,  and  I quickly  found  out  the  countercipher  which  was  of  10  alphabets  and 
the  motto.  The  line  written  above  means  and  is  this: 

Arma  virumque  cano  troie  qui  primus  ab  oris. 

Matteo  Argenti  also  boasted  of  solving  a test  polyalphabetic,  but  he  may 
simply  have  been  claiming  his  uncle’s  success  as  his  own.

The  modern  Vigenere  tableau 


Both  the  Porta  and  the  Argenti  solutions  owe  their  success  to  the  easily 
guessable  nature  of  their  keys — a common  proverb  in  one,  the  first  words  of 
the  Gospel  of  St.  John  in  the  other.  The  Argenti  solution  was  further  simpli- 
fied by  a plaintext  consisting  of  the  first  line  of  Vergil’s  Aeneid.  Even  without 
these  aids,  polyalphabetics  might  occasionally  have  been  solved  if  several 
other  conditions  obtained:  if  the  cryptograms  retained  original  word  divi- 
sions, if  the  cipher  alphabets  were  normal,  and  if  the  cryptanalyst  recognized 
that  keys  repeat.  He  could  then  guess  at  words  in  the  plaintext  and  recover 


150 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


part  of  the  key  that  would  have  been  used;  if  it  made  sense,  he  would  try  to 
guess  the  rest  of  it  or,  failing  that,  try  to  decipher  other  portions  of  the 
cryptogram.  Such  hit-or-miss  solutions  were  not  entirely  beyond  the  reach  of 
the  Renaissance.  Porta  recognized  key  repetition  in  his  artificial  solution:  “I 
conclude  that  the  key  has  been  given  three  times  and  decide  correctly  that  it 
consists  of  17  letters.”  And  Vigenere  hints  at  such  knowledge  when  he 
comments  that  “the  longer  the  key  is,  the  more  difficult  it  is  to  solve  the 
cipher.” 

Yet  the  mere  elimination  of  word  divisions  would  greatly  reduce  the 
possibility  of  striking  the  right  plaintext,  and  simply  mixing  the  cipher 
alphabets  would  deny  the  Renaissance  cryptanalyst  any  opportunity  whatever 
for  solution.  The  cryptographers  of  the  time  ran  words  together  as  standard 
practice,  and  they  knew  of  techniques  for  mixing  alphabets.  Hence  they  had 
the  power  to  make  polyalphabetics  unbreakable  to  their  contemporaries. 
This  explains  Matteo's  paean:  “The  key  cipher  is  the  noblest  and  the  greatest 
in  the  world,  the  most  secure  and  faithful  that  never  was  there  man  who  could 
find  it  out.” 

Why,  then,  did  the  nomenclator  reign  supreme  for  300  years  after  Porta? 
Why  did  cryptographers  not  use  this  “noblest”  and  “most  secure”  cipher 
instead  ? 

Apparently  because  they  disliked  its  slowness  and  distrusted  its  accuracy. 
Encipherment  in  a polyalphabetic  system,  with  its  need  to  keep  track  of  which 
alphabet  was  in  use  at  every  point  and  to  make  sure  that  the  ciphertext  letter 
was  taken  from  that  alphabet,  could  not  compare  in  speed  with  a nomenclator 
encipherment.  A former  ambassador  of  Louis  XIV,  Franqois  de  Callieres, 
declared  in  1716  in  his  classic  manual  of  diplomacy,  De  la  Maniere  de 
Negocier  avec  les  Souveraens,  that  unbreakability  could  be  attained  by  “an 
infinite  number  of  different  keys”  based  upon  “a  general  Model.”  “I  do  not 
speak,”  he  added,  in  an  apparent  reference  to  polyalphabetics,  “of  certain 
ciphers,  invented  by  professors  in  a University  and  upon  rules  of  Algebra  or 
Arithmetick;  which  are  impractical  by  reason  of  their  too  great  Length,  and 
of  the  Difficulties  in  using  them;  but  of  common  Cyphers  which  all  Ministers 
make  use  of,  and  with  which  one  may  write  a Dispatch  almost  as  fast  as  with 
ordinary  Letters.”  The  well-informed  author  of  an  anonymous  17th-century 
“Traitte  de  l’art  de  deschiffrer”  in  the  Royal  Archives  at  Brussels  stated  that 
chancelleries  do  not  use  polyalphabetics  because  it  takes  too  long  to  encipher 
them  and  because  the  dropping  of  a single  ciphertext  letter  garbles  the  message 
from  that  point  on.  In  1819,  William  Blair,  in  a superb  encyclopedia  article  on 
cryptology,  likewise  argued  that  polyalphabetic  substitution  “requires  too 
much  time”  and  that  "by  the  least  mistake  in  writing  is  so  confounded,  that 
the  confederate  with  his  key  shall  never  set  it  in  order  again.” 

One  might  think  that  cipher  clerks  might  have  corrected  such  garbles  by 
trial  and  error,  especially  in  those  more  leisurely  days.  But  they  were  not 
cryptanalysts  and  may  not  have  known,  or  have  wanted  to  know,  how  to 


151 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 


make  the  necessary  trials.  Serious  garbles  would  thus  render  the  dispatch 
unreadable  until  a courier  went  out  and  returned  with  a correction ; thus  the 
cipher  would  have  prevented  communication  instead  of  safeguarding  it. 
Garbles  of  just  this  type,  so  bad  that  messages  could  not  be  read,  compelled 
two  highly  intelligent  Americans,  both  Framers  of  the  Constitution,  to 
abandon  the  use  of  a polyalphabetic  system. 

Although  a lack  of  speed  and  a proneness  to  error  kept  polyalphabetics 
from  supplanting  the  nomenclator,  they  cropped  up  now  and  again.  The 
author  of  the  “Traitte”  says  that  they  were  used  in  Holland  from  time  to 
time.  On  October  12,  1601,  the  Jesuits  sent  a numerical  polyalphabetic  with 
keyword  CUMBRE  to  Peru  for  communications  with  Rome.  And,  despite 
the  myth  of  their  unbreakability,  polyalphabetics  were  broken  occasionally. 
The  Argentis,  who  would  not  use  them  for  regular  traffic,  sometimes  gave 
them  to  cardinals  for  personal  use.  One  such  was  the  “cifra  con  mons. 
revmo  Panicarola  apresso  l’illmo  signor  [Enrico]  cardinal  Caetano  legato  in 
Francia,  3 Ottobre  1589.”  Pope  Sixtus  V had  dispatched  Caetano  to  France 
to  further  Holy  League  efforts  against  Henry  IV.  The  cipher’s  first  two 
alphabets,  with  their  key  letters  at  left,  were: 


AB 

CD 


a b c d e 

m n o p q 

a b c d e 

n o p q r 


f g h i 1

The  Argentis  made  its  two  keys  prudently  long  (FUNDAMENTA  EIUS 
IN  MONTIBIS  SANCTIS  and  GLORIOSA  DICENTUR  DE  TE  QUIA 
POTENTER  AGIS),  assigned  K,  X,  and  Y as  nulls,  and  attached  a small 
nomenclator  of  letters  with  dots,  macrons,  or  circumflexes  over  them.  They 
had  considered  giving  Panicarola  a polyalphabetic  whose  alphabets  included 
the  ten  digits  and  so  might  be  considered  mixed,  but  instead  settled  on  this 
normal-alphabet  one — “easier  and  more  secure,”  they  said. 

It  was  the  cipher’s  undoing.  The  curia  used  it  to  tell  Caetano  in  the  middle 
of  the  following  year  that  Sixtus  had  died — obviously  news  of  the  greatest 
importance.  One  of  Henry’s  Huguenot  commanders,  chronicling  the  intercep- 
tion of  the  messages,  wrote  that  “because  the  letters  were  in  double  cipher* 
and  very  difficult,  it  was  necessary  to  put  them  in  the  hands  of  Chorrin,  who 
disentangled  all  that  had  stopped  the  others  and  in  his  time  has  not  had  his 
equal  in  this  perfection.”  Chorrin,  who  was  a contemporary  of  Viete  and 
who,  from  this  feat  alone,  would  appear  to  be  his  equal  in  ability  if  not  in 
fame,  also  solved  some  other  letetrs  for  Henry’s  minister  of  finance,  Sully. 

At  about  the  same  time,  the  cipherers  of  Elizabethan  England  set  sail  upon 


* A term  meaning  polyalphabetics,  derived  from  the  two  “keys”  needed — one  the 
cipher  alphabet,  the  other  the  keyword  or  keyphrase.  It  survives  in  modern  French  usage 
as  “double-key  cipher.”

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  uncharted  seas  of  polyalphabeticity  with  Drake-like  daring.  They  em- 
ployed a Porta-like  tableau  to  correspond  with  several  envoys,  and  a Vigenere 
for  a Mr.  Asheley.  Another  system  comprises  the  oldest  device  of  its  type  in 
the  world.  It  consists  of  a vertical  strip  of  stout  cardboard  on  which  is  written 
a normal  plaintext  alphabet.  Slits  were  cut  in  the  cardboard  down  both  sides 
of  the  alphabet,  and  through  these  slits  was  inserted  a sheet  of  paper  on 
which  ten  different  cipher  alphabets  were  vertically  inscribed.  The  paper  could 
be  moved  through  the  slits  so  as  to  bring  the  desired  cipher  alphabets  against 
the  plaintext  one.  This  facilitated  the  reading  of  ciphertext  equivalents. 

Writers  on  cryptology  in  the  1600s  occasionally  referred  to  the  solution  of 
polyalphabetics.  They  did  so  in  vague  terms,  probably  reflecting  their  own 
indefinite  thinking  and  the  loss  of  knowledge  that  let  the  myth  of  unbreak- 
ability  take  root.  Thus  Antonio  Maria  Cospi,  secretary  to  the  grand  duke  of 
Tuscany,  mentioned  in  his  1639  La  interpretazione  delle  cifre  “two  kinds  of 
ciphers,  some  simple  and  some  composite  ...  the  latter  practically  impossible 
to  discover  and  decipher.”  And  later  he  wrote  that  “The  present  method  may 
not  be  at  all  useless  for  the  interpretation  of  the  more  difficult  simple  ciphers 
...  no  more  than  for  that  of  double  and  composite  ciphers.”  The  author  of 
the  Brussels  “Traitte,”  who  demonstrated  his  capability  when  he  solved  a 
French  royal  cipher  for  Spain  in  1676,  floundered  when  he  came  to  poly- 
alphabeticity. He  could  only  suggest  the  almost  useless  technique  of  trying 
one  probable  plaintext  letter  after  another  until  a coherent  combination 
appeared  in  the  key  he  derived.  Understandably,  he  did  not  illustrate  his 
protracted  method;  the  number  of  combinations  is  so  great  that  he  would 
be  at  it  yet.  His  failure  contrasts  markedly  with  the  technical  mastery  dis- 
played in  the  rest  of  the  treatise. 

The  time  and  place  of  the  writing  of  that  “Traitte,”  the  author's  failure 
with  polyalphabeticity,  and  his  allegiance  to  Spain  make  it  probable  that  he 
was  a cryptanalyst  named  Martin,  who  figured  in  an  incident  that  shows  how 
rare  and  fortuitous  was  the  solution  of  a polyalphabetic.  The  Cardinal  de 
Retz,  that  liberal  and  popular  French  prelate-politician,  narrated  in  his 
Memoires  how  he  escaped  from  the  chateau  of  Nantes  on  August  8,  1 654, 
after  two  years  of  political  imprisonment.  He  digressed  to  discuss  ciphers: 

I had  one  with  Madame  La  Palatine,  which  we  called  The  Indecipherable, 
because  it  always  seemed  to  us  that  no  one  could  penetrate  it  without  knowing 
the  word  that  had  been  agreed  upon.  We  placed  such  complete  confidence  in  it 
that  we  never  hesitated  to  write  freely  and  to  send  the  most  important  and  the 
most  confidential  secrets  by  ordinary  courier.  It  was  in  this  cipher  that  I wrote  to 
the  Premier  President  [of  the  Parlement  of  Paris]  that  1 would  escape  on  August 
8 . . . The  Prince  [of  Conde],  who  had  one  of  the  best  decipherers  in  the  world, 
named,  it  seems  to  me,  Martin,  held  this  cipher  six  weeks  with  me  in  Brussels.* 
And  he  told  me  that  Martin  had  confessed  to  him  that  it  was  indecipherable.  . . . 
It  was  broken  down  sometime  afterwards  by  [Guy]  Joly  [a  counselor  to  the 

* Retz  visited  Conde  in  Brussels  in  1658. 


153 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

Chatelet  tribunal  in  Paris  and  one  of  Retz’s  followers],  who,  though  not  a pro- 
fessional decipherer,  hit  upon  its  key  while  reflecting  on  it  and  brought  it  to  me 
at  Utrecht,  where  I was  at  the  time. 

Retz  was  trying  to  show  “how  little  confidence  one  can  place  in  ciphers,”  but 
the  fact  that  it  took  a lucky  guess  by  an  intimate  to  effect  the  only  solution  in 
six  years  seems  rather  to  enhance  the  cipher’s  value. 

The  most  interesting  polyalphabetic  solution  of  the  nomenclator  years 
came  a century  later.  Its  interest  derives  from  a cryptanalyst  who  has 
become  a very  prototype  in  a field  utterly  removed  from  cryptanalysis,  and 
whose  obsession  with  that  field  was  such  that  he  even  turned  cryptanalysis  to 
account  in  it. 

It  all  happened  in  1757,  when  he  was  talking  about  magic,  alchemy,  and 
chemistry  with  his  friend,  the  wealthy  Madame  d’Urfe.  She  showed  him  a 
cipher  manuscript  describing  the  transmutation  of  baser  metals  into  gold,  and 
told  him  that  she  did  not  need  to  keep  it  locked  up  because  she  alone  held  the 
key.  She  gave  it  to  him,  remarking  that  she  did  not  believe  in  cryptanalysis. 
“Five  or  six  weeks  later,”  he  stated  in  his  memoirs,  “she  asked  me  if  I had 
deciphered  the  manuscript  which  had  the  transmutation  procedure.  I told  her 
that  I had.”  But  Madame  d’Urfe,  still  skeptical,  replied: 

“Without  the  key,  sir,  excuse  me  if  I believe  the  thing  impossible.” 

“Do  you  wish  me  to  name  your  key,  madame?” 

“If  you  please.” 

I then  told  her  the  word,  which  belonged  to  no  language,  and  I saw  her  sur- 
prise. She  told  me  that  it  was  impossible,  for  she  believed  herself  the  only  pos- 
sessor of  that  word  which  she  kept  in  her  memory  and  which  she  had  never 
written  down. 

I could  have  told  her  the  truth — that  the  same  calculation  which  had  served 
me  for  deciphering  the  manuscript  had  enabled  me  to  learn  the  word — but  on  a 
caprice  it  struck  me  to  tell  her  that  a genie  had  revealed  it  to  me.  This  false  dis- 
closure fettered  Madame  d’Urfe  to  me.  That  day  I became  the  master  of  her 
soul,  and  I abused  my  power.  Every  time  I think  of  it,  I am  distressed  and 
ashamed,  and  I do  penance  now  in  the  obligation  under  which  I place  myself  of 
telling  the  truth  in  writing  my  memoirs. 

But  this  did  not  stop  him  at  the  time  from  amazing  the  lady  with  some  hocus- 
pocus  in  producing  the  keyword  (NABUCODONOSOR,  an  Italian  spelling 
of  “Nebuchadnezzar”),  and  then  taking  his  leave  “bearing  with  me  her  soul, 
her  heart,  her  wits  and  all  the  good  sense  that  she  had  left.” 

The  cryptanalyst?  Casanova. 

Less  dramatic  solutions  of  polyalphabetics  occurred  early  in  the  1800s 
before  a retired  German  infantry  major  published  the  general  solution  in 
1863.  It  may  seem  that  so  many  solutions  should  have  dispelled  the  myth  of 
polyalphabetic  unbreakability.  But  they  were  isolated  instances,  scores  of 
years  apart,  so  unusual  that  standard  works  on  cryptology  do  not  mention 


154 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


them.  Polyalphabetics  remained  freaks  of  cryptologic  usage.  The  profes- 
sionals avoided  them.  Their  very  unpopularity  protected  them.  Had  they  been 
used  more,  perhaps  the  coincidences  that  lit  the  way  to  the  general  solution 
would  have  forced  themselves  upon  cryptologists.  But  the  world  fixated  upon 
the  nomenclator,  and  so  the  legend  of  unbreakability  flourished. 

It  was  fed  by  the  lesser  writings  of  the  time.  These  books  shed  no  new 
light  on  polyalphabetics  and  none  on  the  political  cryptology  of  their  day. 
They  are  divorced  from  the  realities,  and  generally  content  themselves  with 
commentaries  on  earlier  works,  chiefly  Trithemius,  and  with  describing  a few 
trivial  inventions.  Neglect  justly  entombs  most.  A few  are  of  minor  interest. 

The  Florentine  Jacopo  Silvestri  published  the  second  printed  book  on 
cryptology  at  Rome  in  1526.  His  Opus  novum  . . . begins  with  a Dantesque 
scene  of  the  author  fleeing  the  plague  at  Rome  to  a small  country  estate  near 
the  Tiber.  There  he  received  a visit  from  an  Etruscan  friend,  who,  discoursing 
with  him  on  ancient  modes  of  writing,  discussed  cryptology.  Silvestri’s  friend 
begged  him  to  write  down  his  knowledge  of  it  for  universal  advantage.  But 
most  of  the  88  pages  of  the  Opus  novum  are  merely  given  over  to  a vocabulary 
that  can  serve  as  the  basis  for  a small  code. 

In  1624,  Augustus  II,  Duke  of  Braunschweig-Liineberg  (afterwards 
Hanover)  in  Germany,  issued  his  Cryptomenytices  et  Cryptographiae  libri  IX 
under  the  pseudonym  Gustavus  Selenus.  This  was  a play  on  his  name, 
gustavus  being  an  anagram  (with  the  interchangeable  u and  v of  the  time)  of 
Augustus,  and  Selene,  the  Greek  goddess  of  the  moon,  which  is  “luna”  in 
Latin,  standing  for  Liineberg.  The  duke,  who  was  cousin  to  the  grandfather 
of  George  I of  England,  is  probably  the  highest  ranking  author  of  a book  on 
cryptology;  both  he  and  the  present  queen  of  England  descend  from  Ernest 
the  Confessor,  of  the  house  of  Guelph.  He  prefaced  the  almost  500  small- 
folio  pages  of  his  volume  with  17  pages  of  tributes  from  his  courtiers  (“As, 
what  night  in  dusty  cloak  conceals,  bright  Cynthia  soon  with  torch  full- 
flaming  shows, /So,  too,  Gustavus  now,  Selenus  called,  uncovers  things  that 
time  has  long  in  shadow  held”).  One  such,  a particularly  laudatory  one 
entitled  a “Sportive  Poem,”  was  contributed  to  this  volume  of  the  supposedly 
unknown  Selenus  by  none  other  than  the  gracious  Duke  Augustus  himself! 
But  the  work,  while  containing  some  cipher  systems,  mainly  defends  the 
occultism  of  Trithemius. 

The  most  celebrated  scholar  of  his  day,  the  Jesuit  Athanasius  Kircher,  who 
had  won  fame  by  his  “solution”  of  hieroglyphics  and  by  his  having  been 
lowered  into  the  crater  of  Vesuvius  to  study  underground  forces  (a  feat  that, 
with  a book  on  the  subterranean  world,  won  him  the  title  of  Father  of 
Vulcanology),  published  his  Polygraphia  nova  et  universalis  at  Rome  in  1663. 
The  book  contains  chiefly  processes  of  encipherment,  as  well  as  a multi- 
lingual, cross-indexed  code  which  is  one  of  the  earliest  essays  at  a universal 
language.  Two  years  later,  his  student,  Gaspar  Schott,  a Jesuit  physicist, 


155 


On  the  Origin  of  a Species 

brought  out  Schola  steganographia  at  Nuremberg.  Schott’s  book,  like  his 
teacher’s,  is  largely  a compilation  of  cipher  systems. 

Only  two  English  works  of  the  period  merit  attention.  The  first  book  in 
English  on  cryptology  appeared  anonymously  in  1641,  but  Mercury,  or  the 
Secret  and  Swift  Messenger  was  the  offspring  of  John  Wilkins,  a “lustie,  strong 
growne  . . . broad  shouldered”  young  chaplain  who  later  married  Oliver 
Cromwell’s  sister  and  became  Bishop  of  Chester  and  a founder  and  first 
secretary  of  the  Royal  Society.  A succinct  volume,  very  well  grounded  in  the 
classics,  Mercury  introduced  the  words  cryptographia  (defined  by  Wilkins  as 
“secrecy  in  writing”)  and  cryptologia  (“secrecy  in  speech”)  into  English.  The 
author  reserved  the  term  cryptomeneses,  or  “private  intimations,”  for  the  art 
of  secret  communication  in  general.  In  addition  to  summing  up  the  know- 
ledge of  the  time,  Wilkins  depicted  three  kinds  of  geometrical  cipher,  a 
mystifying  system  in  which  a message  is  represented  by  dots,  lines,  or  triangles. 
The  letters  of  the  alphabet,  in  normal  or  mixed  order,  were  written  out  at 
known  spatial  intervals;  this  served  as  the  key.  This  line  of  letters  was  held  at 
the  top  of  a sheet  of  paper,  and  the  message  was  spelled  out  by  marking  a dot 
for  each  plaintext  letter  underneath  that  letter  in  the  key  alphabet,  each  dot 
lower  than  its  predecessor.  The  dots  could  then  be  connected  by  twos  to  form 
lines,  by  threes  to  form  triangles,  or  all  together  to  form  what  would  look  like 
a graph — or  they  could  be  left  as  dots.  The  receiver,  who  had  an  identically 
proportioned  key,  noted  the  positions  of  the  dots,  the  ends  of  the  lines,  or  the 
apexes  of  the  triangles  against  the  alphabetical  scale  to  read  the  plaintext. 

The  second  English  book  on  the  subject  excelled.  Cryptomenytices 
Patefacta  was  written  by  John  Falconer,  about  whom  nothing  is  known  except 
that  he  was  a distant  relative  of  the  Scottish  philosopher  David  Hume,  was 
reportedly  entrusted  with  the  private  cipher  of  the  future  King  James  II,  and 
died  in  France  while  following  James  into  temporary  exile  there.  The  book 
came  out  posthumously  in  1685,  with  its  author  listed  only  as  “J.F.”  It 
proved  so  popular  that  it  was  reissued  in  1692  with  a new  title  page  that 
clearly  indicates  just  what  its  180  pages  comprise:  Rules  for  Explaining  and 
Decyphering  all  Manner  of  Secret  Writing.  . . . 

Falconer’s  cryptanalytical  bias  sharpened  his  comments  on  the  standard 
systems,  and  led  him  to  make  a praiseworthy  assault  on  that  old  bugbear, 
polyalphabetic  substitution.  He  suggested  guessing  at  the  short  words  in  a 
cryptogram,  deducing  the  keyletters  (these  were  standard  alphabets),  and 
seeing  whether  “they  can  be  joyned  to  make  up  part  of  the  Key.”  Knowing  the 
number  of  letters  in  the  key  is  a great  help,  he  says,  “since  thereby  you  have 
the  several  Returns  of  each  Alphabet.”  The  technique  is  quite  valid  for 
cryptograms  with  word  divisions,  and  bespeaks  an  acute  mind.  Falconer  also 
gave  what  seems  to  be  the  earliest  illustration  of  keyed  columnar  transposi- 
tion, a cipher  that  is  today  the  primary  and  most  widely  used  transposition 
cipher,  having  served  (with  modifications)  for  French  military  ciphers, 
Japanese  diplomatic  superencipherments,  and  Soviet  spy  ciphers.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


These  five  books,  plus  the  even  less  important  ones  that  were  also  pub- 
lished at  this  period,  have — with  the  possible  exception  of  Falconer’s — a 
certain  air  of  unreality  about  them.  There  is  good  reason  for  this.  The  authors 
borrowed  their  knowledge  from  earlier  volumes  and  puffed  it  out  with  their 
own  hypothesizing,  which  seems  never  to  have  been  deflated  by  contact  with 
the  bruising  actuality  of  solving  cryptograms  that  they  themselves  had  not 
made  up.  The  literature  of  cryptology  was  all  theory  and  no  practice.  The 
authors  did  not  know  the  real  cryptology  that  was  being  practiced  in  locked 
rooms  here  and  there  throughout  Europe,  by  uncommunicative  men  working 
stealthily  to  further  the  grand  designs  of  state.

THE  ERA  OF  THE  BLACK  CHAMBERS 


realmont  was  under  siege.  The  royal  army,  under  Henry  II  of  Bourbon, 
Prince  of  Conde,  had  invested  it  at  dawn  Wednesday,  April  19,  1628.  But  the 
Huguenots,  inside  the  battlements  of  the  little  town  in  southern  France, 
were  putting  up  a stiff  defense.  They  cannonaded  Conde  from  a tower  and 
contemptuously  rejected  his  demands  that  they  surrender,  saying  that  they 
would  die  instead.  Conde  brought  up  five  big  cannon  from  Albi,  a dozen 
miles  away,  and  on  Sunday  ranged  them  in  an  ominous  line  facing  Realmont. 

That  same  day  his  soldiers  captured  an  inhabitant  of  the  town  who  was 
trying  to  carry  an  enciphered  message  to  Huguenot  forces  outside.  None  of 
Conde’s  men  could  unriddle  it,  but  during  the  week  the  prince  learned  that 
it  might  be  solved  by  the  scion  of  a leading  family  of  Albi  who  was  known 
to  have  an  interest  in  ciphers. 

Conde  sent  him  the  cryptogram.  The  young  man  solved  it  on  the  spot. 
It  revealed  that  the  Huguenots  desperately  needed  munitions  and  that,  if 
they  were  not  supplied,  they  would  have  to  yield.  This  was  news  indeed,  for 
despite  the  destruction  of  a number  of  houses  by  the  Catholic  batteries,  the 
town  was  continuing  to  resist  stoutly  with  no  sign  of  surrender.  Conde 
returned  the  cryptogram  to  the  inhabitants,  and  on  Sunday,  April  30,  1628, 
though  its  fortifications  were  still  unbreached  and  its  defenses  still  apparently 
adequate  for  a long  siege,  Realmont  suddenly  and  unexpectedly  capitulated. 
With  this  dramatic  success  began  the  career  of  the  man  who  was  to  become 
France’s  first  full-time  cryptologist:  the  great  Antoine  Rossignol. 

When  word  of  the  incident  reached  Cardinal  Richelieu,  the  astute  and 
able  Gray  Eminence  of  France,  he  at  once  attached  this  useful  talent  to  his 
suite.  Rossignol  proved  his  worth  almost  immediately.  The  Catholic  armies 
under  Richelieu  surrounding  the  chief  Huguenot  bastion  of  La  Rochelle 
intercepted  some  letters  in  cipher,  which  the  young  codebreaker  of  Albi  read 
with  ease.  He  told  His  Eminence  that  the  starving  citizens  were  eagerly 
awaiting  help  that  the  English  had  promised  to  send  by  sea.  When  the  fleet 
arrived,  the  primed  guardships  and  forts  so  intimidated  it  that  it  stood  off  the 
port’s  entrance  and  made  no  serious  attempt  to  force  a passage.  A month 
later,  the  city  capitulated  in  full  sight  of  the  English  vessels — and  the  great 
French  tradition  of  expertise  in  cryptology  had  been  founded. 

157 


158 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Rossignol  very  quickly  established  himself  in  the  royal  service.  By  1630, 
his  solutions  had  made  him  rich  enough  to  build  a small  but  elegant  chateau 
at  Juvisy,  12  miles  south  of  Paris,  later  surrounding  it  with  a charming 
informal  garden  designed  by  Le  Notre,  the  gardener  of  Versailles.  Here 
Louis  XIII  stopped  to  visit  the  young  cryptanalyst  in  1634,  1635  and  1636  on 
his  returns  to  Paris  from  Fontainebleau. 

In  the  swashbuckling  court  of  that  monarch,  and  then  in  the  resplendent 
one  of  Louis  XIV,  Rossignol  served  with  an  extraordinary  facility.  The 
stronghold  of  Hesdin  surrendered  a week  sooner  than  it  otherwise  would 
have  because  he  solved  an  enciphered  plea  for  help,  and  then  composed  a 
reply  in  the  same  cipher  telling  the  townspeople  how  futile  their  hopes  were. 
How  many  other  towns  he  compelled  to  surrender,  how  many  diplomatic 
coups  he  made  possible,  how  many  betrayals  he  uncovered  among  the  great 
nobles  in  those  days  of  shifting  allegiances,  he  never  discussed.  This  reticence 
caused  some  at  the  court  to  charge  that  he  never  actually  solved  a single 
cipher,  and  that  the  cardinal  spread  inflated  rumors  about  his  abilities  to 
discourage  would-be  conspirators.  But  in  fact  Richelieu  was  frequently 
telling  his  subordinates  such  things  as,  “It  is  necessary  to  make  use,  in  my 
opinion,  of  the  letters  of  the  man  who  has  been  arrested  by  the  civil  authorities 
at  Mezieres,  that  is  to  say,  have  them  put  into  Rossignol’s  hands  to  see  if 
there  is  something  important  in  them.”  Or,  eight  years  later,  in  1642,  writing 
to  Messieurs  de  Noyers  and  de  Chavigny:  “I  saw,  in  some  extracts,  that 
Rossignol  sent  me,  a truce  negotiation  of  the  King  of  England  with  the 
Prince  of  Orange;  I do  not  think  that  it  can  have  any  effect,  but  ...  it  is  up 
to  you,  gentlemen,  to  keep  your  eyes  peeled.” 

Louis  XIII,  on  his  deathbed,  recommended  Rossignol  to  his  queen  as  one 
of  the  men  most  necessary  to  the  good  of  the  state.  Two  years  later,  on 
February  18,  1645,  Richelieu’s  successor,  Cardinal  Mazarin,  named  him  a 
master  of  the  Chamber  of  Accounts  and  a counselor  of  state.  Like  Richelieu, 
Mazarin  himself  sometimes  sent  him  intercepts.  In  1656,  for  example,  he 
forwarded  a letter  of  the  Cardinal  de  Retz  instructing  Rossignol  to  solve  it. 
Under  Louis  XIV,  Rossignol  often  worked  in  a room  next  to  the  king’s 
study  at  Versailles.  From  here  issued  the  streams  of  solutions  that  helped  the 
Sun  King  direct  the  polity  of  France. 

Rossignol  had,  at  45,  improved  his  social  position  by  marrying  23-year- 
old  Catherine  Quentin,  the  daughter  of  a nobleman  and  the  niece  of  a bishop. 
Their  marriage  was  a happy  one,  full  of  playfulness  and  endearments,  and 
they  had  two  children,  Bonaventure  and  Marie. 

One  of  their  best  friends  was  the  poet  Boisrobert,  who  originated  the  idea 
of  the  Academie  Frangaise.  He  loved  to  hold  forth  at  the  excellent  Rossignol 
table,  which  he  liked  for  its  fine  wines  and  Madame  Rossignol’s  charm  as  a 
hostess.  (In  a 13-line  poem  to  her,  he  declared  her  friendship  “sweeter  than 
sugar  with  cream.”)  When  he  found  himself  out  of  favor  at  court,  he  com- 
plained about  his  unhappiness  in  a poem  to  his  influential  cryptologist-friend.

Rossignol  showed  it  to  Mazarin,  who  singled  out  Boisrobert  at  the  next 
audience  and  praised  the  poem  loudly.  Boisrobert,  delighted  at  this  sign  of 
favor,  addressed  a paean  of  thanks  to  Rossignol.  Perhaps  out  of  gratitude,  he 
later  praised  him  extravagantly  in  the  first  poem  ever  written  to  a cryptologist.

Rossignol’s  work  gave  him  access  to  some  of  the  greatest  secrets  of  the 
state  and  the  court,  and  consequently  made  him  a figure  of  some  prominence 
in  the  glittering  court  of  Louis  XIV.  He  appears  in  some  of  the  major 
memoirs  of  that  period.  Tallement  des  Reaux  tells  some  unflattering  stories 
about  him  and  calls  him  “a  poor  species  of  man”  in  his  Historiettes.  But  the 
Duke  of  Saint-Simon,  whose  Memoires  are  a monument  of  French  literature, 
wrote  that  Rossignol  was  “the  most  skillful  decipherer  of  Europe.  ...  No 
cipher  escaped  him;  there  were  many  which  he  read  right  away.  This  gave 
him  many  intimacies  with  the  king,  and  made  him  an  important  man.” 
Rossignol  also  became  the  first  person  to  have  his  biography  written  solely 
because  of  his  cryptologic  abilities.  Charles  Perrault,  who  is  better  known  as 
the  formulator  of  the  Mother  Goose  tales,  included  a two-page  sketch  of 
Rossignol's  life,  complete  with  engraved  portrait,  in  his  “Illustrious  Men  Who 
Have  Appeared  in  France  During  This  Century,”  in  the  company  of  such  as

160  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Richelieu.  Mazarin  regarded  his  good  will  as  important  enough  to  write  a 
letter  of  regret  in  1658  for  some  injury  done  to  Rossignol  at  Paris — and  to 
follow  it  up  two  months  later  with  a note  to  a court  official  pressing  him  to 
do  justice  to  the  cryptanalyst  “for  the  insult  and  violence  that  has  been  done 
him."  A more  particular  sign  of  importance  appears  in  the  largesse  that  the 
king  showered  upon  him:  14,000  ecus  in  1653,  150,000  livres  in  1672,  and 
an  annuity,  late  in  his  life,  of  12,000 — to  name  just  some  of  his  payments.* 

All  the  power,  wealth,  flattery,  and  royal  favor  that  came  to  Rossignol  at 
court  quite  turned  his  small-town  head.  To  pace  the  galleries  of  the  Louvre 
with  haughty  dukes  and  princes  of  France,  to  wear  rich  lace-trimmed  coats 
with  enormous  cuffs,  and  stockings  of  whitest  silk,  to  play  at  that  new  game, 
billiards,  with  the  king  himself — and  to  have  this  publicized  in  an  engraving — 
to  run  up  bills  at  the  wigmaker’s,  to  learn  before  the  rest  of  the  world  did 
who  had  become  the  king’s  new  mistress,  best  of  all,  to  return  home  to  Albi 
exuding  the  aura  of  the  court.  “Monseigneur,”  he  gloated  one  day  to 
Richelieu  about  his  former  neighbors,  “they  do  not  dare  to  approach  me. 
They  regard  me  as  a favorite— me,  who  lives  with  them  just  as  before.  They 
are  amazed  at  my  civility.”  Richelieu  could  only  shrug  his  shoulders. 

Nevertheless,  Rossignol’s  abilities  were  undeniable.  And  they  served 
France  not  only  in  cryptanalysis  but  in  cryptography,  where  they  wrought 
the  most  important  technical  improvement  that  nomenclators  underwent  in 
their  400-year  reign. 

When  Rossignol  began  his  career,  nomenclators  listed  both  their  plain 
and  code  elements  in  alphabetical  order  (or  alphabetical  and  numerical  order, 
if  the  code  was  numerical).  Plain  and  code  paralleled  one  another.  This 
relatively  simple  arrangement  had  existed  since  nomenclators  emerged  during 
the  early  Renaissance.  The  only  deviation  occurred  in  occasional  small 
nomenclators  when  short  lists  of  names  were  written  down  haphazardly;  the 
code  elements,  however,  always  ascended  in  alphabetical  order.  Rossignol 
must  have  soon  observed  in  his  cryptanalyses  that  parallelism  of  plain  and 
code  assisted  him  in  recovering  plaintext.  If,  for  example,  he  ascertained  in  an 
English  dispatch  that  137  stood  for  for  and  168  for  in,  he  would  know  that  21 
could  not  represent  to  because  codenumbers  for  words  beginning  with  t 
would  have  to  stand  higher  than  those  for  words  beginning  with  i.  Moreover, 
he  would  know  that  the  codenumber  for  from,  which  comes  alphabetically 
between  for  and  in,  would  have  to  fall  between  their  codenumbers  137  and 
168,  and  he  could  search  accordingly. 

* One  story  about  Rossignol  should  be  deflated,  however.  This  is  that  his  solutions  were 
made  “in  a fashion  so  marvelous  to  his  contemporaries  that  the  device  with  which  a lock  is 
opened  when  the  key  has  been  lost  is  still  called  in  French  a rossignol"  While  the  fact  of  the 
current  usage  is  true,  its  implied  origin  is  false.  Unfortunately  for  so  charming  an  etymology, 
this  particular  use  of  the  term  rossignol  appears  as  criminal  argot  in  police  documents  as 
early  as  1406 — almost  two  centuries  before  the  cryptologist  was  born.  Since  the  word  also 
means  “nightingale,”  it  may  be  possible  that  the  thieves  adopted  it  as  slang  for  a picklock 
because  its  nighttime  solos  of  clicks  and  rasps  were  music  to  their  ears. 


161 


The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

From  here,  it  was  a simple  step  to  depriving  other  cryptanalysts  of  such 
clues  by  destroying  the  parallel  arrangement.  This  he  did,  mixing  the  code 
elements  relative  to  the  plain.  Two  lists  were  now  required,  one  in  which  the 
plain  elements  were  in  alphabetical  order  and  the  code  elements  randomized, 
and  one  to  facilitate  decoding  in  which  the  code  elements  stood  in  alphabetical 
or  numerical  order  while  their  plain  equivalents  were  disarranged.  These  two 
lists  soon  came  to  be  called  “tables  a chiffrer”  and  “tables  a dechiffrer,”  and 
the  mixed  type  of  nomenclator  became  a “two-part”  nomenclator  to  contrast 
it  with  the  older  “one-part”  type.  The  two-part  nomenclator  has  been 
compared  to  a bilingual  dictionary.  In  the  first  half,  the  native  words  are 
listed  alphabetically  and  the  foreign  appear  in  mixed  order;  in  the  second 
half,  the  foreign  words  progress  alphabetically  and  the  native  words  are 
jumbled. 

This  innovation  apparently  began  to  go  into  service  about  the  middle  of 
Rossignol’s  stewardship.  Circumstances  probably  deserve  most  of  the  credit 
for  his  getting  the  idea  first.  At  that  time,  other  countries  employed  different 
people  for  making  nomenclators  and  for  breaking  them.  The  cryptanalysts 
were  called  in  only  when  needed;  clerks  compiled  the  nomenclators.  France 
alone  was  rich  and  active  enough  to  need  and  support  a full-time  cryptanalyst, 
who  could  also  apply  his  knowledge  to  improving  France’s  secret  com- 
munications. 

The  two-part  construction  spread  rapidly  to  other  countries.  At  the  same 
time,  nomenclators  continued  to  grow.  The  greater  the  size  the  greater  the 
security,  for  it  meant  just  that  many  more  elements  that  the  cryptanalyst  had 
to  recover.  By  the  1700s  some  nomenclators  ran  to  2,000  or  3,000  elements. 
But  these  were  very  expensive  to  compile  in  two-part  form,  and  so,  for 
reasons  of  economy  and  to  the  detriment  of  security,  some  nomenclators 
regressed  to  a modified  two-part  form.  The  code  elements  paralleled  the  plain 
in  segments  of  a few  dozen  groups,  but  the  segments  themselves  were  in 
mixed  order.  For  example,  a Spanish  nomenclator,  a cifra  general  of  1677, 
has  the  syllables  from  bal  to  b!e  represented  by  the  numbers  from  131  to  149, 
but  bli,  following  ble,  is  encoded  by  322.  This  series  continues  to  Bigueras  at 
343,  while  150  reappears  farther  down  the  list  as  the  codegroup  for  c. 

As  he  grew  old,  Rossignol  retired  to  his  country  home  at  Juvisy  though 
he  reportedly  continued  to  perform  his  special  magic  to  the  end  of  his  life. 
His  last  days  were  brightened  by  an  unmistakable  demonstration  of  royal 
esteem:  the  Sun  King  made  a detour  in  a progress  back  to  Fontainebleau  to 
visit  him  at  Juvisy — this  in  an  age  when  courtiers  vied  for  the  privilege  of 
removing  the  king’s  pajamas  at  grand  and  petit  levees  each  morning!  Rossig- 
nol died  soon  after,  in  December  of  1682,  only  a few  days  short  of  his  83rd 
birthday  on  January  1. 

He  had  been  the  cryptologist  of  France  in  that  incomparable  moment 
when  Moliere  was  her  dramatist,  Pascal  her  philosopher,  La  Fontaine  her 
fabulist,  and  the  supreme  autocrat  of  the  world  her  monarch.  Rossignol  was, 


162  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

like  them,  a superlative  practitioner  of  his  art  at  the  foremost  court  of  Europe 
in  the  very  splendor  of  its  golden  age. 

His  work  was  carried  on  by  his  son,  whom  he  had  tutored.  Bona  venture 
succeeded  to  his  father’s  12,000  livres  a year,  and  in  1688  was  raised  from 
counselor  to  the  parlement  to  president  of  the  Chamber  of  Accounts.  A 
contemporary  describes  him  as  an  “intriguer,  very  ugly,  who  has  gained  great 
well-being  from  deciphering  letters.”  He  numbered  among  his  friends  the 
great  letter  writer,  Madame  de  Sevigne.  When  he  died,  in  1705,  the  Marquis 
de  Dangeau  remarked  in  his  Memoires  that  he  was  the  finest  decipherer  in 
Europe.  The  Mercure  Galant  likewise  praised  him,  saying  that  “the  King 
himself  admitted  being  vexed  by  his  death:  which  alone  may  suffice  for  his 
eulogy.”  Saint-Simon  would  only  concede  that  “he  became  adept  at  it,  but 
not  to  the  point  of  his  father.  They  were,”  he  summed  up,  “honest  and  un- 
assuming men,  who  both  waxed  fat  on  the  king,  who  even  left  a pension  of 
5,000  livres  for  those  members  of  the  family  who  were  not  old  enough  to 
decipher.”  Bonaventure’s  eldest  son  had  been  killed  in  an  accident,  and  his 
second  son,  Antoine-Bonaventure,  who  had  been  destined  for  a career  in  the 
church,  switched  to  what  had  become  the  family  trade.  He  inherited  the 
Rossignol  acuity  in  cryptanalysis,  and  eventually  succeeded  his  father  as 
president  of  the  Chamber  of  Accounts. 

One  of  the  most  important  contributions  of  the  Rossignols  was  to  make 
crystal  clear  to  the  rulers  of  France  the  importance  of  cryptanalyzed  dis- 
patches in  framing  their  policy.  So  effectively  did  their  work  demonstrate  this 
that  the  war  minister,  Louvois,  vigorously  encouraged  anyone  who  could 
provide  such  intelligence.  On  July  2,  1673,  while  Antoine  Rossignol  was  still 
alive,  Louvois  ordered  200  ecus  remitted  to  one  Vimbois  “for  having  found  the 
cipher,”  and,  four  days  later,  600  livres  to  one  Sieur  de  La  Tixeraudiere  for  his 
solution.  The  next  year,  he  thanked  the  Count  of  Nancre  at  the  Flanders 
frontier  for  sending  him  an  enemy  cipher  table,  saying  “that  if  the  man  of 
whom  you  speak  can  help  you  succeed  [in  solving  some  enciphered  letters], 
you  may  assure  him  that  His  Majesty  will  grant  him  what  he  asks.”  Still 
another  of  Louvois’  cryptanalysts  was  named  Luillier.  All  these  endeavors 
coalesced  into  a central  black  chamber,  or  Cabinet  Noir,  which  regularly  read 
the  ciphered  dispatches  of  foreign  diplomats  throughout  the  1700s. 

These  successes  quickened  the  French  appreciation  of  the  need  to  prevent 
cryptanalysis  of  their  own  systems.  Their  precautionary  measures  included 
frequent  changes  and  an  ironclad  control.  In  1676,  Louvois  sent  a dozen  two- 
part  nomenclators  to  the  provincial  governors,  and  a few  months  later 
followed  them  up  with  a detailed  order  of  the  king  about  how  they  were 
each  to  be  placed  into  individual  packets  and  carefully  marked.  In  1690,  when 
Louis  XIV  again  ordered  a change  in  the  chiffre  general,  Louvois  instructed 
the  governors  to  return  the  old  tables  and  reminded  them  to  use  the  homo- 
phones in  the  new  nomenclator  and  not  always  to  repeat  the  same  cipher 


163 


The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

character.  And  in  1711,  Louis,  though  a crabbed  and  tired  old  man  then  only 
four  years  from  his  grave,  was  ordering  still  another  set  of  nomenclators  sent 
to  these  governors.  Extant  records  of  the  ministry  of  war  for  the  reign  of  his 
successor,  Louis  XV,  comprehend  nomenclator  after  nomenclator,  all  of 
several  hundred  number  groups  in  thoroughly  disarranged  fashion,  for  use 
with  various  individuals.  One  of  several  special  “Canada  Tables”  was  for  the 
Marquis  de  Montcalm;  it  is  dated  1755,  just  before  that  general  sailed  to 
defend  New  France  against  the  British  and  to  die  a hero’s  death  in  battle  with 
Wolfe  on  the  Plains  of  Abraham.  In  the  repertory  of  a 1756  nomenclator, 
destined  for  France’s  colonial  efforts  in  Asia,  the  proper  names  of  the  East 
glow  like  rubies:  the  Mogul,  the  Nabob,  Pondichery,  India  itself.  A note  on 
another  nomenclator,  intended  for  use  among  ten  persons,  demonstrates  the 
care  with  which  they  were  used:  “Suppressed,”  reads  the  notation,  "M.  de 
Marainville  having  lost  his.” 

The  prudence  was  not  excessive.  One  day  near  the  end  of  Louis  XV’s 
reign  in  1774,  a marshal  of  France  brought  a package  from  Vienna  into  the 
king’s  presence.  When  Louis  undid  it,  he  was  astonished  to  see  not  only 
dispatches  of  the  king  of  Prussia  to  secret  agents  in  Paris  and  Vienna,  but  also 
plaintext  copies  of  his  own  most  secret  enciphered  correspondence,  and 
messages  between  the  head  of  his  spy  organization  and  his  ambassador  in 
Stockholm,  who  participated  in  the  coup  that  set  up  the  strongly  pro-French 
Gustavus  III  as  absolute  monarch  of  Sweden.  Louis  was  told  that  the  package 
had  come  from  the  Abbot  Georgel,  secretary  to  France  s ambassador  to 
Austria.  Georgel  had  met  a masked  man  at  midnight  in  Vienna  and  had  been 
given  the  packet  in  return  for  1,000  ducats.  When  he  opened  it  in  his  room,  he 
found  that  he  could  obtain  twice  weekly  all  the  discoveries  of  the  black 
chamber  of  Vienna,  in  which  the  correspondence  of  all  powers  was  surrepti- 
tiously opened,  solved,  and  read.  Georgel  made  the  deal,  and  continued  to 
meet  the  mysterious  agent  at  midnight,  sending  the  documents  to  Louis  twice 
a week  by  special  courier. 

Black  chambers  were  common  during  the  1700s,  but  that  of  Vienna 
the  Geheime  Kabinets-Kanzlei— was  reputed  to  be  the  best  in  all  Europe. 

It  ran  with  almost  unbelievable  efficiency.  The  bags  of  mail  for  delivery 
that  morning  to  the  embassies  in  Vienna  were  brought  to  the  black  chamber 
each  day  at  7 a.m.  There  the  letters  were  opened  by  melting  their  seals  with  a 
candle.  The  order  of  the  letters  in  an  envelope  was  noted  and  the  letters  given 
to  a subdirector.  He  read  them  and  ordered  the  important  parts  copied.  All 
the  employees  could  write  rapidly,  and  some  knew  shorthand.  Long  letters 
were  dictated  to  save  time,  sometimes  using  four  stenographers  to  a single 
letter.  If  a letter  was  in  a language  that  he  did  not  know,  the  subdirector  gave 
it  to  a cabinet  employee  familiar  with  it.  Two  translators  were  always  on 
hand.  All  European  languages  could  be  read,  and  when  a new  one  was  needed, 
an  official  learned  it.  Armenian,  for  example,  took  one  cabinet  polyglot  only 


164 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


a few  months  to  learn,  and  he  was  paid  the  usual  500  florins  for  his  new 
knowledge.  After  copying,  the  letters  were  replaced  in  their  envelopes  in  their 
original  order  and  the  envelopes  resealed,  using  forged  seals  to  impress 
the  original  wax.  The  letters  were  returned  to  the  post  office  by  9:30  a.m. 

At  10  a.m.,  the  mail  that  was  passing  through  this  crossroads  of  the 
continent  arrived  and  was  handled  in  the  same  way,  though  with  less  hurry 
because  it  was  in  transit.  Usually  it  would  be  back  in  the  post  by  2 p.m., 
though  sometimes  it  was  kept  as  late  as  7 p.m.  At  1 1 a.m.,  interceptions  made 
by  the  police  for  purposes  of  political  surveillance  arrived.  And  at  4 p.m.,  the 
couriers  brought  the  letters  that  the  embassies  were  sending  out  that  day. 
These  were  back  in  the  stream  of  communications  by  6:30  p.m.  Copied 
material  was  handed  to  the  director  of  the  cabinet,  who  excerpted  information 
of  special  interest  and  routed  it  to  the  proper  agencies,  as  police,  army,  or 
railway  administration,  and  sent  the  mass  of  diplomatic  material  to  the  court. 
All  told,  the  ten-man  cabinet  handled  an  average  of  between  80  and  100 
letters  a day. 

Astonishingly,  their  nimble  fingers  hardly  ever  stuffed  letters  into  the 
wrong  packet,  despite  the  speed  with  which  they  worked.  In  one  of  the  few 
recorded  blunders,  an  intercepted  letter  to  the  Duke  of  Modena  was  errone- 
ously resealed  with  the  closely  similar  signet  of  Parma.  When  the  duke 
noticed  the  substitution,  he  sent  it  to  Parma  with  the  wry  note,  “Not  just  me — 
you  too.”  Both  states  protested,  but  the  Viennese  greeted  them  with  a blank 
stare,  a shrug,  and  a bland  profession  of  ignorance.  Despite  this,  the  existence 
of  the  black  chamber  was  well  known  to  the  various  delegates  to  the  Austrian 
court,  and  was  even  tacitly  acknowledged  by  the  Austrians.  When  the  British 
ambassador  complained  humorously  that  he  was  getting  copies  instead  of  his 
original  correspondence,  the  chancellor  replied  coolly,  “How  clumsy  these 
people  are!” 

Enciphered  correspondence  was  subjected  to  the  usual  cryptanalytic 
sweating  process.  The  Viennese  enjoyed  remarkable  success  in  this  work.  The 
French  ambassador,  who  was  apprised  of  its  successes  through  Georgel's 
purchases  from  the  masked  man,  remarked  in  astonishment  that  “our  ciphers 
of  1200  [groups]  hold  out  only  a little  while  against  the  ability  of  the  Austrian 
decipherers.”  He  added  that  though  he  suggested  new  ways  of  ciphering 
and  continual  changes  of  ciphers,  “I  still  find  myself  without  secure  means 
for  the  secrets  I have  to  transmit  to  Constantinople,  Stockholm,  and  St. 
Petersburg.” 

The  Viennese  owed  at  least  some  of  their  success  to  their  progressive 
personnel  policies.  Except  in  emergencies,  the  cryptanalysts  worked  one  week 
and  took  off  one  week — apparently  to  keep  them  from  cracking  under  the 
intense  mental  strain  of  the  work.  Though  the  pay  was  not  high,  substantial 
bonuses  were  given  for  solutions.  For  example,  bonuses  totalling  3,730  florins 
were  disbursed  between  March  1,  1780,  and  March  31,  1781,  for  the  solution 
of  15  important  keys.  Perhaps  the  most  important  incentive  was  the  prestige 


165 


The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

accorded  to  the  cryptanalysts  by  direct  royal  recognition  of  their  value.  Karl 
VI  personally  handed  the  cryptanalysts  their  bonuses  and  thanked  them  for 
their  work.  Empress  Maria  Theresa  conferred  frequently  with  the  officials  of 
the  black  chamber  about  the  cipher  service  and  the  cryptanalytic  ability  of 
other  countries;  that  remarkable  woman  demonstrated  her  grasp  of  the 
principles  involved  by  inquiring  whether  any  of  her  ambassadors  had  cor- 
responded too  much  in  a single  nomenclator  and  ought  to  be  given  a new  key. 
The  cryptanalysts  sometimes  even  got  paid  for  not  solving  a cipher:  if  a key 
was  stolen  from  an  embassy,  the  codebreakers  would  get  a kind  of  unemploy- 
ment compensation  because  they  had  no  opportunity  to  win  their  bonus.  In 
1833,  for  example,  the  cabinet  got  three  fifths  of  the  solution  bonus  when  the 
key  of  the  French  envoy  was  stealthily  removed,  copied,  and  replaced  in  a 
cupboard  in  the  bedroom  of  the  secretary  of  the  French  legation  within  a 
single  night. 

The  cryptanalysts’  training  likewise  aimed  at  stimulating  extra  effort. 
Young  men  about  20,  of  high  moral  caliber,  who  spoke  French  and  Italian 
fluently  and  knew  some  algebra  and  elementary  mathematics,  were  assigned 
to  cryptanalysts  as  trainees.  They  were  kept  ignorant  of  the  real  work  going 
on  while  they  learned  to  construct  keys,  and  then  tested  as  to  whether  they 
could  break  the  systems  they  had  constructed.  If  they  failed,  they  were  trans- 
ferred to  another  civil  service  job.  If  they  proved  competent,  they  were  intro- 
duced to  the  secrets  of  the  black  chamber  and  sent  to  other  countries  for 
linguistic  training.  The  starting  salary  was  400  florins  a year,  and  this  was 
doubled  when  they  solved  their  first  cipher.  Their  instructors  were  paid  extra 
for  the  tutelage.  Since  all  directors  had  to  be  cryptanalysts,  this  was  the  way 
for  a young  man  to  become  director  of  the  black  chamber — a high-status  post 
which  paid  salaries  varying  between  the  extraordinarily  good  rates  of  4,000 
and  8,000  florins,  which  often  brought  awards  of  such  medals  as  the  Order  of 
St.  Stephan,  and  which  gave  direct  and  frequent  access  to  the  monarch,  with 
all  that  that  privilege  implied. 

A good  glimpse  into  the  achievements  of  the  Geheime  Kabinets-Kanzlei 
is  afforded  by  the  letters  of  one  of  its  best  directors,  Baron  Ignaz  de  Koch, 
who  served  from  1749  to  1763  with  the  cover-title  of  secretary  to  Maria 
Theresa.  On  September  4,  1751,  he  sent  to  the  Austrian  ambassador  in 
France  some  cryptanalyzed  correspondence  which  “makes  one  see  more  and 
more  the  main  principles  that  direct  the  cabinet  in  France.”  Two  weeks  later, 
in  referring  to  some  other  cryptanalyses,  he  wrote,  “This  is  the  eighteenth 
cipher  that  we  have  got  through  during  the  course  of  the  year; ...  we  are 
regarded,  unhappily,  as  being  too  able  in  this  art,  and  this  thought  makes  the 
courts  that  fear  that  we  can  engross  their  correspondence  change  their  keys 
at  every  instant,  so  to  speak,  each  time  sending  ones  more  difficult  and  more 
laborious  to  decipher.”  Among  letters  solved  during  its  existence  were  those 
of  Napoleon,  Talleyrand,  and  a host  of  lesser  diplomats.  These  solutions  were 
often  made  the  basis  of  Austrian  strategy.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


England,  too,  had  its  black  chamber.  Its  origins  may  be  found  in  the 
cryptanalyses  of  a young  man  who  stumbled  into  cryptology  at  the  same  age 
and  at  about  the  same  time  that  Rossignol  did,  and  who  may  be  considered 
his  counterpart.  This  was  John  Wallis,  better  known  as  the  greatest  English 
mathematician  before  Newton. 

He  was  born  on  November  23,  1616,  in  Ashford,  Kent,  where  his  father 
was  rector.  He  studied  at  Emanuel  College,  Cambridge,  became  a fellow  of 
Queen’s  College  there,  and  was  ordained  a minister.  He  was  known  to  divert 
himself  with  arithmetical  problems,  and  one  evening  early  in  1643,  when  he 
was  serving  as  chaplain  to  the  widowed  Lady  Vere,  a gentleman  brought  him 
a letter  that  had  been  found  after  the  capture  of  Chichester  by  a parliamentary 
army  during  the  Puritan  Revolution.  Wallis  told  him  that  he  could  not  tell 
whether  he  could  solve  it  or  not,  “Adding  withall,  that  if  it  were  nothing  but 
barely  a new  Alphabet,  as  at  the  first  Sight  it  seemed  to  bee,  I thought  it 
might  possibly  bee  done.  The  Gentleman,”  Wallis  wrote  afterward,  “who  did 
not  expect  such  an  answer,  told  mee  Hee  would  leave  it  with  all  his  Heart,  if 
I had  any  Thought  of  reading  it:  And  accordingly  did  so.  After  Supper  (for  it 
was  somewhat  late  in  the  Evening  when  1 first  saw  it)  having  a while  considered 
what  Course  to  take,  I set  about  it,  and  within  a few  Houres  (before  I slept) 
I had  overcome  the  Difficulty,  and  transcribed  the  Letter  in  a legible  Char- 
acter. This  good  Successe  upon  an  easy  Cipher  (for  so  it  was)  made  me 
confident,  that  I might  with  the  like  ease  read  any  other,  which  was  no  more 
intricate  than  that.” 

But  the  next  one,  a numerical,  was  so  much  more  difficult  than  the  first, 
which  was  a long  monalphabetic  with  word  divisions,  that  Wallis  turned  it 
down.  His  career  would  have  been  nipped  before  it  had  budded — except  that, 
soon  thereafter,  Wallis  was  somehow  prevailed  upon  to  try  a cryptogram  that 
had  lain  about  for  two  years  because  no  one  could  be  found  to  solve  it.  The 
cipher  numbers  in  this  letter  ranged  beyond  700,  and,  wrote  Wallis,  as  the 
first  cryptogram  “was  one  of  the  easiest,  so  this  second  was  one  of  the  hardest 
that  I have  ever  met  with.”  Several  times  he  gave  it  up  as  “desperate,”  but 
after  about  three  months,  “I  did  at  last  overcome  the  Difficulty.” 

This  feat  made  his  fortune.  At  the  behest  of  Parliament,  he  solved  in  1643 
some  of  the  dispatches  of  Charles  I during  the  civil  war,  and  was  rewarded, 
first,  with  the  living  of  St.  Gabriel’s  Church  in  London,  and  then  with  the 
place  of  secretary  to  the  Westminster  Assembly.  Additional  solutions  for 
Parliament  led  to  his  appointment  in  1649  as  Savilian  professor  of  geometry 
at  Oxford  at  the  age  of  32.  In  1660,  Charles  IPs  negotiations  with  Presby- 
terian ministers  in  London  for  his  Restoration  were  “made  known  to  mee,” 
said  Thomas  Scot,  director  of  intelligence  for  Parliament,  “first  by  one  Mr 
Harvy,  since  dead  and  after  by  Major  Adams,  who  kept  them  daily  Company 
here,  but  very  much  more  by  letters  intercepted  which  commonly  were  every 
word  & syllable  in  Cypher,  and  decyphered  by  a learned  gentleman  incom- 
parably able  that  way,  Dor  Wallis  of  Oxford  (who  never  concerned  himself  in 


167 


The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

the  matter,  but  only  in  ye  art  & ingenuity) ; it  is  a jewell  for  a Princes  vse  and 
service  in  that  kind.”  Though  Charles  knew  of  Wallis’  parliamentary  services 
through  Scot’s  confession,  he  found  him  so  valuable  that  soon  after  he 
ascended  the  throne  he  was  employing  the  man  who  had  recently  worked 
against  him.  Indeed,  so  indispensable  did  Wallis  prove  that  Charles  com- 
pensated him  not  only  with  small  sums  of  bounty  but  eventually  with  an 
appointment  as  a chaplain  to  the  king. 

Wallis  seems  to  have  been  largely  self-taught.  He  studied  the  works  of 
Porta  and  others,  but  learned  little  from  them  because,  he  says,  they  chiefly 
treated  of  methods  of  encipherment.  “So  that  I saw,  there  was  little  Help  to 
bee  expected  from  others;  but  that  if  1 should  have  further  occasions  of  that 
Kind,  I must  trust  to  my  owne  Industry  and  such  observations  as  the  present 
Case  should  afford.  And  indeed,”  he  continues  perceptively,  “the  Nature  of 
the  Thing  is  scarce  capable  of  any  other  Directions ; every  new  Cipher  allmost 
being  contrived  in  a new  Way,  which  doth  not  admit  any  constant  Method  for 
the  finding  of  it  out.” 

The  mind  that,  without  aid,  could  find  its  way  so  unerringly  through  the 
labyrinth  of  cryptology  could  also  blaze  new  trails  in  the  unexplored  fields  of 
mathematics.  This  Wallis  did.  His  Arithmetica  Infinitorum  arrived  at  results 
that  Newton  used  as  a springboard  to  develop  the  calculus  and  that  contained 
the  germ  of  the  binomial  theorem.  Wallis  invented  the  symbol  co  for  infinity, 
and  he  was  the  first  to  give  the  value  of  n by  interpolation — a term,  incident- 
ally, that  he  coined.  In  later  years,  he  taught  himself  to  calculate  mentally  to 
while  away  sleepless  nights,  performing  such  astounding  feats  as  extracting 
the  square  root  of  a number  of  53  digits  and  dictating  the  answer  (which 
proved  correct)  to  27  places. 

Hale  and  vigorous  of  body,  of  medium  height  with  a small  head,  he  was 
set  down  by  that  vivid  chronicler  John  Aubrey  as  a person  of  reall  worth 
who  “may  stand  very  gloriously  upon  his  owne  basis,  and  need  not  be  be- 
holding to  any  man  for  Fame,  yet  he  is  so  extremely  greedy  of  glorie,  that  he 
steales  feathers  from  others  to  adorne  his  own  cap;  e.g.,  he  lies  at  watch  at 
Sir  Christopher  Wren’s  discourses,  Mr.  Robert  Hooke’s,  Dr.  William  Holder, 
&c;  putts  downe  their  notions  in  his  Note  booke,  and  then  prints  it,  without 
owneing  the  author.  This  frequently,  of  which  they  complain.”  Wallis  helped 
found  the  Royal  Society,  but  despite  his  accomplishments,  Samuel  Pepys,  who 
met  him  on  December  16,  1665/6,  noted  in  his  diary,  Here  was  also  Dr. 
Wallis,  the  famous  scholar  and  mathematician;  but  he  promises  little." 

Wallis’  most  active  period,  cryptologically,  came  late  in  life,  when  he  was 
employed  as  cryptanalyst  to  William  and  Mary.  In  1689,  he  reported  to 
William’s  Secretary  for  War,  the  Earl  of  Nottingham,  that  in  the  past  two 
weeks  he  had  forwarded  three  packets  of  solutions  and  now  had  lying  before 
him  five  letters  in  three  or  four  different  ciphers,  all  new  to  him.  He  told 
Nottingham,  who  was  always  pressing  him  for  solutions,  that  he  could  not 
yet  give  the  plaintext  of  some  cryptograms,  though,  he  went  on,  “I  have 


168 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


already  employed  about  seven  weeks  on  them,  and  have  studied  hard  there- 
upon eight  or  ten  hours  in  a day,  or  more  than  so  very  often,  which,  in  a 
business  of  this  nature,  is  hard  service  for  one  of  my  years  [then  more  than  70] 
unless  I would  crack  my  brains  at  it.”  Nottingham,  in  fact,  was  once  so 
anxious  to  have  a solution  to  letters  from  Louvois  to  one  of  his  generals  that 
he  told  Wallis  that  he  had  ordered  the  messenger  who  brought  the  crypto- 
grams to  wait  until  Wallis  had  solved  them.  Wallis  managed  to  break  the 
nomenclator  in  four  days  and,  on  returning  the  plaintext,  tactfully  apprised 
Nottingham  of  a few  cryptologic  realities  to  explain  why  he  had  let  the 
messenger  go.

John  Wallis'  solution  of  a dispatch  of  Louis  XIV  of  France  of  June  9,  1693 

His  solutions — nearly  all  nomenclators,  a few  monalphabetics — had  a 
considerable  impact  on  current  events.  In  the  summer  of  1689,  he  solved  the 
correspondence  between  Louis  XIV  and  his  ambassador  in  Poland.  In  one 
dispatch,  Louis  was  caught  urging  the  King  of  Poland  to  declare  war  against 
Prussia  with  him;  in  another,  he  was  discovered  promoting  a self-serving 
marriage  between  the  Prince  of  Poland  and  the  Princess  of  Hanover.  Wallis 
described  the  value  of  this  work  in  a letter  asking  for  a raise:  “The  deciphering 
of  some  of  those  letters  having  quite  broke  all  ye  French  King’s  measures  in 
Poland  for  that  time;  & caused  his  Ambassadors  to  be  thence  thrust  out  with 
disgrace.  Which  one  thing,”  he  adds  pointedly,  “was  of  much  greater  advan- 
tage to  his  Malie  & his  Allies,  than  all  that  I am  like  to  receive  on  that 
account.” 

Though  Wallis  entreated  Nottingham  not  to  publicize  his  solutions  for 
fear  France  would  again  change  her  ciphers,  as  she  had  done  nine  or  ten  times 
before  (probably  under  the  expert  Rossignol  tutelage),  word  of  his  prowess 
somehow  spread.  The  King  of  Prussia  gave  him  a gold  chain  for  solving  a

77ie  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

cryptogram,  and  the  Elector  of  Brandenburg  a medal  for  reading  200  or  300 
sheets  of  cipher.  The  Elector  of  Hanover,  not  wanting  to  depend  on  a foreign 
cryptanalyst,  got  Wallis’  fellow  intellectual,  Baron  Gottfried  von  Leibnitz, 
to  importune  him  with  lucrative  offers  to  instruct  several  young  men  in  the 
art.  When  Wallis  put  off  Leibnitz’  query  as  to  how  he  did  these  amazing 
things  by  saying  that  there  was  no  fixed  method,  Leibnitz  quickly  acknow- 
ledged it  and,  hinting  that  Wallis  and  the  art  might  die  together,  pressed  his 
request  that  he  instruct  some  younger  people  in  it.  Wallis  finally  had  to  say 
bluntly  that  he  would  be  glad  to  serve  the  elector  if  need  be,  but  he  could  not 
send  his  skill  abroad  without  the  king’s  leave. 

The  shrewd  old  cryptanalyst,  who  was  frequently  asking  for  more  money 
for  his  solutions,  then  used  Leibnitz’  arguments  to  his  own  advantage  in 
successfully  urging  the  secretaries  of  state  to  pay  for  his  tutoring  of  his 
grandson  in  cryptanalysis.  They  agreed  in  1699,  but  it  was  not  until  Wallis 
wrote  to  the  king  in  1701,  saying  that  the  young  man  had  made  such  good 
progress  that  he  had  solved  one  of  the  best  English  ciphers  and  a very  good 
French  one,  that  they  were  jointly  granted  £100  a year,  retroactive  to  1699. 

Wallis’  career  thus  strikingly  parallels  Rossignol’s.  The  two  men  were 
approximately  contemporaneous  (Rossignol  was  not  quite  17  years  older). 
Both  made  their  first  cryptanalyses  in  their  late  twenties  on  ciphers  stemming 
from  civil  warfare  in  their  countries.  Both  had  a mathematical  bent,  and  both 
were  largely  self-taught  in  cryptology.  Both  owed  their  worldly  success  to  this 
unusual  talent.  Both  lived  into  their  eighties.  And  both  became  their  countries’ 
Fathers  of  Cryptology  in  a literal  as  well  as  a figurative  sense.  There  were 
differences,  of  course.  Rossignol  had  to  assist  at  the  more  autocratic  French 
court;  Wallis  seems  to  have  done  most  of  his  work  at  Oxford  and  in  other 
country  places  far  from  London.  Rossignol  probably  supervised  French 
cryptography,  but  Wallis  apparently  prescribed  an  English  cipher  only  once, 
and  that  very  informally.  It  is  therefore  unlikely  that  these  cryptologic 
titans  of  the  two  most  powerful  and  most  contentious  countries  of  Europe 
ever  clashed  cryptologically.  Thus  the  problem  as  to  who  might  have  been  the 
better  must  remain — unlike  the  cryptograms  to  which  they  addressed  them- 
selves with  such  success — forever  unsolved. 

On  Wallis’  death  on  October  28,  1703,  the  grandson  whom  he  had  tutored, 
William  Blencowe,  an  undergraduate  at  Magdalen  College,  assumed  the 
cryptanalytical  duties,  though  he  was  only  20  years  old.  His  grandfather  s 
tutorial  fee  of  £100  reverted  to  him  as  Decypherer,  and  he  thus  became  the 
first  Englishman  both  to  bear  that  title  officially  and  to  be  paid  a regular 
salary  for  cryptanalysis.  Blencowe  did  so  well  that  six  years  later  this  salary 
was  doubled,  and  he  stood  high  in  the  royal  favor:  Queen  Anne  intervened  in 
his  behalf  during  a dispute  with  All  Souls  College  at  Oxford,  where  he  was  a 
fellow.  But  he  shot  himself  in  a fit  of  temporary  insanity  during  his  recovery 
from  a violent  fever  in  1712.  He  was  succeeded  by  Dr.  John  Keill,  50-year-old 


170 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


professor  of  astronomy  at  Oxford,  who,  though  a fellow  of  the  Royal  Society, 
proved  totally  incompetent.  On  May  14,  1716,  Keill  was  replaced  by  Edward 
Willes,  a 22-year-old  minister  at  Oriel  College,  Oxford. 

Willes  embarked  at  once  upon  a career  unique  in  the  annals  of  cryptology 
and  the  church.  He  not  only  managed  to  reconcile  his  religious  calling 
with  an  activity  once  condemned  by  churchly  authorities,  but  also  went  on  to 
become  the  only  man  in  history  to  use  cryptanalytic  talents  to  procure  eccle- 
siastical rewards.  Within  two  years,  he  had  been  named  rector  of  Barton, 
Bedfordshire,  for  solving  more  than  300  pages  of  cipher  that  exposed 
Sweden’s  attempt  to  foment  an  uprising  in  England.  He  virtually  guaranteed 
his  future  when  he  testified  before  the  House  of  Lords  in  1723.  Here,  Francis 
Atterbury,  Bishop  of  Rochester,  was  being  tried  by  his  peers  for  attempting 
to  set  a pretender  on  the  English  throne. 

The  pretender’s  cause  exhorted  the  allegiance  of  many  in  England,  and 
the  nation’s  attention  focused  on  Atterbury’s  trial.  Most  of  the  facts  about  the 
alleged  conspiracy  had  come  from  his  intercepted  correspondence,  and  the 
most  inculpatory  evidence  had  been  extracted  from  the  portions  in  cipher  by 
Willes  and  by  Anthony  Corbiere,  a former  foreign  service  official  in  his  mid- 
thirties who  had  also  been  appointed  a Decypherer  in  1719.  The  Lords 
“thought  it  proper  to  call  the  Decypherers  before  them,  in  order  to  their  being 
satisfied  of  the  Truth  of  the  Decyphering.”  To  demonstrate  this,  Willes  and 
Corbiere  deposed, 

That  several  Letters,  written  in  this  Cypher,  had  been  decyphered  by  them 
separately,  one  being  many  Miles  distant  in  the  Country,  and  the  other  in  Town; 
and  yet  their  Decyphering  agreed ; 

That  Facts,  unknown  to  them  and  the  Government  at  the  Time  of  their 
Decyphering,  had  been  verified  in  every  Circumstance  by  subsequent  Discoveries; 

as,  particularly,  that  of  H 's  Ship  coming  in  Ballast  to  fetch  O to  England 

which  had  been  so  decyphered  by  them  Two  Months  before  the  Government 
had  the  least  Notice  of  Halstead's  having  left  England ; 

That  a Supplement  of  this  Cypher,  having  been  found  among  Dennis  Kelly's 
Papers  the  latter  End  of  July,  agreed  with  the  Key  they  had  formed  of  that  Cypher 
the  April  before; 

That  the  Decyphering  of  the  Letters  signed  Jones  Illington  and  1378,  being 
afterwards  applied  by  them  to  others  written  in  the  same  Cypher,  did  immediately 
make  pertinent  Sense,  and  such  as  had  an  evident  Connexion  and  Coherence  with 
the  Parts  of  those  Letters  that  were  out  of  Cypher,  though  the  Words  in  Cypher 
were  repeated  in  different  Paragraphs,  and  differently  combined. 

The  two  Decypherers  appeared  before  the  Lords  on  several  occasions  to 
swear  to  their  solutions.  Atterbury  twice  objected  and  was  twice  overruled. 
But  on  May  7,  as  Willes  was  testifying  to  the  cryptanalysis  of  the  three  most 
incriminatory  letters  of  all,  and  the  bishop  felt  the  noose  tightening  around 
him,  he  persisted  in  questioning  Willes  on  the  validity  of  the  reading  though 
the  House  had  supported  Willes’  refusal  to  answer.  He  raised  such  a corn-

The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

motion  that  he  and  his  counsel  were  ordered  to  withdraw,  and  the  Lords 
voted  upon  the  proposition,  “that  it  is  the  Opinion  of  this  House  that  it  is  not 
consistent  with  the  public  Safety,  to  ask  the  Decypherers  any  Questions, 
which  may  tend  to  discover  the  Art  or  Mystery  of  Decyphering. ’’  It  was 
resolved  in  the  affirmative,  the  solutions  were  accepted,  and  Atterbury, 
largely  on  this  evidence,  was  found  guilty,  deprived  of  office,  and  banished 
from  the  realm. 

Willes,  on  the  other  hand,  became  Canon  of  Westminster  the  next  year. 
His  salary  more  than  doubled  to  £500.  He  succeeded  to  ever  more  important 
posts  every  four  or  six  years  thereafter,  and  finally,  in  1742,  when  the  oldest 
of  his  three  sons,  Edward,  Jr.,  obtained  a patent  as  a Decypherer,  he  was 
created  Bishop  of  St.  David’s,  being  translated  the  next  year  to  the  more 
prestigious  see  of  Bath  and  Wells.  The  bishop  and  his  son  shared  the  sub- 
stantial salary  of  £1,000  a year.  In  1752,  he  brought  another  son,  William, 
into  the  business  at  an  eventual  £200,  and  six  years  later  a third  son,  Francis, 
who  for  some  reason  served  without  pay. 

Bishop  Willes  died  in  1773  and  was  buried  in  Westminster  Abbey.  His 
sons  Edward,  Jr.,  and  Francis  inherited  a large  share  of  his  fortune  and  landed 
property  and,  living  as  wealthy  squires  at  Barton  and  Hampstead,  continued 
their  cryptanalytic  work.  Their  brother  William  had  retired  in  1794,  but  his 
three  sons,  Edward,  William,  and  Francis  Willes  joined  the  Decyphering 
Branch  in  the  1790s. 

Though  the  Willes  family  dominated  the  cryptanalytic  branch,  others 
worked  in  it.  Corbiere  was  paid  through  such  sinecures  as  his  appointment  as 
naval  officer  at  Jamaica,  though  he  never  stirred  from  England,  and  as 
Commissioner  of  Wines  Licenses,  which  sounds  like  the  cushiest  of  posts.  He 
rose  to  Under  Secretary  of  the  Post  Office  but  continued  his  cryptanalytic 
work,  which  ended  after  24  years  only  with  his  death  in  1743,  when  he  was 
receiving  £800.  The  other  cryptanalysts  at  various  times  were  James  Rivers, 
Frederick  Ashfield,  John  Lampe,  George  Neubourg,  John  Bode,  Jr.,  one 
Scholing,  and  a Boelstring. 

These  men  received  their  foreign  interceptions  from  the  Secret  Office  and 
their  domestic  ones  from  the  Private  Office,  both  subdivisions  of  the  Post 
Office.  The  Secret  Office  was  quartered  in  three  rooms  adjoining  the  Foreign 
Office  and  entered  privately  from  Abchurch  Lane.  Fire  and  candles  burned 
constantly  in  one  room;  the  staff  lodged  in  the  others.  It  included  men  who 
made  their  life’s  work  the  specialty  of  unsealing  diplomatic  packets  with  such 
deftness  that  they  could  be  resealed  without  evidence  of  tampering;  one  such 
opener  was  J.  E.  Bode,  father  of  John  Bode,  Jr.  He  regularly  spent  three  hours 
on  the  dispatches  of  the  King  of  Prussia,  opening  them  and  then  resealing 
them  with  special  wax  and  carefully  counterfeited  seals.  Perhaps  surprisingly 
in  a bastion  of  human  rights,  its  interceptions  enjoyed  full  legality.  The  statute 
of  1657  that  established  the  postal  service  declared  outright  that  the  mails 
were  the  best  means  of  discovering  dangerous  and  wicked  designs  against  the

commonwealth.  Leases  of  1660  and  1663,  confirmed  by  the  Post  Office  Act  of 
1711,  permitted  government  officials  to  open  mail  under  warrants  that  they 
themselves  issued.  They  sidestepped  this  bothersome  procedure  by  promul- 
gating all-inclusive  general  warrants.*  The  Secret  Office  sent  interceptions  en 
clair  to  the  king  and  those  in  cipher  to  the  cryptanalysts. 

They  were  known  collectively  as  the  Decyphering  Branch.  Unlike  the 
Secret  Office,  the  branch  had  no  specific  location.  Its  tiny  staff  of  experts 
worked  largely  at  home,  receiving  their  material  by  special  messenger.  Nor 
had  it  any  formal  organization,  the  senior  Decypherer  being  merely  first 
among  equals.  More  secret  than  the  Secret  Office,  the  branch’s  funds  came 
from  secret-service  money  issued  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Post  Office  from 
Parliament’s  surplus  revenue.  Security  was  tight — in  all  of  England  probably 
only  30  people  knew  what  diplomatic  correspondence  was  being  read  at  any 
given  moment.  Nevertheless,  most  men  of  affairs  were  aware  of  the  practice 
of  opening  private  letters,  and  they  often  enciphered  their  correspondence  or 
entrusted  it  to  private  messengers  when  secrecy  was  essential. 

After  the  Elector  of  Hanover  succeeded  to  the  English  throne  as  George  I 
in  1714,  retaining  the  rule  of  the  German  state,  the  Decyphering  Branch  col- 
laborated with  the  black  chamber  maintained  at  Nienburg  by  the  Hanoverian 
government.  Cryptanalysts  Bode,  Lampe,  and  Neubourg  had  even  been 
imported  from  there — an  ironic  development  in  view  of  Wallis’  refusal  to 
divulge  his  techniques  to  Hanover  a few  years  earlier.  Mail  opening  became 
habitual.  George  and  his  successors  took  a constant  personal  interest  in  the 
work,  often  encouraging  talent  with  royal  bounty.  Correspondence  was 
closely  watched  for  cribs  that  were  passed  to  the  Decyphering  Branch. 

During  the  1700s,  the  branch’s  output  averaged  two  or  three  dispatches  a 
week,  and  sometimes  one  a day.  Its  cryptanalysts  solved  the  dispatches  of 
France,  Austria,  Saxony  and  other  German  states,  Poland,  Spain,  Portugal, 
Holland,  Denmark,  Sweden,  Sardinia,  Naples  and  other  Italian  states, 
Greece,  Turkey,  Russia,  and,  later,  the  United  States.  The  record  of  French 
interceptions  covers  two  centuries  and  comprises  five  volumes  of  intercepts 
totaling  2,020  pages  plus  three  volumes  of  keys.  Perhaps  more  typical  is  the 
Spanish  dossier — three  volumes  of  intercepts  from  1719  to  1839  totaling  872 
pages.  Not  all  of  the  messages  were  solved  at  the  time  of  their  interception. 
Many  were  held  either  until  enough  had  accumulated  for  a successful  attack 
or  until  a need  arose  for  their  solution. 

The  solutions  were  read  by  the  king  and  a few  of  the  top  ministers.  They 
warned  the  government  of  the  intrigues  of  foreign  rulers  and  ambassadors  and 
of  impending  war.  An  intercepted  message  between  the  Spanish  ambassadors 

* This  activity  forms  the  legal  precedent  for  the  modern  tapping  of  telephones,  at  least 
in  Britain.  Significantly,  however,  the  source  of  the  power  to  intercept  communications 
has  never  been  determined.  The  Crown  simply  exercised  it  and,  despite  occasional  debate, 
has  continued  to  do  so,  presumably  with  the  tacit  approval  of  the  public  as  necessary  for 
the  safety  of  the  state.

The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

in  London  and  Paris  clearly  suggested  that  Spain  had  allied  herself  with 
France  against  England  in  the  Seven  Years’  War.  It  was  read  at  the  British 
cabinet  meeting  of  October  2,  1761.  The  Great  Commoner,  William  Pitt  the 
Elder,  cited  it  as  support  for  his  proposal  that  England  take  the  initiative, 
declare  war  before  Spain  did,  and  capture  the  fleet  of  treasure  ships  then 
transporting  gold  to  Spain  from  her  American  possessions.  His  counsel  was 
rejected,  and  he  resigned.  The  war  came  anyway — after  the  immense  cargo  of 
bullion  had  been  unloaded  at  Cadiz.

The  success  of  the  cryptanalysts  of  France  and  England  was  undoubtedly 
due  in  large  measure  to  their  skill.  But,  as  always,  there  was  another  side  to  it 
which  Franyois  de  Callieres  pointed  out  in  his  superb  little  work  on  diplo- 
macy. The  cryptanalysts,  he  said,  “owe  the  Esteem  they  have  gain’d  solely  to 
the  negligence  of  those  who  give  bad  Cyphers,  and  to  that  of  Ministers  and 
their  Secretaries,  who  make  not  a right  use  of  them.” 

He  omitted  the  important  factor  of  economics.  In  England  in  the  1700s, 
the  Decyphering  Branch  at  first  tested  and,  after  1745,  prepared  England’s 
diplomatic  nomenclators.  These  generally  had  four-figure  codegroups  and 
numerous  homophones;  they  were  printed  on  large  sheets  and  pasted  on 


174 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


boards  for  the  cipher  clerks’  use.  The  cryptanalysts,  who  should  have  known, 
thought  that  it  was  “little  less  than  impossible  to  find  them  out.”  But  their 
initial  strength,  which  was  due  to  the  extent  of  the  lexicon  and  the  many 
homophones,  eventually  proved  a weakness:  the  foreign  service  was  reluctant 
to  change  a nomenclator  that,  in  the  late  1700s,  cost  £150,  or  to  order  separate 
nomenclators  for  separate  countries.  Thus  some  remained  in  use  for  a dozen 
years  or  more,  and  some  simultaneously  served  several  embassies.  For 
example,  in  1772  and  1773,  Paris,  Stockholm,  and  Turin  had  Ciphers  and 
Deciphers  k,  l,  m,  n,  o,  and  p;  Florence  had  k,  l,  o,  and  p;  Venice,  K and  l 
for  use  with  Florence  and  m and  n for  other  purposes;  Naples,  m and  n;  and 
Gibraltar,  o and  p. 

But  Callieres  correctly  remarked  failures  to  make  a “right  use”  of  ciphers. 
Time  and  again,  diplomats  enciphered  documents  handed  to  them  by  the 
governments  to  which  they  were  accredited,  giving  those  governments’ 
cryptanalysts  ideal  cribs.  They  repeated  in  clear  dispatches  sent  in  cipher. 
Because  of  language  difficulties,  they  used  foreigners  in  secret  work.  And 
often  their  chiefs  simply  did  not  want  to  believe  in  cryptanalysis  because  it 
meant  more  work  for  them.  In  1771,  for  example,  the  French  ambassador  to 
England  complained  that  he  had  only  two  old  ciphers  and  that  there  was  in 
London  “a  bishop  [Willes]  charged  with  the  decipherment  of  the  dispatches 
of  foreign  ministers  who  succeeds  in  finding  the  key  of  all  ciphers.”  His 
superior  replied  that  not  even  a bishop  could  translate  French  ciphers,  “which 
have  no  kind  of  system  and  of  which  it  is  not  possible  to  find  the  key  because 
one  does  not  exist.”  Then,  after  rather  heavy-handedly  pointing  out  that 
ciphers  are  sometimes  compromised  through  the  indiscretions  of  those  who 
hold  them,  he  added,  “I  do  not  believe  in  decipherers  any  more  than  in 
magicians.” 

This  sentiment  found  its  most  pointed  expression  in  Voltaire’s  remark  that 
“those  who  boast  of  deciphering  a letter  without  being  instructed  in  the 
affairs  of  which  it  treats,  and  without  having  any  preliminary  help,  are  greater 
charlatans  than  those  who  boast  of  understanding  a language  which  they 
have  not  even  studied.”  For  once,  one  of  his  epigrams  rang  false. 

Across  the  Atlantic,  cryptology  reflected  the  free,  individualistic  nature  of 
the  people  from  which  it  sprang.  No  black  chambers,  no  organized  develop- 
ment, no  paid  cryptanalysts.  But  this  native  cryptology,  which  had  much  of 
the  informal,  shirtsleeve  quality  of  a pioneer  barn-raising,  nevertheless 
played  its  small  but  helpful  role  in  enabling  the  American  colonies  to  assume 
among  the  powers  of  the  earth  their  separate  and  equal  station.  Indeed,  the  first 
incident  occurred  even  before  those  colonies  had  declared  their  independence. 

It  started  in  August  of  1 775.  A baker  named  Godfrey  Wen  wood  was  visited 
in  Newport,  Rhode  Island,  by  a girl  whom  he  had  formerly  known  intimately. 
She  asked  him  for  help  in  getting  in  touch  with  some  British  officers  so  that 
she  could  give  them  a letter.  Wenwood,  a rebel  patriot,  grew  suspicious.  He 


The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers  175 

persuaded  her  to  give  him  the  letter  for  delivery  and  to  depart  before  his 
fiancee  learned  of  her  visit.  But  he  did  not  forward  it. 

Instead,  he  consulted  a schoolmaster  friend.  The  friend  broke  the  seal  and 
found  inside  three  pages  covered  with  line  after  neatly  printed  line  of  small 
Greek  characters,  odd  symbols,  numbers,  and  letters.  Unable  to  penetrate  the 
mystery,  he  handed  the  missive  back  to  Wenwood,  who  tucked  it  away  while 
he  considered  the  matter  further.  But  soon  thereafter  he  received  a letter  from 
the  girl,  who  complained  that  “you  never  Sent  wot  you  promest  to  send.  His 
suspicions  now  thoroughly  aroused,  Wenwood  went  up  through  channels 
and  at  the  end  of  September  was  standing  in  the  headquarters  of  Lieutenant 
General  George  Washington,  showing  him  the  letter. 

The  commander  in  chief  could  not  read  the  cryptogram  either,  but  he 
could  question  the  girl.  She  was  brought  in  that  evening,  and  though,  Wash- 
ington said  later,  “for  a long  time  she  was  proof  against  every  threat  and 
persuasion  to  discover  the  author,”  intensive  interrogation  wore  her  down.

Last  lines  of  the  cipher  message  of  the  Tory  spy.  Dr . Benjamin  Church 

The  next  day,  she  finally  revealed  that  the  letter  had  been  given  to  her  by  her 
current  lover,  Dr.  Benjamin  Church,  Jr.  Washington  was  astounded.  Church 
was  his  own  director  general  of  hospitals.  A prosperous  Boston  physician  who 
was  a leader  in  the  Massachusetts  Congress  and  a colleague  of  Samuel  Adams 
and  John  Hancock  in  the  new  House  of  Representatives,  he  had  just  asked  to 
resign  as  hospitals  chief.  Washington  had  turned  down  his  request  because  of 
his  own  “unwillingness  to  part  with  a good  officer.”  Could  so  distinguished 
a man  be  engaged  in  a clandestine  and  possibly  traitorous  correspondence? 
But  he  was  brought  in  under  guard. 

The  letter  was  his,  he  readily  admitted,  intended  for  his  brother,  Fleming 
Church,  who  was  in  Boston— though  it  was  addressed  to  “Major  [Maurice] 
Cane  in  Boston  on  his  majisty’s  service.”  If  deciphered,  it  would  be  found  to 
contain  nothing  criminal.  But  though  he  repeatedly  protested  his  loyalty  to 
the  Colonial  cause,  he  did  not  offer  to  put  the  contents  of  his  letter  into  plain 
language. 

Washington  cast  about  for  someone  who  could  solve  it.  He  located  the 
Reverend  Mr.  Samuel  West,  45,  a rather  absentminded  pastor  who  was, 


176 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


ironically,  a Harvard  classmate  of  Church’s.  West,  who  later  served  as  a 
delegate  to  the  Constitutional  Convention  of  1787,  was  interested  in  alchemy 
and  became  convinced  that  prophetic  portions  of  the  Bible  predicted  the  course 
of  events  of  the  American  Revolution. 

When  Washington's  need  for  a cryptanalyst  became  known,  Elbridge 
Gerry,  31,  chairman  of  the  Massachusetts  committee  of  military  supply, 
volunteered  his  help.  Gerry  went  on  to  greater  fame  as  fifth  Vice  President  of 
the  United  States  and  concocter  of  the  political  grotesquery  known  today  as 
the  “gerrymander.”  He  also  suggested  the  name  of  Colonel  Elisha  Porter  of 
the  Massachusetts  militia,  who  had  been  a year  ahead  of  him  at  Harvard. 
Gerry  and  Porter  teamed  to  attack  the  message,  and  West  worked  by  himself 
through  the  night. 

Washington  received  the  two  solutions  of  what  proved  to  be  a mon- 
alphabetic  substitution  on  October  3.  They  were  identical.  Church  was 
reporting  to  Thomas  Gage,  the  British  commander,  on  American  ammunition 
supply,  on  a plan  for  commissioning  privateers,  on  rations,  recruiting, 
currency,  a proposed  attack  on  Canada,  artillery  that  he  had  counted  at 
Kingsbridge,  New  York,  troop  strength  in  Philadelphia,  and  the  mood  of 
the  Continental  Congress.  It  ended:  “Make  use  of  every  precaution  or  I 
perish.” 

This,  to  Washington,  refuted  Church’s  protestations  that  he  had  deliber- 
ately transmitted  the  information  to  the  redcoats  to  impress  them  with 
patriot  strength  and  so  deter  them  from  attacking  just  when  American 
ammunition  was  low.  It  also  convinced  most  Colonial  leaders  of  his  guilt. 
“ . . . what  a complication  of  madness  and  wickedness  must  a soul  be  filled 
with  to  be  capable  of  such  perfidy!”  ejaculated  an  angry  Rhode  Island  dele- 
gate. And  the  paymaster  general  of  the  Continental  forces  commented,  “I 
have  now  no  difficulty  to  account  for  the  knowledge  Gage  had  of  all  our 
Congress  secrets,  and  how  some  later  plans  have  been  rendered  abortive.”  It 
also  developed  that  information  furnished  by  Church  caused  Gage  to  send 
troops  to  Boston  to  capture  American  stores  at  Concord — a move  that  re- 
sulted in  the  historic  clash  at  Lexington  that  began  the  American  Revolution. 

Church  was  imprisoned.  The  Massachusetts  legislature  expelled  him. 
When  he  was  paroled  briefly,  a mob  assailed  him.  Congress  rejected  a British 
proposal  to  exchange  him.  Finally,  in  1780,  Massachusetts  exiled  him  to  the 
West  Indies  under  pain  of  death  should  he  return.  But  the  small  schooner  in 
which  he  sailed  was  never  heard  of  again,  and  the  first  American  to  have  lost 
his  liberty  as  a result  of  cryptanalysis  evidently  lost  his  life  because  of  it  as 
well. 

Cryptology  served  another  traitor  much  better.  No  mere  monalphabetic 
substitution  for  ambitious  Benedict  Arnold.  He  played  for  much  higher  stakes 
and  his  systems  excelled  in  security.  The  correspondence  between  Arnold,  in 
charge  at  West  Point,  and  John  Andre,  an  engaging  young  British  major 


177 


The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

whose  gallantry  caused  some  to  call  him  the  “English  Nathan  Hale,”  was 
conducted  in  several  types  of  code.  Arnold  apparently  handled  his  own 
cryptographic  duties,  but  encoding  and  decoding  at  the  Tory  end  devolved 
largely  upon  Jonathan  Odell,  a Loyalist  clergyman  of  New  York,  and  upon 
Joseph  Stansbury,  a Philadelphia  merchant  also  partial  to  the  Crown. 

At  first  they  employed  a book  code  based  on  volume  I of  the  fifth  Oxford 
edition  of  the  legal  classic,  Blackstone’s  Commentaries.  “Three  Numbers 
make  a Word,”  Andre  instructed  Stansbury,  “the  1st  is  the  Page  the  2d  the 
Line  the  third  the  Word.”  Words  not  in  the  book  were  to  be  spelled  out,  and 
these  codenumbers  distinguished  from  the  others  by  drawing  a line  through 
the  last  number,  which  then  represented  the  position  of  a letter  in  that  line 
instead  of  a word. 

They  promptly  ran  into  unsuspected  practical  difficulties.  Only  a very 
few  of  the  encoded  words  (the  messages  were  encoded  only  in  part)  could  be 
found  whole,  such  as  general  (35.12.8)  and  men  (7.14.3).  Arnold  managed  to 
find  the  word  militia,  but  he  had  to  search  to  page  337  to  find  it,  whereas  the 
other  words  in  his  message  of  June  18,  1779,  came  from  pages  35,  91,  and  101. 
Most  of  the  words  and  the  proper  names  had  to  be  spelled  out  in  an  enor- 
mously cumbersome  fashion  that  required  tedious  counting  for  each  letter 
and  then  the  writing  of  four  digits  as  its  ciphertext  equivalent.  Sullivan,  for 
instance,  became  (with  a stroke  through  the  final  number  of  each  group) 
35.3.1  35.3.2  34.2.4  35.2.5  35.3.5  35.7.7  35.2.3  35.5.2.  Arnold  consequently 
abandoned  the  system  after  sending  one  message  in  the  Blackstone  code,  and 
receiving  only  one  from  Stansbury  to  Odell. 

The  conspirators  switched  to  the  best-selling  Universal  Etymological 
English  Dictionary  of  Nathan  Bailey  as  a codebook;  the  words,  being  listed 
alphabetically,  were  considerably  easier  to  locate.  Then  they  turned  to  a small 
dictionary,  which  has  not  been  identified.  Through  its  pages  sifted  the  bulk  of 
the  clandestine  correspondence  relating  to  Arnold’s  betrayal  of  West  Point 
to  the  British  in  return  for  money,  security,  and  honor.  Both  sides  enciphered 
their  codenumbers  by  adding  7 to  each  of  the  three  figures— including  the 
middle  digit  which,  representing  the  column,  always  appeared  as  8 or  9 in 
what  would  have  been  a giveaway  to  the  system.  But  the  security  of  the 
system  was  never  put  to  the  test  of  Colonial  cryptanalysis,  for  the  attempted 
betrayal  was  blocked  by  the  capture  of  Andre  before  any  of  the  missives  were 
intercepted.  He  was  hanged ; Arnold  escaped— to  a life  of  ignominy. 

British  spy  cryptography  was  surpassed  by  that  of  the  two  most  important 
American  agents.  Samuel  Woodhull  of  Setauket,  Long  Island,  and  Robert 
Townsend  of  New  York  City  supplied  Washington  with  reams  of  information 
about  the  redcoat  occupation  of  New  York  during  1779.  They  wrote  their 
reports  in  a one-part  nomenclator  of  about  800  elements  that  had  been 
constructed  by  one  of  Washington’s  spymasters.  Major  Benjamin  Tallmadge 
of  the  Second  Connecticut  Dragoons.  Tallmadge  extracted  the  words  he 
thought  would  be  needed  from  a copy  of  John  Entick  s New  Spelling  Diction-

Benedict  Arnold's  dictionary-code  message  of  July  15,  1780 , to  Major  John  Andre,

Tallmadge  provided  copies  of  these  pocket  codes  to  both  spies  and  to 
Washington,  and  kept  one  himself.  A typical  letter  from  Woodhull,  dated 
at  Setauket,  August  15,  1779,  began:  “Sir:  Dqpeu  Beyocpu  agreeable  to  28 
met  723  not  far  from  727  and  received  a 356,  but  on  his  return  was  under  the 
necessity  to  destroy  the  same,  or  be  detected.  . . .”  (dqpeu  beyocpu  was 
Jonas  Hawkins,  a messenger.)  The  spies  further  masked  their  identity  under 
codenames,  Woodhull  being  culper  sr.  and  Townsend  culper  jr. 

The  culpers  used  invisible  ink  extensively.  Washington  supplied  them, 
getting  it  from  Sir  James  Jay,  who  had  been  a physician  in  London  and  was 
the  brother  of  John  Jay,  the  American  statesman  who  became  the  first  Chief 
Justice.  Sir  James  recounted  the  story  of  the  ink  in  a letter  he  wrote  years 
later  to  Thomas  Jefferson : 

When  the  affairs  of  America,  previous  to  the  commencement  of  hostilities, 
began  to  wear  a serious  aspect,  and  threatened  to  issue  in  civil  war,  it  occurred 
to  me  that  a fluid  might  possibly  be  discovered  for  invisible  writing,  which 
would  elude  the  generally  known  means  of  detection,  and  yet  could  be  rendered 
visible  by  a suitable  counterpart.  Sensible  of  the  great  advantages,  both  in  a 
political  and  military  line,  which  we  might  derive  from  such  a mode  of  procuring 
and  transmitting  intelligence,  I set  about  the  work.  After  innumerable  experi- 
ments, I succeeded  to  my  wish.  From  England  I sent  to  my  brother  John  in  New 
York,  considerable  quantities  of  these  preparations.  ...  In  the  course  of  the  war, 
General  Washington  was  also  furnished  with  them,  and  I have  letters  from  him 
acknowledging  their  great  utility,  and  requesting  further  supplies.  ...  By  means 
of  this  mode  of  conveying  intelligence,  I transmitted  to  America  the  first  authen- 
tic account  which  Congress  received,  of  the  determination  of  the  British  Ministry 
to  reduce  the  Colonies  to  unconditional  submission;  the  ministry  at  the  time 
concealing  this  design,  and  holding  out  conciliatory  measures.  My  method  of 
communication  was  this:  To  prevent  the  suspicion  which  might  arise  were  I to 
write  to  my  brother  John  only,  who  was  a member  of  Congress,  I writ  with  black 
ink  a short  letter  to  him,  and  likewise  to  1 or  2 other  persons  of  the  family,  none 
exceeding  3 or  4 lines  in  black  ink.  The  residue  of  the  blank  paper  I filled  up, 
invisibly,  with  such  intelligence  and  matters  as  I thought  would  be  useful  to  the 
American  Cause.  ...  In  this  invisible  writing  I sent  to  [Benjamin]  Franklin  and 
[Silas]  Deane,  by  the  mail  from  London  to  Paris,  a plan  of  the  intended  Expedi- 
tion under  Burgoyne  from  Canada. 

By  July,  1779,  Washington  was  writing  culper  sr.:  “All  the  white  Ink  I 
now  have  (indeed  all  that  there  is  any  prospect  of  getting  soon)  is  sent  in 
phial  No.  1 by  Col.  Webb.  The  liquid  in  No.  2 is  the  counterpart  which 
renders  the  other  visible  by  wetting  the  paper  with  a fine  brush  after  the 

first  has  been  used  and  is  dry.  You  will  send  these  to  c R,  junr.,  as  soon  as 

possible,  and  I beg  that  no  mention  may  ever  be  made  of  your  having  received 
such  liquids  from  me  or  anyone  else.”  But  though  Washington  urged  the  use 


180 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


of  a cover-text  in  black  ink,  the  culpers  customarily  wrote  their  message  on 
a blank  sheet  of  paper,  inserting  the  sheet  at  a predetermined  point  in  a whole 
package  of  the  same  letter  paper. 

Numerous  letters  in  this  “stain” — as  Washington  and  the  culpers 
generally  called  the  secret  ink — successfully  eluded  British  inspection  and 
transported  considerable  information  to  the  American  commander  in  chief. 
The  reports  of  the  culpers  were  filled  with  detail  on  such  matters  as  how 
many  troops  were  stationed  where,  what  warships  were  anchored  in  New 
York  harbor,  what  provisions  were  entering  the  town,  and  so  forth.  Washing- 
ton found  their  reports  “intelligent,  clear  and  satisfactory”  and  said  of 
culper  jr.  that  “I  rely  upon  his  intelligence.” 

The  redcoats  used  invisible  ink  even  earlier  than  the  Americans.  Only  a 
few  days  after  the  Battle  of  Lexington,  British  headquarters  in  Boston  re- 
ceived a secret-ink  letter  which  revealed  some  of  the  military  plans  of  the 
New  England  patriot  forces.  “.  . . the  first  movement  will  be  to  make  a feint 
attack  upon  the  Town  of  Boston,”  the  invisible  portion  read  in  part,  “&  at 
the  same  time  to  attempt  the  castle  with  the  main  body  of  their  Army.”  The 
handwriting  shows  the  document  to  be  from  Benjamin  Thompson,  a hated 
Tory,  who,  after  a series  of  colorful  adventures,  became  Count  Rumford  of 
the  Holy  Roman  Empire  and  a widely  known  scientist.  He  used  gallotannic 
acid  for  his  ink,  which  the  British  developed  by  ferrous  sulphate — a procedure 
described  by  Porta,  from  whose  Natural  Magick  Thompson,  who  had  been 
avid  for  science  since  his  teens,  had  probably  borrowed  it. 

When  it  came  to  ciphers,  the  British  provided  themselves  with  a veritable 
menagerie  of  systems.  Sir  Henry  Clinton,  British  commander  in  New  York, 
had  a small  one-part  nomenclator;  he  also  had  a monoalphabetic  substitution 
in  which  a = 51,  b = 52,  c = 53,  and  so  on.  He  had  a truncated  alphabet 
tableau  of  twelve  lines.  He  even  had  a pigpen  cipher.  Still  other  specimens 
inhabited  this  cryptographic  zoo,  but  the  only  one  Clinton  is  known  to  have 
used  in  the  early  part  of  the  war  is  a degenerate  form  of  grille  called  the 
dumbbell  cipher,  from  the  hourglass  shape  of  its  one  large  hole. 

In  the  summer  of  1777,  Clinton  had  to  inform  General  John  Burgoyne, 
driving  south  down  the  Hudson  in  an  attempt  to  cut  the  colonies  in  two,  that 
he  would  have  trouble  pushing  north  to  a meeting  because  his  superior,  Sir 
William  Howe,  had  taken  most  of  his  troops  to  Philadelphia.  On  August  10, 
Clinton  wrote  as  part  of  his  secret  message  a heartfelt  Sir  W's  move  just  at  this 
time  the  worst  he  could  take.  His  cover-text  for  this  portion,  which  necessarily 
had  to  include  many  of  these  words,  stated  just  the  opposite:  sir  w’s  move 
JUST  AT  THIS  TIME  HAS  BEEN  CAPITAL;  WASHINGTON'S  HAVE  BEEN  THE  WORST  HE 
could  take  in  every  respect.  But  it  was  patently  absurd  for  a commander  to 
assert  that  the  loss  of  his  troops  was  “capital”;  the  example  throws  a sharp 
light  on  the  weakness  of  the  grille.  Whether  the  message  got  through  or  not, 
and  if  it  did  whether  it  disheartened  Burgoyne,  is  unknown.  It  is  known 
that,  deprived  of  the  help  of  Clinton’s  column  from  the  south,  he  lost  the

The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

Battle  of  Saratoga,  which  helped  determine  the  ultimate  outcome  of  the 
Revolution. 

While  code  and  cipher  systems  proliferated  throughout  the  Revolution, 
cryptanalysis  hibernated.  The  basic  reason  seems  to  be  that,  with  the  excep- 
tion of  an  infrequent  episode  like  that  of  the  Church  cipher,  no  cryptograms 
were  intercepted.  It  was  not  until  the  war  neared  its  end  that  enough  messages 
were  captured  to  make  recurrent  cryptanalyses  possible.  Most  of  the  messages 
were  solved  by  James  Lovell,  a member  of  the  Continental  Congress  who  may 
be  called  the  Father  of  American  Cryptanalysis. 

Lovell,  born  in  Boston  on  October  31,  1737,  graduated  from  Harvard  in 
1756  and  then  taught  for  eighteen  years  in  his  father’s  South  Grammar 
School  in  Boston.  His  father  was  a fervid  Loyalist,  but  James  was  named  as 
the  first  orator  to  commemorate  the  Boston  Massacre,  and  in  1775  was 
arrested  by  the  British  as  an  American  spy.  After  his  exchange,  he  was  elected 
a delegate  to  the  Continental  Congress.  He  took  his  seat  in  1777,  and  promptly 
distinguished  himself  for  zeal  and  industry,  particularly  on  the  Committee  on 
Foreign  Affairs.  It  is  said  that  he  never  once  in  the  next  five  years  visited  his 
wife  and  children.  He  offered  a design  for  the  Great  Seal  of  the  United  States, 
which,  however,  was  rejected.  He  quit  Congress  in  April  of  1782  and  was 
appointed  receiver  of  continental  taxes  in  Boston,  and,  in  1789,  naval  officer 
for  the  district  of  Boston  and  Charlestown,  the  post  he  held  until  his  death 
in  1814. 

He  was  regarded  as  gifted  in  intrigue  and  as  a lover  of  mystery.  Where  he 
learned  cryptology  is  not  known,  but  as  early  as  1777,  he  was  endorsing 
Arthur  Lee’s  proposal  that  the  Committee  of  Secret  Correspondence  use  a 
dictionary  as  a codebook.  Two  years  later,  he  urged  Major  General  Horatio 
Gates,  whom  he  preferred  over  Washington  as  commander  in  chief,  to  “Ask 
Dr.  Joseph  Gardner,  one  of  my  best  earthly  friends,  to  let  your  clerk  copy  an 
alphabet  which  he  had  from  me.”  The  system  was  a Vigenere  using  numbers 
instead  of  cipher  letters;  Lovell  keyed  a letter  in  it  to  Gates  with  the  name 
JAMES.  The  same  system,  with  key  CR,  served  him  in  enciphering  letters  to 
John  and  Abigail  Adams  in  1781.  The  following  year,  after  a mail  robbery 
had  compromised  the  nomenclator  of  846  elements  used  by  Virginia’s 
delegates  to  Congress,  one  of  them,  the  acid-tongued  Edmund  Randolph, 
proposed  to  another,  James  Madison,  that  they  employ  “the  cypher  which  we 
were  taught  by  Mr.  Lovell.  Let  the  keyword  be  the  name  of  the  negro  boy  who 
used  to  wait  on  our  common  friend  Mr.  Jas.  Madison.”  This  name  was 
CUPID,  the  system  a numerical  Vigenere.  It  is  significant  that  Lovell  was  here 
popularizing  a system  that  was  relatively  obscure  and  little  used,  but  that  was 
then  the  only  type  that  lay  beyond  the  known  limits  of  cryptanalysis.  Later, 
however,  errors  compelled  its  abandonment. 

Lovell’s  successes  in  solution  came  at  the  most  opportune  time.  In  the  fall 
of  1781,  Lord  Cornwallis,  Britain’s  second-in-command  in  America,  had 


182 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


moved  his  troops  north  from  the  Carolinas  to  Virginia.  He  was  convinced 
that  that  colony  had  to  be  taken  before  the  southern  colonies  could  be  held, 
and  he  marched  down  the  James  River  toward  the  coast  in  the  hope  of 
receiving  reinforcements  by  sea  from  his  chief,  General  Clinton,  in  New  York. 
He  planned  to  reduce  Virginia,  conquer  the  Carolinas,  and  quell  the  revolu- 
tion for  His  Britannic  Majesty,  King  George  III. 

It  was  at  this  juncture  that  the  American  commander  in  the  South, 
Nathanael  Greene,  sent  to  Congress,  as  he  had  done  before,  some  intercepted 
redcoat  cryptograms  that  no  one  in  his  headquarters  could  read,  enclosing 
them  in  a general  report.  The  British  correspondence  was  among  Cornwallis 
and  several  of  his  subordinates. 

Greene's  report  was  read  in  Congress  September  17.  Four  days  later, 
Lovell  had  solved  the  enclosures.  A few  were  in  a simple  monalphabetic 
substitution,  but  most  were  in  a bastard  system  that  combined  the  poorest 
features  of  mon-  and  polyalphabeticity.  A single  numerical  cipher  alphabet 
enciphered  four  to  ten  lines  mon  alphabetically,  and  then  shifted  to  provide 
new  ciphertext  equivalents.  For  example,  the  positions  were  as  follows  for 
lines  1,  10,  and  14  of  the  first  page  of  the  first  letter: 

line  abcdef  g h iklmnopqrs  t uvwxyz 
1 19  9 17  13  16  7 12  8 14  15  26  4 18  21  3 2 11  5 24  29  1 25  23  22  6 

10  23  22  6 19  9 17  13  16  7 12  8 14  15  26  4 18  21  3 2115  24  29  1 25 

14  5 24  29  1 25  23  22  6 19  9 17  13  16  7 12  8 14  15  26  4 18  21  3 2 11 

Any  number  above  30  was  a null,  and  these  were  sprinkled  freely  throughout 

the  message.  Changes  in  alphabets  were  signaled  by  both  a bracketlike  mark 
and  a series  of  four  to  seven  nulls.  No  pattern  appeared  in  the  shifting; 
presumably  it  followed  a list  prearranged  by  the  correspondents. 

Unfortunately,  the  tactical  situation  had  changed  too  much  for  the 
information  in  the  Carolina  intercepts  to  be  of  much  good.  But  the  keys  that 
Lovell  had  recovered  might  possibly  prove  valuable  some  time  in  the  future, 
and  so  he  took  the  precaution  of  writing  Washington:  “It  is  not  improbable 
that  the  Enemy  have  a plan  of  cyphering  their  letters  which  is  pretty  general 
among  their  Chiefs.  If  so,  your  Excellency  will  perhaps  reap  Benefit  from 
making  your  Secretary  take  a Copy  of  the  Keys  and  observations  which  I 
send  to  General  Greene,  through  your  Care.” 

Lovell  could  not  have  been  shrewder.  The  system  that  he  had  solved  was, 
as  he  had  guessed,  also  in  service  between  Cornwallis  and  Clinton,  who  was 
the  commander  in  chief  of  all  British  forces  in  America.  Cornwallis  had  by 
now  retired  to  Yorktown  to  await  Clinton’s  reinforcements.  But  Washington 
had  encircled  the  town  with  16,000  men,  while  the  French  admiral,  the  Count 
de  Grasse,  with  24  French  ships  of  the  line,  barred  relief  by  sea.  On  October  6, 
just  after  the  French  and  American  allies  had  driven  a parallel  close  to  the 
British  lines,  Washington  wrote  Lovell,  "My  Secretary  has  taken  a Copy  of 
the  Cyphers,  and  by  the  help  of  one  of  the  Alphabets  has  been  able  to  decipher

The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

one  paragraph  of  a letter  lately  intercepted  going  from  L’d  Cornwallis  to  Sir 
H’y  Clinton.”  The  letter  presumably  gave  Washington  insight  into  conditions 
inside  the  British  fortifications. 

Clinton,  meanwhile,  managed  to  maintain  contact  with  Cornwallis  by 
small  boat.  But  the  vessels  that  he  sent  out  from  New  York  on  September  26 
and  October  3 were  captured  by  the  rebels.  One  of  them  had  been  driven 
ashore  near  Little  Egg  Harbor,  where  the  Tory  who  was  carrying  one  set  of 
dispatches  hid  them  under  a large  stone  before  he  was  captured  and  brought

James  Lovell's  solution  of  a 1781  letter  to  Lord  Cornwallis 

to  Philadelphia.  “By  means  of  a little  address  and  a promise  of  a pardon,”  as 
one  American  put  it,  he  was  persuaded  to  recover  them.  The  search  took  at 
least  two  days,  either  because  “the  beach  is  so  extensive  and  so  many  places 
like  each  other,”  as  the  president  of  Congress,  Thomas  McKean,  wrote 
Washington,  or  because  the  man  was  delaying.  He  still  had  not  returned  with 
them  to  Philadelphia  by  3 p.m.  October  13,  nor,  apparently,  by  the  next 
morning.  At  that  time,  Lovell  sent  to  Washington  through  a French  officer 
what  appears  to  have  been  a supplementary  British  system:  “I  found,  as  I 
had  before  supposed,  that  they  sometimes  use  Entick’s  Dictionary  marking 
the  Page  Column  and  Word  as  115.1.4.  Tis  the  Edition  of  1777  London  by 
Charles  Dilley.” 

The  Tory  returned  with  the  dispatches  some  time  during  October  14. 
Lovell  attacked  them  at  once  and  with  immediate  success,  since  he  found  to 
his  joy  that  they  were  written  in  the  same  alphabets  as  the  rest  of  the  Clinton- 
Cornwallis  correspondence.  The  more  important  message  of  the  two  that  were 


184 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


apparently  intercepted  was  the  one  sent  in  duplicate  by  Clinton  on  September 
30  and  received  by  Cornwallis  on  October  10.  “My  Lord,”  it  began,  “Your 
Lordship  may  be  assured  that  I am  doing  every  thing  in  my  power  to  relieve 
you  by  a direct  move,  and  I have  reason  to  hope,  from  the  assurances  given 
me  this  day  by  Admiral  Graves,  that  we  may  pass  the  bar  by  the  12th  of 
October,  if  the  winds  permit,  and  no  unforeseen  accident  happens:  this, 
however,  is  subject  to  disappointment,  wherefore,  if  I hear  from  you,  your 
wishes  will  of  course  direct  me,  and  I shall  persist  in  my  idea  of  a direct  move, 
even  to  the  middle  of  November.  . . .” 

By  the  evening  of  October  14,  Lovell  was  writing  to  Washington:  “Since 
1 wrote  that  Letter  [of  the  morning],  1 have  been  happy  in  decyphering  what 
the  President  of  Congress  sends  by  this  Opportunity.  The  use  of  the  same 
Cypher  by  all  the  British  Commanders  is  now  pretty  fairly  concluded.  The 
Enemy  play  a grand  Stake,  May  the  Glory  redound  to  the  Allied  Force  under 
your  Excellency’s  Command!” 

This  went  out  with  a letter  of  the  president  of  Congress,  who  told  Wash- 
ington: “My  intelligence  was  true:  the  inclosed  copies  of  two  original  letters 
from  Sir  Henry  Clinton  to  Lord  Cornwallis  which  I have  in  cyphers,  and 
which  have  been  faithfully  decyphered  by  Mr.  Lovell  (whose  key  I had  the 
honor  to  forward  to  you  about  a fortnight  ago)  more  than  prove  the  fact.” 

At  the  same  time,  McKean  also  sent  the  solutions  to  de  Grasse,  whose 
ships  were  to  prevent  Graves  and  Clinton  from  relieving  Cornwallis.  “The 
British  General  and  Admiral  seem  to  be  desperate,  and  willing  to  risque  all  on 
the  intended  attempt,”  he  wrote  de  Grasse,  adding  prophetically,  “If  they  fail 
it  appears  here  that  they  are  disposed  to  give  up  the  contest  for  North 
America.”  De  Grasse  continued  to  blockade  Cornwallis  and  to  watch  for  the 
British  fleet.  Five  days  after  Lovell  had  completed  his  cryptanalytic  exposure 
of  British  plans,  Cornwallis  surrendered.  But  victory  was  not  quite  com- 
plete. Washington  recognized  this  when,  on  the  following  day,  October  20,  he 
received  the  copies  of  the  solutions  that  McKean  had  sent  him  and  lost  “not  an 
instant”  in  forwarding  them  to  de  Grasse.  Doubly  warned,  the  French  admiral 
prepared  for  the  British  attack.  On  October  30,  he  scared  off  the  English  fleet 
and  set  the  seal  of  final  victory  on  the  American  War  for  Independence. 

With  the  coming  of  victory,  the  difficulties  attendant  upon  the  establish- 
ment of  a new  nation  compelled  the  Founding  Fathers  not  only  to  continue 
their  secret  communications,  but  to  extend  and  improve  them.  In  the  fall  of 
1781,  Robert  A.  Livingston,  Secretary  of  Foreign  Affairs,  had  forms  printed 
that  bore  on  one  side  the  numbers  1 to  1700  and  on  the  other  an  alphabetical 
list  of  letters,  syllables,  and  words.  They  served  as  a convenient  basis  for 
correspondents  to  produce  individual  nomenclators  by  assigning  the  code 
numbers  to  the  plaintext  elements  in  whatever  order  they  wished. 

They  were  widely  used.  Madison  and  Thomas  Jefferson  constructed  a code 
on  one  of  them  in  1785,  using  it  at  least  until  1793.  It  was  in  that  year  that 


185 


The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

Madison,  vacationing  in  Fredericksburg,  found  himself  staring  at  this  en- 
lightening passage  in  a letter  from  Jefferson  because  he  had  left  his  key  in 
Philadelphia:  “We  have  decided  unanimously  to  130  ..  . interest  if  they  do 
not  510 ...  to  the  636.  Its  consequences  you  will  readily  seize  but  145  ..  . 
though  the  15.  . . .”  Another  code  composed  on  the  Livingston  forms,  en- 
dorsed “Mr.  Monroe’s  cypher,”  was  used  by  Monroe  in  1805  when  he  was 
minister  to  England,  by  James  A.  Bayard  in  1814  when  he  helped  negotiate 
the  treaty  that  ended  the  War  of  1812,  and  as  late  as  1832  by  President 
Andrew  Jackson  in  letters  to  a diplomatic  agent.  It  therefore  seems  to  have 
been  one  of  the  first  official  codes  of  the  United  States  under  the  Constitution.

The  nomenclator  compiled  in  1785  by  Jefferson  for  use  with  Madison  and  Monroe 


Other  emissaries  used  systems  of  secret  communication  while  the  America 
that  they  were  representing  was  still  little  more  than  thirteen  united  colonies. 
Benjamin  Franklin,  in  France  in  1781,  assigned  consecutive  numbers  to  each 
of  the  682  letters  and  punctuation  marks  in  a long  passage  in  French  to 
concoct  a homophonic  substitution  cipher: 

voulez  — vous  s e nt  i r 1 adi  f f e r e nc  ... 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  ... 

One  message  began,  i have  just  received  a 14,  5,  3,  10,  28,  76,  203,  66,  11,  12, 
273,  50,  14,  . . . the  numbers  deciphering  to  neuucmiissjon.  The  double  u 
was  necessary  because  the  French  passage  has  no  w.  Plaintext  e was  repre- 
sented by  more  than  100  different  numbers.  Another  early  representative, 
William  Carmichael,  minister  in  Madrid,  seems  to  have  made  the  first  re- 
corded suggestion  for  a standard  American  diplomatic  cryptography.  In  a 
letter  to  Jefferson  in  Paris  on  June  27,  1785,  he  wrote:  “It  has  long  been  my 
surprise  that  Congress  hath  not  instructed  those  they  employ  abroad  on  this 
head  [ciphers]:  For  this  purpose  a common  cypher  should  be  sent  to  each  of 
their  Ministers  and  Charge  Des  Affaires.” 


186 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Still  other  systems  were  used.  Before  they  settled  on  the  Livingston-form 
nomenclator,  Jefferson  and  Madison  agreed  to  use  a French-English  lexicon 
as  a codebook.  The  Lee  brothers,  Arthur,  Richard  Henry,  and  William, 
corresponded  from  1777  to  1779  in  a dictionary  code,  probably  the  same 
Entick’s  of  1777  that  Clinton  had  used  and  Lovell  discovered. 

The  most  far-reaching  cryptogram  in  domestic  American  history  used  not 
one  but  three  systems  of  cryptography.  It  served  as  evidence  in  the  sensational 
trial  for  treason  of  the  man  who  had  lost  the  Presidency  by  a single  vote  in 
1800  and  who  became  Vice  President  instead — Aaron  Burr. 

After  killing  Alexander  Hamilton  in  a duel  in  1804,  Burr  headed  west, 
fired  with  his  dream  of  carving  out  a colonial  empire  in  the  Southwest  at  the 
expense  of  Spain,  with  whom  war  then  seemed  imminent.  Whether  this 
empire  was  to  be  the  United  States’  or  Burr’s  was  never  clear.  His  military 
accomplice  in  this  grandiose  scheme  was  General  James  Wilkinson,  who, 
unknown  to  Burr,  was  a paid  Spanish  agent.  Though  Burr  had  used  a card- 
board cipher  disk  with  numbers  for  polyalphabetic  substitution  in  1800  and 
in  a letter  to  his  son-in-law  in  1804,  he  and  Wilkinson  decided  to  combine 
into  a single  system  of  cryptography  for  their  great  work  a symbol  code  in 
which,  for  example,  a circle  stood  for  “President,”  a symbol  cipher  in  which  a 
dash  represented  a,  and  a dictionary  code  based  on  the  1800  Wilmington 
edition  of  the  ubiquitous  Entick’s.  On  October  8,  1806,  as  Wilkinson  waited  in 
camp  at  Natchitoches,  Louisiana,  a messenger  arrived  with  a cipher  letter  in 
this  system  from  Burr  dated  July  22,  in  which  he  outlined  his  final  plans  for 
the  great  adventure. 

Its  exact  wording  will  never  be  known.  Wilkinson  erased,  altered,  and 
redeciphered  it  time  and  again  to  suit  his  varying  conveniences.  In  its  final 
version,  it  began:  “Your  letter  post  marked  13th  May  is  received.  1 have  at 
length  263. Bed  176.3.  and  have  35.3  93.10ed.  . . It  went  on  to  tell  how 
Burr  was  planning  to  move  westward  down  the  Ohio  and  the  Mississippi  with 
about  500  or  1,000  men  to  meet  Wilkinson  and  “there  to  determine  whether 
it  will  be  expedient  in  the  first  instance  to  seize  on  or  pass  by  Baton  Rouge.” 
Wilkinson  used  it,  not  to  meet  Burr,  but  to  double-cross  him.  He  sent  one  of 
the  decipherments  to  President  Thomas  Jefferson,  who  promptly  ordered  the 
breakup  of  Burr’s  expedition. 

The  former  Vice  President  was  arrested  and  tried  for  treason,  with  Chief 
Justice  John  Marshall  presiding.  The  letter  formed  one  of  the  chief  exhibits. 
Under  cross-examination,  Wilkinson  brazenly  admitted  that  he  had  changed 
the  document  to  save  himself  from  implication.  At  one  point  he  averred  that 
the  decipherment  was  hasty,  inaccurate,  and  done  piecemeal;  at  another,  that 
it  was  a careful,  tedious,  and  lengthy  bit  of  work.  This  sort  of  vacillation  by 
the  chief  prosecution  witness  threw  a reasonable  doubt  on  Burr’s  guilt,  and 
the  jury  acquitted  him.  But  the  court  of  public  opinion,  roused  by  the  evidence 
of  the  cryptogram,  convicted  him.  For  the  remainder  of  his  life  Burr  could 


187 


The  Era  of  the  Black  Chambers 

never  expunge  the  stain  on  his  name  that  his  enciphered  message  had  helped 
place  there. 

During  these  formative  years,  the  black  chambers  of  Europe  did  not 
disdain  to  read  the  communications  of  the  fledgling  nation  just  because  it  was 
weak  and  far  away.  As  early  as  1777  Britain’s  black  chamber  was  developing 
American  letters  in  secret  ink:  the  British  chemists  marked  two  of  them, 
apparently  sent  between  Paris  and  London,  with  “all  written  in  white  ink’ 
and  “R,.l 5th.”  One  has  Benjamin  Franklin’s  name  in  the  margin. 

The  following  year,  a letter  from  an  American  businessman  in  London  to 
Franklin’s  secretary  in  Paris  was  solved.  In  1780,  Francis  Willes,  Bishop 
Willes’  son,  solved  a packet  of  letters  from  the  Marquis  de  Lafayette,  then  in 
Philadelphia,  to  France’s  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,  the  Count  de  Vergennes. 
One  dispatch,  of  May  20,  in  an  extensive  two-part  nomenclator,  proved  to  be 
a long  and  informative  report  summarizing  the  overall  situation  as  Lafayette 
saw  it— the  Continental  currency  has  greatly  depreciated,  New  York  can  be 
taken  if  the  French  troops  arrive  in  time,  Washington  is  thinking  of  conquer- 
ing Canada,  and  the  ability,  honesty,  and  constancy  of  “mes  amis  Ameri- 
cains.”  The  packet  had  been  thrown  overboard  when  the  vessel  carrying  it 
was  captured  by  the  British,  but  some  tars  jumped  in  and  retrieved  it.  The 
solutions  were  shown  to  King  George  III,  who  may  have  obtained  thereby 
some  valuable  clues  as  to  how  to  conduct  his  American  war. 

Later  the  Decyphering  Branch  read  correspondence  between  American 
ministers  in  London,  The  Hague,  and  Berlin — in  the  latter  city  a future  Presi- 
dent named  John  Quincy  Adams— between  July,  1798,  and  February,  1 800.  The 
letters,  enciphered  in  a homophonic  substitution,  seem  to  have  been  solved 
in  retrospective  solutions.  In  1841,  Britain  lifted  the  flap  of  a two-part  U.S. 
nomenclator  and  peeked  at  the  American  minister  to  Spain  reporting  on  the 
successful  conclusion  of  financial  negotiations  with  that  country. 

By  then  the  Decyphering  Branch  had  only  two  members.  Of  the  three 
grandsons  of  Bishop  Willes  who  had  joined  in  the  1790s,  just  one,  Francis 
Willes,  carried  on  the  family  tradition.  His  brother  William  had  assisted  only 
briefly,  and  his  other  brother,  Edward,  had  died  in  1812,  the  last  to  hold  the 
title  of  Decypherer.  Francis  became  so  overworked  that  he  enrolled  his 
nephew,  the  Reverend  Mr.  William  Willes  Lovell  (apparently  no  relation  to 
James  Lovell)  as  assistant. 

Nor  was  France  idle.  On  September  26,  1812,  the  American  minister, 
writing  to  President  Madison,  carefully  enciphered  the  names  of  two  French 
officials  who  were  backing  his  claims  against  Napoleon  and  made  a point 
of  asking  the  President  to  keep  them  confidential.  But  the  cryptologic 
descendants  of  the  Rossignols  had  their  own  way  of  finding  out  for  the  Little 
Emperor  that  the  two  were  Cambaceres  and  Talleyrand. 

These  were  the  dying  gasps  of  the  black  chambers.  The  winds  of  change, 
stirred  up  in  part  by  the  example  of  the  nation  whose  codes  were  being  solved. 


188 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


in  part  by  the  machines  of  the  Industrial  Revolution,  freshened  into  the 
political  gales  of  the  1840s  which  blew  down  most  of  Europe’s  remaining 
absolutism  and  the  totalitarian  agencies  that  propped  it  up.  Europe’s  new 
birth  of  freedom  tolerated  no  government  opening  of  mail.  In  England,  a 
tremendous  public  and  parliamentary  outcry  over  the  surreptitious  opening 
of  letters  forced  the  government  to  discontinue  the  interception  of  diplomatic

correspondence  in  June  of  1844.  That  October  the  government  dissolved  the 
Decyphering  Branch,  pensioning  off  Willes  and  Lovell.  In  Austria,  the 
Geheime  Kabinets-Kanzlei  closed  its  doors  in  1848.  In  France,  the  Cabinet 
Noir,  which  had  been  withering  ever  since  the  Revolution,  passed  away  as 
well  in  that  convulsive  year.  And  in  that  same  decade,  the  same  vast 
social  forces  that  ended  the  era  of  the  black  chambers  simultaneously 
fostered  an  invention  that  transformed  cryptography.

THE  CONTRIBUTION  OF  THE 
DILETTANTES 


the  telegraph  made  cryptography  what  it  is  today.  Samuel  F.  B.  Morse 
sent  “What  hath  God  wrought!”  in  1844.  The  next  year  his  lawyer  and  pro- 
motional agent,  Francis  O.  J.  Smith,  published  a commercial  code  entitled 
The  Secret  Corresponding  Vocabulary;  Adapted  for  Use  to  Morse's  Electro- 
Magnetic  Telegraph,  in  whose  preface  he  declared  that  “secrecy  in  correspon- 
dence, is  far  the  most  important  consideration.”  This  was  provided  by  a 
superencipherment.  Nine  years  later,  an  article  on  telegraphy  in  England’s 
Quarterly  Review  likewise  emphasized  the  primacy  of  security: 

Means  should  also  be  taken  to  obviate  one  great  objection,  at  present  felt 
with  respect  to  sending  private  communications  by  telegraph — the  violation  of 
all  secrecy — for  in  any  case  half-a-dozen  people  must  be  cognizant  of  every 
word  addressed  by  one  person  to  another.  The  clerks  of  the  English  Telegraph 
Company  are  sworn  to  secrecy, but  we  often  write  things  that  it  would  be  intoler- 
able to  see  strangers  read  before  our  eyes.  This  is  a grievous  fault  in  the  telegraph, 
and  it  must  be  remedied  by  some  means  or  other.  ...  At  all  events,  some  simple 
yet  secure  cipher,  easily  acquired  and  easily  read,  should  be  introduced,  by  which 
means  messages  might  to  all  intents  and  purposes  be  “sealed”  to  any  person 
except  the  recipient. 

As  the  most  exciting  invention  of  the  first  half  of  the  century,  the  telegraph 
stirred  as  much  interest  in  its  day  as  Sputnik  did  in  its.  The  great  and  widely 
felt  need  for  secrecy  awakened  the  latent  interest  in  ciphers  that  so  many  people 
seem  to  have,  and  kindled  a new  interest  in  many  others.  Dozens  of  persons 
tried  to  dream  up  their  own  unbreakable  ciphers.  Nearly  all  were  amateurs, 
the  professionals  (except  for  a few  code  clerks)  having  lost  their  jobs  when 
the  black  chambers  were  abolished.  A surprising  number  of  these  dabblers 
were  intellectual  and  political  leaders  of  the  day  who  beamed  their  powerful 
and  original  minds  on  the  engrossing  field  of  cryptology.  Their  contributions 
enriched  it  with  dozens  of  new  cipher  systems. 

As  businessmen  and  the  public  used  the  telegraph  more  and  more,  they 
found  that  their  fears  about  lack  of  privacy  were  exaggerated.  The  clerks 
dealt  impersonally  with  the  messages.  The  telegraph  companies  respected 

189 


190 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


their  confidentiality.  And  commercial  codes  like  Smith’s,  which  replaced 
words  and  phrases  by  single  codewords  or  codenumbers  to  cut  telegraph  tolls, 
afforded  sufficient  security  for  most  business  transactions  by  simply  pre- 
cluding an  at-sight  comprehension  of  the  meaning.  The  brokers  and  traders 
soon  realized  that  the  main  advantage  of  these  codes  was  their  economy. 

Smith’s  pioneering  venture  was  followed  by  dozens,  then  scores,  then 
hundreds  of  commercial  codes.  Though  a few  had  as  many  as  100,000  entries 
and  some  specialized  ones  only  a few  hundred,  considerations  of  optimum 
manageability  and  selling  price  concentrated  most  in  the  neighborhood  of 
Smith’s  50,000-entry  size.  They  improved  on  his  in  two  ways.  They  provided 
dictionary  words  as  codewords  instead  of  the  letter-and-number  groups  that 
he  had  used.  It  was  easier,  cheaper,  and  more  reliable  to  send  albacore  to 
mean  alone  than  the  a.  1 645  of  Smith’s  Vocabulary.  And  they  greatly  increased 
the  number  of  phrases,  thereby  raising  their  toll-saving  potential.  Smith  listed 
only  67  phrases,  collected  on  a single  page,  compared  to  his  50,000  words ; 
later  codes  had  10  or  20  times  as  many  phrases  as  individual  words. 

Government  ministries  used  the  telegraph,  too.  At  first  they  must  have 
encoded  with  their  nomenclators.  But  although  secrecy  was  paramount  for 
them,  they  liked  the  telegraphic  economy  of  a large  code — especially  as  they 
telegraphed  more  and  more.  So  when  the  time  arrived  to  compile  a new 
nomenclator,  they  abandoned  that  form,  copied  the  commercial  form,  and 
produced  a full-fledged  code.  The  nomenclators  had  had  their  1,-  or  2,000 
codenumbers  in  mixed  order,  but  the  war  and  foreign  ministries  balked  at  the 
expense  of  drawing  up  a 50,000-entry  code  in  two  parts,  and  they  had  no 
professional  cryptanalysts  to  warn  them  of  the  danger  of  the  one-part  format. 
They  relied  for  security  upon  small  editions,  big  safes,  extensive  lexicon 
(large  codes  are  harder  to  break  than  small  ones,  other  things  being  equal), 
and  superencipherment,  retaining  codenumbers  to  facilitate  this  instead  of 
switching  to  codewords.  This  evolution  was  essentially  complete  by  the  1860s. 
The  large,  one-part  code  had  replaced  the  small,  two-part  nomenclator  in 
high-level  military  and  diplomatic  cryptography. 

Meanwhile,  the  telegraph,  author  of  this  development,  was  creating  some- 
thing new  in  war — signal  communications,  or  voluminous  command  and 
reconnaissance  messages.  Of  course  such  messages  had  existed  before,  with 
torches,  pigeons,  and  couriers,  but  in  so  rarefied  a form  that  they  were  not 
even  called  “signal  communications.’’  The  telegraph  enabled  commanders, 
for  the  first  time  in  history,  to  exert  instantaneous  and  continuous  control  over 
great  masses  of  men  spread  over  large  areas.  It  filled  a need,  for  universal 
military  conscription  had  begun  to  raise  such  armies  to  fight  the  nationalistic 
warfare  of  democracies  (as  contrasted  with  the  small,  professional  armies  that 
fought  the  dynastic  wars  of  kings),  the  new  railroad  transported  these  large 
forces  rapidly  over  great  distances,  and  the  industrial  society  supported  them. 
These  developments,  together  with  the  breech-loading  gun,  brought  about  the 
era  of  modern  warfare.

The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes 

No  longer  could  a general  sit  horseback  atop  a hill  and  survey  the  battle, 
like  Napoleon  or  Hannibal,  sending  messengers  to  hand-carry  instructions  to 
wheel  or  to  counterattack.  The  forces  engaged  were  too  numerous,  the  field 
too  vast.  He  had  to  work  from  a command  post  far  in  the  rear,  following  the 
progress  of  the  battle  by  telegraph  on  maps  that  showed  more  than  his  naked 
eye  could  ever  see.  He  could  issue  orders  by  telegraph  that  would  coordinate 
the  movement  of  one  out-of-sight  wing  with  that  of  another,  bring  up  reserves 
to  block  an  enemy  charge,  order  up  food  and  ammunition  in  a hurry.  The 
number  of  messages  grew  correspondingly.  The  command  post  became 
virtually  a communications  center. 

These  tactical  messages  required  protection:  telegraph  wires  could  be 
tapped.  Neither  the  old  nomenclator  nor  the  new  code  would  do.  They  were 
too  easy  to  capture  in  combat,  too  hard  to  reissue  quickly  and  frequently  to 
the  numerous  and  widespread  telegraph  posts.  Signal  officers  turned  away 
from  them.  They  looked  instead  to  that  neglected  child  of  cryptography,  the 
cipher.  Ciphers  could  be  printed  cheaply  on  a single  sheet  of  paper  and  dis- 
tributed with  ease.  Secrecy  was  based  upon  variable  keys,  so  capture  of  the 
general  system  and  even  of  one  of  the  keys  would  not  compromise  all  an 
army’s  secret  messages.  Solutions  would  be  prevented  by  rapid  key  changes. 
Ciphers  were  ideal  for  battle-zone  messages,  and  the  first  of  the  modern  wars, 
the  American  Civil  War,  used  them  for  just  that.  Thus  was  born  a new  genre 
in  cryptography : the  field  cipher. 

The  first  one  was  waiting  in  the  wings.  This  was  polyalphabetic  substitution, 
in  the  form  of  the  straight-alphabet  Vigenere  with  short  repeating  keyword. 
The  old  objections  to  its  use,  which  boiled  down  to  the  impossibility  of  cor- 
recting a garbled  dispatch  quickly  enough,  vanished  with  the  telegraph.  It 
fulfilled  the  requirements  of  noncompromisability  of  the  general  system  and 
of  ease  of  key  changes.  Moreover,  it  had  the  reputation  of  being  unbreakable 
— which,  if  its  cryptograms  were  not  divided  into  words,  it  largely  was.  The 
military  adopted  it  at  once. 

Then,  in  1863,  a retired  Prussian  infantry  major  discovered  the  general 
solution  for  the  periodic  polyalphabetic  substitution.  At  one  stroke  he 
demolished  the  only  impregnable  structure  in  cryptography.  Signal  officers, 
compelled  to  provide  secure  communications,  hunted  frantically  for  new  field 
ciphers.  They  found  many  good  ideas  in  the  writings  of  the  dilettante  crypto- 
graphers who  had  proposed  ciphers  for  the  protection  of  private  messages. 
Soon  some  of  these  systems  were  serving  in  the  various  armies  of  Europe  and 
the  Americas.  More  ideas  came  from  army  officers  who  had  studied  crypto- 
graphy in  the  courses  in  signal  communication  that  the  national  military 
academies,  such  as  St.  Cyr,  had  added  in  the  mid-1800s.  Inevitably,  crypt- 
analysts—who  were  either  amateurs  or  soldiers  with  a professional  interest, 
for  full  professionals  there  were  none — replied  with  new  techniques  for 
breaking  the  new  ciphers.  From  the  slow  crawl  of  nomenclator  days,  when 
the  introduction  of  a special  group  meaning  Disregard  the  preceding  group 


192 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


would  constitute  a remarkable  technical  advance,  the  race  between  offense 
and  defense  in  cryptology  accelerated  to  its  modern  pace. 

The  history  of  cryptology  from  the  decade  that  saw  both  the  death  of  the 
black  chambers  and  the  birth  of  the  telegraph  to  World  War  1 is  thus  a story 
of  internal  development.  Without  Rossignols  or  Willeses,  and  without  major 
wars  or  diplomatic  struggles,  cryptology  could  not  influence  world  events, 
and,  except  for  one  or  two  unusual  cases,  it  did  not.  The  telegraph  launched 
this  evolution  of  cryptology.  It  broke  the  monopoly  of  the  nomenclator.  The 
nomenclator  had  reigned  for  450  years  as  a general,  all-purpose  system,  but  it 
could  not  meet  the  new  requirements  either  of  high-level  diplomatic  or  military 
communications  or  of  low-level  signal  communications,  which  the  telegraph 
had  engendered.  Each  called  for  its  own  kind  of  cryptosystem,  a specialized 
one.  Signal  officers  ranked  these  systems  in  a hierarchy,  rising  from  the  simple 
and  flexible  and  easily  solved  to  the  extensive  and  hard  to  solve.  The  telegraph 
thus  stimulated  the  invention  of  many  new  ciphers  and,  by  reaction,  many 
new  methods  of  cryptanalysis,  and  compelled  their  arrangement  in  a scale  of 
complexity. 

Many  of  these  ciphers  and  techniques  have  become  classic  and  are  in  use 
today.  Moreover,  cryptography  still  functions  through  a hierarchy  and  em- 
ploys a multitude  of  special  systems.  The  telegraph  thereby  furnished  crypto- 
graphy with  the  structure  and  the  content  that  it  still  has.  It  made  it  what  it  is 
today. 

All  these  things  have  antecedents,  and  just  as  the  telegraph  itself  did,  so 
were  there  precursors  of  the  cryptographic  systems  that  it  engendered.  What 
may  be  the  earliest  printed  forerunner  of  the  codes  of  today  appeared  at 
Hartford  in  1805.  A Dictionary;  to  Enable  Any  Two  Persons  to  Maintain  a 
Correspondence,  With  a Secrecy,  Which  Is  Impossible  for  Any  Other  Person  to 
Discover  was  a small  book  listing  words  and  syllables  in  alphabetical  order; 
these  were  to  be  numbered  serially  by  the  correspondents,  omitting  one 
number  in  every  ten  so  that  no  two  sets  of  correspondents  would  have  the 
same  code  equivalents. 

One  cipher  system  invented  before  the  telegraph  was  so  far  ahead  of  its 
time,  and  so  much  in  the  spirit  of  the  later  inventions,  that  it  deserves  to  be 
classed  with  them.  Indeed,  it  deserves  the  front  rank  among  them,  for  this 
system  was  beyond  doubt  the  most  remarkable  of  all.  So  well  conceived  was 
it  that  today,  more  than  a century  and  a half  of  rapid  technological  progress 
after  its  invention,  it  remains  in  active  use. 

But  then  it  was  invented  by  a remarkable  man,  a well-known  writer, 
agriculturalist,  bibliophile,  architect,  diplomat,  gadgeteer,  and  statesman 
named  Thomas  Jefferson.  He  called  it  his  “wheel  cypher,”  and  it  seems  likely 
that  he  invented  it  either  during  1790  to  1793  or  during  1797  to  1800.  During 
the  first  period  he  was  America’s  first  Secretary  of  State,  and  the  responsibili- 
ties of  conducting  foreign  policy,  the  need  to  protect  communications  from

The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes 

England  and  France,  the  divided  American  cabinet,  the  spirit  of  invention 
that  he  found  as  administrator  of  the  patent  law,  all  spurred  his  own  natural 
inventiveness;  he  was  then  also  in  contact  with  Dr.  Robert  Patterson,  a 
mathematician  of  the  University  of  Pennyslvania  and  vice  president  of  the 
American  Philosophical  Society,  who  was  interested  in  ciphers.  During  the 
later  period,  he  was  again  in  close  contact  with  Patterson,  who  in  1801  sent 
him  a cipher.  Jefferson’s  explanation  of  the  wheel  cypher  is  characteristically 
clear  and  economical: 

Turn  a cylinder  of  white  wood  of  about  2.  Inches  diameter  & 6.  or  8. 1.  long, 
bore  through  its  center  a hole  sufficient  to  recieve  an  iron  spindle  or  axis  of  1/8  or 
1/41.  diam.  divide  the  periphery  into  26.  equal  parts  (for  the  26.  letters  of  the 
alphabet)  and,  with  a sharp  point,  draw  parallel  lines  through  all  the  points  of 
division  from  one  end  to  the  other  of  the  cylinder,  & trace  those  lines  with  ink  to 
make  them  plain,  then  cut  the  cylinder  crosswise  into  pieces  of  about  1/6  of  an 
inch  thick,  they  will  resemble  back-gammon  men  with  plane  sides,  number  each 
of  them,  as  they  are  cut  off,  on  one  side,  that  they  may  be  arrangeable  in  any 
order  you  please,  on  the  periphery  of  each,  and  between  the  black  lines,  put  all 
the  letters  of  the  alphabet,  not  in  their  established  order,  but  jumbled  & without 
order,  so  that  no  two  shall  be  alike,  now  string  them  in  their  numerical  order  on 
an  iron  axis,  one  end  of  which  has  a head,  and  the  other  a nut  and  screw;  the  use 
of  which  is  to  hold  them  firm  in  any  given  position  when  you  chuse  it.  they  are 
now  ready  for  use,  your  correspondent  having  a similar  cylinder,  similarly 
arranged. 

Suppose  I have  to  cypher  this  phrase.  “Your  favor  of  the  22d  is  recieved.” 
I turn  the  Is.1  wheel  till  the  letter  y.  presents  itself 


I turn  the  2d  & place  it’s  . . o.  by  the  side  of  the  y.  of  the  Is-*  wheel. 

I turn  the  3d  & place  it’s  . . u.  by  the  side  of  the  o.  of  the  2d 

41!1 r.  by  the  side  of  the  u.  of  the  3d 

51!1 f.  by  the  side  of  the  r.  of  the  4'h 

6‘.h a.  by  the  side  of  the  f.  of  the  5th 


and  so  on  till  I have  got  all  the  words  of  the  phrase  arranged  in  one  line,  fix  them 
with  the  screw,  you  will  observe  that  the  cylinder  then  presents  25.  other  lines  of 
letters,  not  in  any  regular  series,  but  jumbled,  & without  order  or  meaning, 
copy  any  one  of  them  in  the  letter  to  your  correspondent,  when  he  recieves  it, 
he  takes  his  cylinder  and  arranges  the  wheels  so  as  to  present  the  same  jumbled 
letters  in  the  same  order  in  one  line,  he  then  fixes  them  with  his  screw,  and 
examines  the  other  25.  lines  and  finds  one  of  them  presenting  him  these  letters: 
“your  favor  of  the  22  is  recieved.”  which  he  writes  down,  as  the  others 
will  be  jumbled  & have  no  meaning,  he  cannot  mistake  the  true  one  intended,  so 
proceed  with  every  other  portion  of  the  letter,  numbers  had  better  be  represented 
by  letters  with  dots  over  them;  as  for  instance  by  the  6.  vowels  & 4.  liquids, 
because  if  the  periphery  were  divided  into  36.  instead  of  26.  lines  for  the 
numerical,  as  well  as  alphabetical  characters,  it  would  increase  the  trouble  of 
finding  the  letters  on  the  wheels. 

When  the  cylinder  of  wheels  is  fixed,  with  the  jumbled  alphabets  on  their 
peripheries,  by  only  changing  the  order  of  the  wheels  in  the  cylinder,  an  immense 


194 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


variety  of  different  cyphers  may  be  produced  for  different  correspondents, 
for  whatever  be  the  number  of  wheels,  if  you  take  all  the  natural  numbers  from 
unit  to  that  inclusive,  & multiply  them  successively  into  one  another,  their  pro- 
duct will  be  the  number  of  different  combinations  of  which  the  wheels  are  sus- 
ceptible, and  consequently  of  the  different  cyphers  they  may  form  for  different 
correspondents,  entirely  unintelligible  to  each  other.  . . . 

Jefferson  went  on  to  say  that  if  the  cylinder  be  six  inches  long  (“which 
probably  will  be  a convenient  length,  as  it  may  be  spanned  between  the  middle 
finger  & thumb  of  the  left  hand,  while  in  use”)  the  number  of  wheels  would 
total  36,  and  the  number  of  ways  in  which  they  can  be  strung  on  the  spindle 
to  form  different  ciphers  for  different  correspondents  would  come  to  36  fac- 
torial, or  1 x 2 x 3 x ...  x 35  x 36,  which  Jefferson  calculated  almost  exactly 


as  “372  with  39  cyphers  [zeros]  added  to  it.”  In  fact,  36  factorial  is 
37 1 ,993,326,789,901 ,21 7,467,999,448, 1 50,835,200,000,000. 

Jefferson’s  wheel  cypher  was  far  and  away  the  most  advanced  devised  in  its 
day.  It  seems  to  have  come  out  of  the  blue  rather  than  as  a result  of  mature 
reflection  upon  cryptology.  Jefferson  continued  to  use  the  nomenclator  while 
he  was  Secretary  of  State,  and  the  only  indication  of  any  cryptographic 
originality  is  his  selection  of  a Vigenere  as  the  official  cipher  for  the  Lewis  and 
Clark  expedition.  Moreover,  on  March  22,  1802,  he  wrote  Dr.  Patterson, 
who  had  submitted  a cipher  to  Jefferson  as  president  of  the  American 
Philosophical  Society,  that  “I  have  thoroughly  considered  your  cypher,  and 
find  it  so  much  more  convenient  in  practice  than  my  wheel  cypher,  that  1 am

The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes 

proposing  it  to  the  Secretary  of  state  for  use  in  his  office,”  a month  later 
adding  that  “We  are  introducing  your  cypher  into  our  foreign  correspon- 
dences.” Patterson’s  cipher  was  a columnar  transposition  with  nulls  at  the 
heads  of  the  columns,  of  a security  in  no  way  comparable  to  Jefferson’s.  That 
Jefferson  did  not  see  this  does  not  speak  too  highly  of  his  cryptologic  percep- 
tions. 

Had  the  President  recommended  his  own  system  to  Secretary  of  State 
James  Madison,  he  would  have  endowed  his  country  with  a method  of  secret 
communication  that  would  almost  certainly  have  withstood  any  cryptanalytic 
attack  of  those  days.  Instead  he  appears  to  have  filed  and  forgotten  it.  It  was 
not  rediscovered  among  his  papers  in  the  Library  of  Congress  until  1922, 
coincidentally  the  year  the  U.S.  Army  adopted  an  almost  identical  device 
that  had  been  independently  invented.  Later,  other  branches  of  the  American 
government  used  the  Jefferson  system,  generally  slightly  modified,  and  it  often 
defeated  the  best  efforts  of  the  20th-century  cryptanalysts  who  tried  to  break 
it  down!  To  this  day  the  Navy  uses  it.  This  is  a remarkable  longevity.  So 
important  is  his  system  that  it  confers  upon  Jefferson  the  title  of  Father  of 
American  Cryptography.  And  so  original  is  it  that  it  sets  Jefferson  upon  a 
pedestal  far  more  prominent  than  those  accorded  to  men  like  Vigenere  and 
Cardano,  whose  names  are  usually  thought  to  be  household  words  in  the  history 
of  secret  writing. 

In  1817,  another  American  constructed  a cryptograph  that,  like  Jefferson’s, 
introduced  a new  principle  into  cryptology.  Colonel  Decius  Wadsworth,  then 
49,  was  a Yale  graduate  who  twice  quit  the  Army  (once  to  seek  his  fortune  in 
the  fur  trade)  and  twice  rejoined  when  wars  with  France  and  Britain  threatened ; 
how  and  why  he  became  interested  in  secret  writing  remains  unknown. 
But  his  attraction  to  mechanical  devices  may  well  have  fostered  his  friendship 
with  Eli  Whitney,  whose  cotton  gin  he  admired  and  whose  muskets  with  inter- 
changeable parts  he  inspected  and  approved  for  use  by  the  Army.  When,  in 
1812,  he  became  the  first  chief  of  ordnance  of  the  U.S.  Army,  he  again  backed 
Whitney  strongly.  Illness  forced  him  to  resign  this  post  and  his  commission 
in  June  of  1821,  and  Whitney,  remembering,  brought  him  to  New  Haven. 
Here  Whitney  could  visit  him  daily  and  ensure  his  good  care.  But  on  Novem- 
ber 8 Wadsworth  died. 

His  innovation  was  to  make  the  plaintext  and  ciphertext  alphabets 
different  lengths.  The  device  in  which  he  realized  this  is  a brass  cipher  disk 
set  in  a polished  wooden  case  six  and  a half  inches  in  diameter  and  almost 
three  inches  high.  It  may  have  been  built  for  him  by  Whitney.  Its  outer  alpha- 
bet consists  of  the  26  letters  plus  the  digits  from  2 to  8 for  a total  of  33  elements; 
the  inner  alphabet  consists  of  just  the  26  letters.  A little  brass  plate  marks  the 
one  point  around  the  two  rings  of  alphabets  at  which  they  are  in  exact  con- 
junction; two  apertures  in  this  plate  expose  the  two  letters,  one  on  each  ring, 
that  are  to  be  taken  as  plaintext  and  cipher  equivalents.  (No  records  indicate 


196 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


which  alphabet  Wadsworth  meant  to  serve  as  plain  and  which  as  cipher;  this 
account  assumes  the  inner  to  be  the  plain  alphabet.)  These  two  rings  of  the 
disk,  both  of  which  revolve,  are  connected  to  one  another  inside  the  case  by 
two  gears,  one  with  33,  the  other  with  26  teeth.  The  letters  and  numbers  of  the 
outer  ring  are  stamped  on  brass  plugs  which  may  be  assembled  in  any  order. 
Before  enciphering,  the  correspondents  agree  on  a mixed  sequence  for  the 
ciphertext  ring  and  on  a starting  juxtaposition  for  the  two  sections,  such  as, 
say,  R in  the  outer  disk  opposite  V in  the  inner;  the  gears  may  be  disengaged 
to  permit  this  setting. 

Suppose,  now,  that  the  correspondents  are  in  the  Peruvian  wool  trade 
and  that  their  message  begins  with  llama — a word  admirably  suited  to 
demonstrate  the  cryptographic  workings  of  their  device.  The  encipherer 
will  spin  the  inner  disk  by  means  of  a little  knob  on  it  until  the  first  / 
appears  in  the  inner  aperture  of  the  brass  plate;  he  will  write  down  the 
letter  in  the  outer  aperture  as  the  first  cipher  letter.  Then  he  will  turn  the  inner 
disk  until  1 appears  again  in  the  inner  aperture.  The  gears  will  have  transmitted 
this  motion  to  the  outer  ring,  but  because  of  the  difference  in  the  size  of  the 
alphabets,  the  outer  disk  will  have  gone  through  only  26/33rds  of  a revolu- 
tion while  the  inner  has  completed  a full  revolution.  Consequently,  the  second 
ciphertext  letter  will  stand  seven  places  farther  forward  in  the  outer  alphabet 
than  the  first,  even  though  both  represent  the  same  plaintext  letter.  If  this 
process  is  kept  up,  the  cipher  equivalents  for  / would  not  begin  to  repeat  until 
all  33  letters  and  digits  of  the  outer  alphabet  had  been  used.  This  is  because 
26  and  33  have  no  factors  in  common  to  bring  them  into  conjunction 
earlier. 

The  encipherment  thus  constitutes  a progressive  system  in  which  all  the 
cipher  alphabets  are  used,  like  Trithemius’  original  polyalphabetic  encipher- 
ment. But  the  disparity  in  length  between  the  plain  and  the  cipher  alphabets 
results  in  two  crucial  differences.  One  is  that  the  Wadsworth  device  employs 
33  cipher  alphabets  instead  of  the  24  of  Trithemius.  The  other  is  that  these 
alphabets  are  brought  into  play,  not  one  right  after  another,  but  in  an  irregular 
manner — a manner  that  depends  on  the  letters  of  the  plaintext.  This  irregular- 
ity defends  the  cipher  much  better  than  Trithemius’  regular  progression. 

Knowledge  of  Wadsworth’s  device,  which  could  not  have  been  widely 
disseminated  even  while  he  lived,  faded  completely  soon  after  he  died.  Con- 
sequently, credit  for  the  discovery  of  the  principle  of  sliding  two  alphabets  of 
different  lengths  against  one  another  has  usually  been  awarded  to  a widely 
known  British  scientist  who  independently  devised  a mechanism  based  on 
it. 

Charles  Wheatstone  had  a remarkably  fertile  mind.  He  constructed  an 
electric  telegraph  before  Morse  did,  invented  the  concertina,  improved  the 
dynamo,  studied  underwater  telegraphy,  produced  some  of  the  first  stereo- 
scopic drawings,  published  half  a dozen  papers  on  acoustics,  discussed 
phonetics  and  hypothetical  speaking  machines  in  print,  conducted  numerous

electrical  experiments,  and  popularized  a method  for  the  extremely  accurate 
measurement  of  electrical  resistance  now  in  frequent  use  and  called  the 
“Wheatstone  bridge.”  His  work  was  highly  enough  regarded  for  him  to  be 
elected  a fellow  of  the  Royal  Society  and  to  be  knighted.  He  was  nominally 
professor  of  experimental  philosophy  at  King’s  College,  London,  but  was  so 
excessively  shy  that  he  hardly  ever  actually  lectured.  Around  1860,  in  his  late 
fifties,  he  solved  a long  cipher  letter  of  Charles  I.  It  consisted  of  seven  folio 
pages  filled  with  numerals,  each  page  signed  at  the  top  by  the  king;  it  proved 
to  be  instructions  in  French  for  the  Sieur  de  Goffe,  enciphered  in  a small 
one-part  nomenclator  (a  = 12,  13,  14,  15,  16,  17;  b = 18,  19;  France  = 
478). 

Wheatstone  first  displayed  his  Cryptograph  at  the  Exposition  Universelle 
at  Paris  in  1867.  It  differed  only  in  detail  from  Wadsworth’s.  The  Wheatstone 
apparatus  had  an  outer  plaintext  alphabet  of  27  elements — the  26  letters  in 


The  Wheatstone  cipher  machine,  with  plaintext  alphabet  outside,  cipher  inside 

normal  order  plus  a blank  for  a word  space— and  an  inner,  mixed  ciphertext 
alphabet  of  the  26  letters.  Over  these  alphabets  swung  two  clocklike  hands, 
which  were  connected  by  gears.  “At  the  commencement  [of  encipherment],” 
Wheatstone’s  instructions  read,  “the  long  hand  must  correspond  with  the 
blank  of  the  outer  circle  and  the  short  hand  be  directly  under  it.  The  long  hand 
must  be  brought  successively  to  the  letters  of  the  despatch  (outer  circle),  and 
the  letters  indicated  on  the  inner  circle  by  the  short  hand  must  be  written 
down.  At  the  termination  of  each  word  the  long  hand  must  be  brought  to  the 
blank,  and  the  letter  indicated  by  the  short  hand  also  written  down.  By  this 
arrangement,  the  cipher  is  continuous,  no  intimation  being  given  of  the 
separation  of  the  words.  Whenever  a double  letter  occurs,  some  unused  letter 
(as,  for  instance,  q)  must  always  be  substituted  for  the  repeated  letter;  or  the

latter  may  be  omitted.”  The  variation  in  the  length  of  the  two  alphabets 
means  that  as  the  larger  hand  is  completing  a revolution,  the  smaller  is  already 
one  cell  into  its  second. 

The  device’s  simplicity,  automaticity,  apparent  insolubility,  and  compact- 
ness impressed  many  visitors  to  the  exposition.  One  of  them  was  Colonel 
Laussedat  of  the  French  commission  that  looked  for  military  possibilities 
among  the  exhibits;  he  reported  favorably  on  the  Wheatstone  Cryptograph, 
even  to  the  point  of  stating  that  it  “assures  the  most  absolute  secrecy.” 

In  fact,  a cryptogram  produced  by  this  instrument  is  less  secure  than  a 
Wadsworth  because  the  Wheatstone  difference  in  alphabet  sizes  amounts  to 
only  one  unit.  As  a result,  a doubled  ciphertext  letter  can  mean  only  that 
their  two  plaintext  letters  represent  letters  in  reverse  alphabetical  order,  such 
as  the  common  digraph  on  or  ts.  These  may  afford  a break  into  the  system. 
Indeed,  this  very  observation  was  made,  and  a solution  elucidated  by  attack- 
ing sentences  as  probably  starting  with  the,  in  an  extremely  perceptive  article 
signed  only  “C.P.B.”  and  published  in  Macmillan's  Magazine  just  four  years 
after  Wheatstone  exhibited  his  apparatus. 

It  is  another  of  the  many  ironies  of  cryptologic  history  that  Wheatstone’s 
name  adheres  to  a device  that  owes  its  priority  to  another  and  that  never 
achieved  importance,  while  a cipher  that  he  did  originate,  and  that  served 
with  distinction  for  many  years,  bears  the  name  of  another.  Wheatstone 
invented  the  cipher  for  secrecy  in  telegraphy,  but  it  carries  the  name  of  his 
friend  Lyon  Playfair,  first  Baron  Playfair  of  St.  Andrews.  A scientist  and 
public  figure  of  Victorian  England,  Playfair  was  at  one  time  or  another 
deputy  speaker  of  the  House  of  Commons,  postmaster  general,  and  president 
of  the  British  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science.  As  a commissioner 
on  the  public  health  of  towns,  he  helped  lay  the  foundations  of  modern 
sanitation.  He  lived  across  London’s  Hammersmith  Bridge  from  Wheatstone. 
Because  both  were  short  and  bespectacled,  they  were  frequently  mistaken  for 
one  another— once  even  by  Lady  Wheatstone.  They  walked  together  on  Sun- 
days and  amused  themselves  by  solving  the  enciphered  personal  messages  in 
the  London  Times.  They  easily  read  the  correspondence  of  an  Oxford  student 
with  his  young  lady  in  London,  and  when  the  student  proposed  an  elopement, 
Wheatstone  inserted  an  advertisement  in  the  same  cipher  remonstrating  with 
her.  There  followed  a frantic  “Dear  Charlie:  Write  no  more.  Our  cipher  is 
discovered!” — and  then  silence. 

Playfair  demonstrated  what  he  called  “Wheatstone’s  newly-discovered 
symmetrical  cipher”  at  a dinner  in  January,  1854,  given  by  the  president  of  the 
governing  council.  Lord  Granville.  One  of  the  guests  was  Queen  Victoria’s 
husband,  Prince  Albert;  another  was  the  Home  Secretary  and  future  Prime 
Minister,  Lord  Palmerston.  Playfair  explained  the  system  to  him,  and,  while 
in  Dublin  a few  days  later,  received  two  short  letters  in  the  cipher  from 
Palmerston  and  Granville,  showing  that  both  had  readily  mastered  it.

Wheatstone,  March  26,  1854

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  cipher  is  the  first  literal  one  in  cryptologic  history  to  be  digraphic* — 
that  is,  to  encipher  two  letters  so  that  the  result  depends  upon  both  together. 
Wheatstone  recognized  that  the  cipher  would  work  as  well  with  a rectangle 
as  with  a square,  but  it  soon  petrified  into  the  latter  form.  Wheatstone  also 
employed  a thoroughly  mixed  cipher  alphabet,  which  he  generated  by  a key- 
word transposition — one  of  the  earliest  instances  of  such  a method.  Beneath 
a keyword  he  would  write  the  remaining  letters  of  the  alphabet,  and  then 
derive  the  mixed  alphabet  by  reading  the  columns  vertically: 

M A G N E T I C 
BDFHJ  KLO 
PQRS  UVWX 
Y Z 

Which  yields:  MBPYADQZGFRNHSEJUTKVILWCOX.  This  im- 
portant feature  soon  slipped  out  of  the  picture  as  the  cipher  fell  to  the  lowest 
common  denominator,  just  like  Vigenere’s.  The  keyword  was  instead  inscribed 
directly  into  a 5 x 5 square  with  the  remaining  letters  of  the  alphabet  follow- 
ing. (I  and  J are  merged  in  a single  cell.)  The  practice  lessened  security  but 
facilitated  operation.  It  may  well  have  been  the  way  Playfair  hastily  con- 
structed a keysquare  based  on  PAFMERSTON  to  illustrate  the  cipher  at 
Granville’s  dinner:

To  encipher,  the  plaintext  is  divided  into  pairs.  Double  letters  occurring 
together  in  a pair  must  be  separated  with  an  x,  so  that  balloon  would  be  en- 
ciphered as  ba  lx  lo  on;  i and  j are  regarded  as  identical,  so  that  adjacent  will 
be  enciphered  as  if  it  were  adiacent.  Now  the  letters  of  each  pair  may  stand  in 
only  three  relationships  to  one  another  with  the  key  square:  the  two  may 
appear  in  the  same  row,  in  the  same  column,  or  in  neither.  Letters  that  fall 
in  the  same  row  are  each  replaced  by  the  letter  to  its  right.  Thus,  am  = le, 
hi  = ik,  os  = nt.  Each  row  is  considered  cyclical,  so  that  the  letter  to  the  right 
of  the  last  letter  in  a row  is  the  first  letter  at  the  left  of  that  row.  Thus,  le  = mp, 
ui  = hk.  Letters  that  appear  in  the  same  column  are  each  replaced  by  the 
letter  beneath  it;  the  cyclical  provision  holds.  Thus,  ac  = sj  (or  si,  as  the 
encipherer  wishes);  of  = fq,  wi  = aw,  br  = hb. 

If  the  plaintext  letters  appear  in  neither  the  same  row  nor  the  same  column, 
each  is  replaced  by  the  letter  that  lies  in  its  own  row  and  stands  in  the  column 
occupied  by  the  other  plaintext  letter.  For  example,  to  encipher  sq , the  en- 
cipherer first  locates  them  in  the  square.  Then  he  runs  across  the  row  of  the 
* Porta’s  digraphic  table  was  not  literal : it  used  signs. 


The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes  201 

first  plaintext  letter  (sj  until  he  meets  the  column  in  which  the  second  plaintext 
letter  (q)  stands : 

. M . 

R 5 T O N 

. F . 

■ • - Q • 

. Y . 

The  letter  at  the  junction  of  row  and  column  (o)  becomes  the  first  cipher  letter. 
Then  the  encipherer  traces  across  the  row  of  the  second  plaintext  letter  (q) 
until  he  intersects  the  column  in  which  the  first  plaintext  letter  stands : 

. A . . . 

. 5 . . . 

. C . . . 

H IJ  K Q U 

. W . . . 

The  letter  at  the  intersection  (i)  becomes  the  second  cipher  letter.  Thus  sq  = oi. 
Other  encipherments  are  af  = mc,  at  = ls,  ed  = lg.  The  letter  in  the  row  of 
the  first  plaintext  letter  is  always  taken  first  to  preserve  the  order  of  the  letters, 
so  that  cl  = da  and  not  ad,  which  would  stand  for  le,  and  we  = za. 

Decipherment  in  this  is  precisely  the  same  as  encipherment:  if  ow  = sy, 
then  sy  = ow.  In  the  other  two  cases,  the  plaintext  letters  are  found  to  the 
left  or  above  the  ciphertext  letters.  Thus,  using  the  same  square,  a ciphertext 
reduces  as  follows: 

MT  TB  BN  ES  WH  TL  MP  TA  LN  NL  NV 

lo  rd  gr  an  vi  lx  le  si  et  te  rz 

The  z at  the  end  is  a null  to  complete  the  final  digraph. 

Wheatstone  and  Playfair  explained  the  cipher  to  the  Under  Secretary  of 
the  Foreign  Office,  no  doubt  pointing  out  its  chief  advantage— that  two 
plaintext  pairs  that  have  a letter  in  common  may  not  display  the  slightest 
resemblance  in  ciphertext,  as  le  and  te  above  were  enciphered  to  mp  and  nl. 
Further,  once  mastered,  it  rolls  along  with  remarkable  ease  and  rapidity. 
When  the  Under  Secretary  protested  that  the  system  was  too  complicated, 
Wheatstone  volunteered  to  show  that  three  out  of  four  boys  from  the  nearest 
elementary  school  could  be  taught  it  in  15  minutes.  The  Under  Secretary  put 
him  off.  “That  is  very  possible,”  he  said,  “but  you  could  never  teach  it  to 
attaches.” 

Playfair,  reasoning  that  this  reflected  more  on  the  diplomats  than  on  the 
cipher,  remained  enthusiastic  about  it.  There  were  good  grounds  for  enthusi- 
asm. In  the  first  place,  the  cipher’s  being  digraphic  obliterates  the  single- 
letter characteristics — e,  for  example,  is  no  longer  identifiable  as  an  entity. 
This  undercuts  the  usual  monographic  methods  of  frequency  analysis. 


202 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Secondly,  encipherment  by  digraphs  halves  the  number  of  elements  available 
for  frequency  analysis.  A 100-letter  text  will  have  only  50  cipher  digraphs.  In 
the  third  place,  and  most  important,  the  number  of  digraphs  is  far  greater 
than  the  number  of  single  letters,  and  consequently  the  linguistic  characteris- 
tics spread  over  many  more  elements  and  so  have  much  less  opportunity  to 
individualize  themselves.  There  are  26  letters  but  676  digraphs;  the  two  most 
frequent  English  letters,  e and  t,  average  frequencies  of  12  and  9 per  cent;  the 
two  most  frequent  English  digraphs,  th  and  he,  reach  only  3|  and  2i'per 
cent.  In  other  words,  not  only  are  there  more  units  to  choose  among, 
the  units  are  less  sharply  differentiated.  The  difficulties  are  doubly 
doubled.  J 

These  properties  elevated  the  cipher  above  most  of  its  contemporaries 
purely  on  cryptographic  considerations;  it  was,  probably,  regarded  as  un- 
breakable. Its  many  practical  excellences— no  tables  or  apparatus  required, 
a keyword  that  could  easily  be  remembered  and  changed,  great  simplicity  of 
operation — commended  it  as  a field  cipher.  Playfair  suggested  that  it  be  used  as 
just  that  in  the  impending  Crimean  War  when  he  brought  it  up  at  the  dinner 
with  Prince  Albert.  No  evidence  exists  that  it  was  used  then,  but  there  are 
reports  that  it  served  in  the  Boer  War.  Britain’s  War  Office  apparently  kept 
it  secret  because  it  had  adopted  the  cipher  as  the  British  Army’s  field  system. 
Playfair’s  unselfish  proselytizing  for  his  friend’s  system  unwittingly  cheated 
Wheatstone  of  his  cryptographic  heritage;  though  Playfair  never  claimed  the 
invention  as  his  own,  it  came  to  be  known  in  the  War  Office  as  Playfair’s 
Cipher,  and  his  name  has  stuck  to  it  to  this  day. 

In  England  in  1857,  a 4x 5-inch  card  with  an  alphabet  square  printed  in 
red  and  black  went  on  sale  for  sixpence.  It  was  a new  system  of  secret  writing 
“adapted  for  telegrams  and  postcards,”  the  latter  an  even  newer  form  of 
communication  than  the  telegraph.  Admiral  Sir  Francis  Beaufort,  R.N., 
creator  of  the  Beaufort  scale  with  which  meteorologists  indicate  wind  veloci- 
ties by  numbers  from  0 (calm)  to  12  (hurricane),  had  originated  the  cipher, 
and  his  brother  had  published  it  a few  months  after  the  admiral’s  death.  The 
envelope  for  the  card  carried  the  directions:  “Let  the  key  for  the  foregoing 
table  be  a line  of  poetry  or  the  name  of  some  memorable  person  or  place,  which 
cannot  easily  be  forgotten. . . . Now  look  in  the  side  column  for  the  first 
letter  of  the  text  (?)  and  run  the  eye  across  the  table  until  it  comes  to  the  first 
letter  of  the  key  (v),  then  at  the  top  of  the  column  in  which  v stands  will  be 
found  the  letter  c,”  which  would  be  the  ciphertext. 

The  alphabet  square  is  essentially  the  same  as  the  Vigenere,  except  that  it 
repeats  the  normal  alphabet  on  all  four  sides,  so  that  the  square  extends  27 
letters  across  and  27  down  and  has  a at  all  four  corners.  Its  encipherment 
equals  that  of  a Vigenere  with  reversed  alphabets.  The  system  had  been 
originally  proposed  almost  150  years  before  Beaufort  by  one  Giovanni  Sestri, 
in  a book  published  in  Rome  in  1710  that  had  been  widely  ignored.  But  under 


203 


The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes 

Beaufort’s  name  the  cipher  became  a standard  in  the  repertory  of  cryptology, 
though  its  theoretical  importance  is  minor. 

It  has  also  given  rise  to  a system  called  the  Variant  Beaufort.  In  this,  the 
encipherer  starts,  not  with  the  plaintext  letter  but  with  the  keyletter,  traces  in 
to  the  plaintext  letter,  and  then  turns  upward  to  emerge  at  the  ciphertext. 
Actually,  the  system  might  better  be  called  the  Variant  Vigenere,  for  to 
decipher  it  the  clerk  must  perform  the  operation  that  constitutes  a Vigenere 
encipherment : find  the  keyletter  on  the  side  and  the  ciphertext  letter  at  the 
top,  and  run  into  the  tableau  from  both  until  the  plaintext  letter  is  located  at 
the  junction.  Vigenere  and  Variant  Beaufort  thus  invert  one  another — the 
encipherment  of  one  serves  as  the  decipherment  of  the  other.  True  Beaufort, 
on  the  other  hand,  is  reciprocal  within  itself,  since  the  same  operation 
of  starting  with  the  keyletter,  tracing  in  to  the  known  letter,  and  rising  to 
find  the  unknown  works  for  both  encipherment  and  decipherment. 

Two  years  later,  an  American  who  at  the  time  was  working  for  a stove  and 
foundry  firm  gave,  like  Beaufort,  the  merest  glance  to  cryptology.  Like 
Beaufort,  the  result  was  a single  short  piece  of  work.  But  unlike  the  admiral’s, 
this  work  opened  important  new  vistas  into  untrodden  lands,  and  then  sank 
immediately  into  a cryptologic  obscurity  as  undeserved  as  Beaufort’s  renown. 

The  inventor  was  Pliny  Earle  Chase,  then  39,  who,  after  entering  Harvard 
as  a prodigy  at  15,  taught  in  Philadelphia  for  seven  years  until  his  health 
forced  him  into  less  tiring  work  in  business.  In  1861  he  resumed  teaching, 
becoming  professor  of  natural  science  and  then  professor  of  philosophy  and 
logic  at  Haverford  College  near  Philadelphia.  He  was  an  absorbing  lecturer, 
particularly  in  astronomy,  and  he  collaborated  on  an  arithmetic  textbook 
with  Horace  Mann.  But  perhaps  his  most  notable  accomplishment  was  his 
writing  more  than  250  articles  for  scholarly  magazines.  Among  them  was  the 
one  that  he  penned  in  1859  which  covered  barely  three  pages  in  the  new 
Mathematical  Monthly,  but  which  constitutes  the  first  published  description 
of  fractionating,  or  tomographic,  cipher  systems. 

The  basis  of  these  ciphers  stretches  back  across  the  millennia  to  Polybius, 
the  Greek  historian  of  the  second  century  b.c.  who  distributed  the  alphabet 
in  what  is  even  today  sometimes  called  a “Polybius  square,”  but  more  often 
a “checkerboard.”  Numbers  at  the  side  and  top  indicate  the  row  and  the 
column  of  a given  letter.  Similar  systems  have  cropped  up  throughout 
cryptography.  Some  replace  the  alphabet  by  three  symbols  in  groups  of  three 
(a  = 111,6=  1 12,  c = 113 , d = 121,  etc.),  some  by  two  in  groups  of  five 
{a  = 00000,  b = 00001,  c = 00010,  etc.).  But  no  one  seems  to  have  seen  the 
symbols  as  manipulable  entities  instead  of  just  as  an  unalterable  part  of  the 
whole. 

Until  Chase.  He  severed  the  coordinates  from  one  another  and  subjected 
the  resulting  fractions  to  various  cryptographic  treatments.  He  began  with  a 
checkerboard  filled  out  to  ten  columns  with  Greek  letters:

Chase  wrote  his  coordinates  vertically,  so  that  his  sample  plaintext,  Philip, 
appeared  like  this: 

13  3 13  1 

9 5 9 8 9 9 

He  then  multiplied  the  lower  line  by  9,  obtaining  the  result: 

13  3 13  1 

8 6 3 9 0 9 1 

This  he  restored  to  literal  form  by  resubstituting  back  in  his  checkerboard,  8 
(by  itself)  = l,  j,  or  t,  then  16  = N,  33  = s,  39  = I,  and  so  on,  with  the  final 
ciphertext  lnsi<Dix. 

Chase  proposed  other  means  of  transforming  the  bottom  row,  such  as 
adding  a repeating  key  or  giving  the  logarithm  of  the  row,  and  pointed 
out  that  even  more  intricate  processes  might  be  used.  “But  the  simpler  cypher, 
provided  it  is  effectual,  is  the  better,”  he  wisely  concludes.  The  Chase  systems 
grant  a fairly  hermetic  security;  they  are,  besides,  relatively  simple  to  operate. 
Yet  cryptologic  history  shows  no  one  ever  having  used  them,  even  though 
they  are  far  superior  to  many  systems  that  have  seen  service. 

Most  remarkable  of  the  Victorian  congregation  of  cryptologists  was  the 
Lucasian  Professor  of  Mathematics  at  Cambridge,  the  pioneer  who  enunciated 
the  principles  on  which  today’s  huge  electronic  computers  are  based  and  who 
himself  built  their  prototypes : Charles  Babbage.  Most  of  his  cryptologic  work 
was  never  published  and  hence  never  played  a role  in  the  science,  but  it  was 
astonishingly  advanced.  He  was  among  the  first  to  use  mathematical  notations 
and  formulas  in  cryptanalysis;  he  solved  polyalphabetics  at  a time  when  the 
system  was  still  regarded  as  “le  chiffre  indechiflfrable;”  he  appears  to  have 
been  the  first  to  solve  an  autokey.  The  few  words  that  he  wrote  on  the  subject 
are  pregnant  with  observations  that  bespeak  an  extraordinary  grasp  of  it. 

Born  in  1 792,  he  inherited  a considerable  fortune  from  his  father,  a banker. 
This  financed  his  many  interests — studies  of  railways,  archaeology,  submarine 
navigation,  occulting  lighthouses,  tree  rings  as  an  indicator  of  ancient  climate, 
lock  picking  (for  scientific  purposes  only),  what  is  now  known  as  operational 
research,  and  his  long,  bitter,  and  totally  unavailing  campaign  against  his 
pet  hate — organ-grinders  in  the  streets  of  London.  Babbage  was  fascinated 
by  statistical  phenomena,  compiling  tables  of  mortality  and  logarithms, 
counting  the  proportion  of  letters  in  various  texts,  and  measuring  the  pulse 
and  breathing  rate  of  any  animals  he  encountered.  Cryptology  may  have  been 
an  offshoot  of  his  statistical  interest,  which  also  led  to  his  lifelong  attempt  to

The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes 

apply  machinery  to  the  calculation  of  mathematical  tables.  A paper  on  this 
at  30  brought  him  the  first  gold  medal  of  the  Astronomical  Society,  and 
Babbage  spent  the  rest  of  his  life  trying  to  realize  his  vision  in  his  Difference 
and  Analytical  Engines.  He  even  resigned  his  Cambridge  professorship  after 
seven  years  to  devote  himself  more  completely  to  them. 

His  problem  was  that  he  never  finished  anything.  With  his  two  mathe- 
matical machines,  he  was  forever  getting  new  ideas  and  scrapping  all  that  he 
had  done.  The  government’s  exasperated  withdrawal  of  financial  support 
(which  he  had  largely  matched  out  of  his  own  pocket)  because  nothing  con- 
crete had  been  accomplished  turned  Babbage  later  in  life  from  a social  fellow 
of  interesting  conversation  and  a good  sense  of  humor  into  a bitter  man. 
Though  he  took  his  disappointment  to  the  grave  at  78,  his  ideas  ultimately 
triumphed  and,  in  particular,  the  logical  structure  of  his  Analytical  Engine 
remains  fully  visible  in  the  big  electronic  computers  of  today. 

The  opening  words  of  the  short  essay  he  published  on  cryptology  will 
ring  a familiar  bell  in  the  minds  of  amateurs  who  have  worked  until  3 a.m.  on 
a teaser:  “Deciphering  is,  in  my  opinion,  one  of  the  most  fascinating  of  arts, 
and  I fear  I have  wasted  upon  it  more  time  than  it  deserves.”  Like  his  acquain- 
tances Wheatstone  and  Playfair,  Babbage  delighted  in  solving  the  enciphered 
personal  advertisements  that  abounded  in  the  newspaper  “agony  columns;” 
this  may  account  for  his  further  observation  that  “very  few  ciphers  are  worth 
the  trouble  of  unravelling  them.” 

Babbage  is  also  the  only  person  known  to  have  sulfered  corporally  for  his 
cryptanalyses.  It  happened  at  school : “The  bigger  boys  made  ciphers,  but  if 
I got  hold  of  a few  words,  I usually  found  out  the  key.  The  consequence  of 
this  ingenuity  was  occasionally  painful:  the  owners  of  the  detected  ciphers 
sometimes  thrashed  me,  though  the  fault  lay  in  their  own  stupidity.” 

His  reputation  for  cryptanalytic  ability  did  not  wane  in  later  life,  though 
its  rewards  became  less  punishing.  In  July  of  1850,  he  solved  a cipher  of 
Henrietta  Maria,  queen  of  Charles  I,  though  he  turned  down  the  task  of 
solving  the  seven-page  cryptogram  of  the  king,  instead  recommending  Wheat- 
stone, who  succeeded.  He  solved  a note  in  a kind  of  shorthand  that  threw 
some  light  on  a historical  point  for  the  author  of  a life  of  John  Flamsteed, 
England’s  first  Astronomer  Royal.  On  April  20,  1 854,  barrister  S.  W.  Kinglake 
wrote  Babbage  from  Lincoln’s  Inn  asking  for  help  in  solving  some  cryptic 
correspondence  of  importance  in  a case.  Babbage  undertook  the  task  himself, 
solved  a sheaf  of  monalphabetically  enciphered  letters,  and  read  such 
intimacies  as  Where  is  it  to  end  and  You  have  had  warnin[g\  long  ago  of  what  I 
wished. 

During  these  years  he  was  also  solving  polyalphabetics.  The  messages 
retained  their  word  divisions,  and  Babbage  seized  on  these  to  make  his 
entries.  For  example,  in  1846,  he  broke  an  enciphered  letter  from  his  nephew, 
Henry,  by  guessing  that  it  began  Dear  Uncle  and  ended  with  nephew 
and  Henry.  The  cryptogram  was  in  Vigenere,  the  key  SOMERSET.  He

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


demonstrated  a lively  appreciation  of  periodicity — the  repetition  of  the  key 
— and,  replying  to  a public  challenge,  even  managed  to  extricate  the  two 
primary  keys  TWO  and  COMBINED  from  a complicated  invented  cipher 
that  amounted  to  a double  encipherment  in  Vigenere,  first  by  one  key,  then 
by  the  other. 

“One  of  the  most  singular  characteristics  of  the  art  of  deciphering,”  he 
declared  in  his  autobiography.  Passages  from  the  Life  of  a Philosopher,  “is  the 
strong  conviction  possessed  by  every  person,  even  moderately  acquainted 
with  it,  that  he  is  able  to  construct  a cipher  which  nobody  else  can  decipher. 
I have  also  observed  that  the  cleverer  the  person,  the  more  intimate  is  his 
conviction.  In  my  earliest  study  of  the  subject,  I shared  in  this  belief,  and 
maintained  it  for  many  years.

Charles  Babbage  uses  mathematics  to  solve  a cipher 

“In  a conversation  on  that  subject  which  I had  with  the  late  Mr.  Davies 
Gilbert,  President  of  the  Royal  Society,”  he  continued,  “each  maintained  that 
he  possessed  a cipher  which  was  absolutely  inscrutable.  On  comparison,  it 
appeared  that  we  had  both  imagined  the  same  law.”  This  proved  to  be  the  use 
of  each  cipher  letter  as  the  key  for  the  following  plaintext  letter.  Both  Bab- 
bage and  Gilbert  had  independently  reinvented,  with  a mixed  alphabet,  the 
autokey  of  Cardano  and  Vigenere — though  Babbage  readily  admitted  that 
“1  am  not  sure  that  it  may  not  be  found  in  the  Steganographia  of  Schott,  or 
even  of  Trithemius.”  Years  later,  while  explaining  the  cipher  to  a friend,  “an 
indistinct  glimpse  of  defeating  it  presented  itself  vaguely  to  my  imagination.” 
He  went  on  to  solve  it,  aided,  no  doubt,  by  word  divisions,  but  achieving 
nevertheless  the  first  autokey  solution  in  history.  The  mixed  cipher  alphabet 
raises  this  to  the  level  of  a substantial  accomplishment  indeed. 


207 


The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes 

Babbage  most  strikingly  demonstrated  his  originality  of  thought  when  he 
applied  algebra  to  cryptology.  His  papers  are  filled  with  formulas  which  he 
used  to  help  him  solve  ciphers  and  see  their  underlying  structure  more  clearly. 
Unfortunately  his  notes  are  too  scrappy  and  incomplete  to  give  any  more  than 
a tantalizing  glimpse  of  what  he  was  trying  to  accomplish.  His  most  imposing 
formula,  which  he  jotted  down  on  worksheets  dealing  with  a numerical 
cryptogram  sent  him  by  Gilbert,  is  this : 

a _ A[R[  — A! R2  — A2R!  + A2T2  — A0R2  + AqR3  — AjR2  — A, R3 

Aj  2A^2 1- A2  — Aq^2  T AqAj  T — AjA-3 

It  may  have  been  as  efficacious  as  it  is  formidable,  but  neither  an  index  to  its 
symbolism  nor  any  clue  to  its  purpose  exists. 

Babbage’s  talents  in  cryptology  appear  to  have  been  as  exceptional  as 
they  were  in  other  fields,  and  they  were  crippled  by  the  same  defect:  the 
inability  to  leave  off  improving  and  to  finish  a work  despite  its  imperfections. 
Had  he  published  any  specifics  of  his  cryptanalyses,  their  insights  might  have 
upended  the  science.  But  his  flaw  robbed  him  of  this  distinction. 

Of  the  man  who  did  explode  the  bomb  that  gouged  new  channels  for 
cryptology,  little  more  is  known  than  the  bare  outline  provided  by  his  service 
record.  This  is  complete  if  not  detailed,  for  Friedrich  W.  Kasiski  spent  his 
entire  professional  career  as  an  officer  in  East  Prussia’s  33rd  Infantry  Regiment. 
Born  November  29,  1805,  in  what  was  then  Schlochau,  West  Prussia,  and  is 
now  Czluchow,  Poland,  he  enlisted  in  the  regiment  at  17.  He  won  his  com- 
mission as  a second  lieutenant  three  years  later,  in  1825 — and  did  not  budge 
out  of  that  rank  for  14  years.  But  he  remained  a first  lieutenant  only  three 
years  before  he  was  promoted  to  captain  and  company  commander,  a post 
he  held  for  nine  years.  He  retired  in  1852  with  the  rank  of  major,  and  though 
he  served  from  1860  to  1868  as  the  commander  of  a National  Guard-like 
battalion,  he  found  sufficient  leisure  to  devote  some  to  cryptology,  for  in 
1863  his  short  but  epochal  book  was  published  in  Berlin  by  the  respected 
house  of  Mittler  & Sohn. 

Three  quarters  of  Die  Geheimschriften  unci  die  Dechiffrir-kunst  concen- 
trates on  answering  the  problem  that  had  vexed  cryptanalysts  for  more  than 
300  years:  how  to  achieve  a general  solution  for  polyalphabetic  ciphers  with 
repeating  keywords.  (One  chapter  zeros  in  on  “The  Decipherment  of  French 
Writing” — a rather  ominous  portent  in  a book  dedicated  to  the  Count 
Albrecht  von  Roon,  the  Prussian  minister  of  war  who  molded  the  army  that 
humbled  France  only  seven  years  later.)  The  polyalphabetic  solution  opened 
the  doors  to  the  cryptology  of  today.  But  the  95-page  volume  seems  to  have 
stirred  almost  no  comment  at  the  time.  Kasiski  himself  lost  interest  in 
cryptology.  He  became  an  avid  amateur  anthropologist,  joining  the  Natural 
Science  Society  of  Danzig,  unearthing  prehistoric  graves,  and  reporting  on 
his  work  to  learned  journals.  (One  of  his  scholarly  articles  was  cited  in  the 


208 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Encyclopaedia  Britannica .)  Kasiski  died  on  May  22,  1881,  almost  certainly 
without  realizing  that  he  had  wrought  a revolution  in  cryptology. 

That  revolution  had  begun  when  Kasiski  seized  upon  a phenomenon  that 
Porta  and  perhaps  others  had  observed  but  not  recognized.  This  is  that  the 
conjunction  of  a repeated  portion  of  the  key  with  a repetition  in  the  plaintext 
produces  a repetition  in  the  ciphertext : 

key  RUNRUNRUNRUNRUNRUNR  UNRUN  RUNRUN 

plaintext  tobeornottobethatisthequestion 
ciphertext  k iov  iee  igki  ovnurnvj  nuvkhvmgz  i a 

Each  time  that  the  key  RUNR  engages  the  repeated  plaintext  to  be,  the 
repeated  ciphertext  tetragraph  kiov  results.  Like  causes  produce  like  effects. 
Similarly,  when  the  repeated  key-fragment  UN  operates  upon  the  repeated 
t/i’s,  the  ciphertext  registers  repeated  nu’s. 

Clearly,  the  keyword  must  repeat  one  or  more  times  for  a given  part  of  it  to 
encipher  two  identical  bits  of  plaintext  several  letters  distant  from  one  another. 
The  number  of  letters  between  the  two  resultant  ciphertext  repetitions  will 
record  the  number  of  times  that  the  keyword  has  repeated.  The  count  of  the 
interval  “between”  the  two  repetitions  actually  includes  repeated  letters.  Thus 
the  interval  between  the  first  kiov  and  the  second  is  9,  figured  like  this:  5 
letters  not  repeated  and  4 that  are.  This  interval  of  nine  results  from  the  fact 
that  the  keyword  has  three  letters  and  has  repeated  three  times.  These 
repetitions  betray  the  movements  of  the  keyword  beneath  the  surface  of  the 
cryptogram  just  as  the  ducking  of  a fishing  cork  tells  of  a nibble.  Analysis  of 
the  intervals  between  the  repetitions  can  disclose  the  length  of  the  keyword. 

Obviously,  not  all  plaintext  repeats  will  show  up  as  ciphertext  repetitions. 
The  two  tV s of  that  is  and  question  do  not  because  they  are  enciphered  by 
different  key  digraphs,  nor  do  the  st’s  of  is  the  and  question.  Furthermore, 
repetitions  sometimes  appear  that  are  no  more  than  the  result  of  coincidence. 
For  example,  th  keyed  by  CO  will  become  vv  in  Vigenere,  but  so  will  ir  keyed 
by  NE.  Two  appearances  of  vv  thus  do  not  indubitably  reflect  a repetition  of 
plaintext  th.  These  spurious  indications  are  usually  called  “accidental”  repeti- 
tions in  polyalphabetic  cryptanalysis  to  distinguish  them  from  the  “true” 
repetitions,  like  kiov. 

Accidental  repetitions  will  naturally  give  some  false  clues  about  the  length 
of  the  keyword.  But  since  their  effect  is  diffused,  whereas  that  of  the  true 
repetitions  is  concentrated,  the  real  keyword  length  usually  shows  up  fairly 
clearly.  Knowledge  of  how  many  letters  are  in  the  keyword  tells  how  many 
alphabets  were  used  in  the  polyalphabetic  encipherment.  This  information 
permits  the  cryptanalyst  to  sort  the  letters  of  the  cryptogram  so  that  all  those 
enciphered  with  the  first  keyletter  are  brought  together  in  one  group,  all  those 
enciphered  with  the  second  keyletter  in  another  group,  and  so  forth.  Since  all 
of  the,  say,  e's  in  the  first  group  were  converted  under  the  influence  of  a single 
keyletter  to  the  same  ciphertext  letter,  all  of  the  a' s to  one  ciphertext  letter, 


The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes  209 

and  so  on,  each  of  these  collections  of  letters  constitutes  a mon  alphabetic 
substitution  cipher  and  so  can  be  solved  like  one. 

An  example  using  the  following  cryptogram  should  make  this  clear:

Repetitions  of  three  letters  or  more  have  been  underlined ; bigraphic  ones 
have  been  ignored  here  as  too  frequent,  though  in  shorter  cryptograms  they 
are  quite  valuable.  The  monoliteral  frequency  count  is: 

E SMYTAKULNPGJ  RZVWBHCXFDI  QO 
22  18  16  16  15  14  14  14  13  13  13  12  11  11  11  10  9 8 8 7 7 6 5 5 5 4 

It  differs  strikingly  from  the  count  of  a monalphabetic  substitution.  All  26 
letters  appear  several  times,  while  several  would  be  missing  from  an  equally 
long  monalphabetic  cryptogram.  No  one  letter  stands  out  remarkably;  the 
two  most  frequent  reach  only  7.7  and  6.3  per  cent,  compared  to  the  12  per 
cent  in  a monalphabetic  substitution.  The  profile  shows  no  plateaus  of  high-, 
medium-,  low-,  and  rare-frequency  letters.  Instead  it  descends  in  a gentle, 
even  slope.  These  characteristics  result  from  the  dispersal  of  individual  letter- 
frequencies  among  the  several  alphabets. 

With  the  repetitions  located,  Kasiski  advised  the  cryptanalyst  to  “cal- 
culate the  distance  separating  the  repetitions  from  one  another.  . . . and 
endeavor  to  break  up  this  number  into  its  factors.  . . . The  factor  most  fre- 
quently found  indicates  the  number  of  letters  in  the  key.”  Cryptanalysts 
usually  perform  this  operation — now  called  a “Kasiski  examination” — in 
tabular  form.

The  most  frequent  factor  is  2,  which  appears  in  every  instance.  But  since

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


letters  are  extremely  unlikely,  cryptanalysts  usually  consider  only  lengths  of 

4 and  above.  In  the  above  list,  4,  or  2 x 2,  occurs  in  five  of  the  eight  intervals, 

5 in  only  one,  6 in  six,  7 in  two,  8 in  two,  9 in  two,  12  in  four,  and  all  others 
except  multiples  of  these  (as  18  and  24)  occur  but  once.  At  first,  6 seems  to  be 
the  proper  choice  on  the  basis  of  frequency.  On  second  thought,  however, 
12  makes  an  even  better  showing,  considering  that  a repetition  has  only  half 
as  many  chances  to  show  up  in  a period  of  12  as  in  one  of  6.  But  then  the 
cryptanalyst,  checking,  sees  that  the  period  of  12  would  make  the  2 x 3 x 19 
interval  of  leebmmtg  an  accidental  one,  which  is  exceedingly  unlikely, 
and  that  a period  of  6 would  keep  it  as  a key-caused  repetition.  He  therefore 
returns  to  the  period  of  6.  The  behavior  of  the  yvgys  repetition  can  only 
be  ignored  for  the  moment. 

The  cryptanalyst  then  writes  out  the  cryptogram  in  lines  six  letters  wide, 
thus  setting  beneath  one  another  all  the  letters  presumed  enciphered  with 
the  same  keyletter.  He  segregates  each  column  and  attempts  to  find  the 
plaintext  equivalents  of  the  letters  in  each  one.  With  the  above  cryptogram, 
he  finds  the  following  48  letters  in  the  first  column.  These  represent  all  the 
letters  homogeneously  enciphered  by  the  first  keyletter  (if  the  period  of  6 is 
correct)  and  constitute  the  1st,  7th,  13th,  19th,  25th,  31st,  and  so  on,  letters 
in  the  cryptogram:  aslkvhuwzljukhmsgmszkuwwslhzwutjazsj 
MVEWUYJGJJSY. 

Meager  though  its  frequency  count  is,  it  indubitably  reflects  a monalpha- 
betic  substitution;  a polyalphabetic  count  would  be  much  smoother: 


This  is  an  encouraging  sign  to  the  cryptanalyst,  for  only  if  his  deduction  about 
the  period  is  correct  will  such  a count  be  monalphabetic. 

To  the  experienced  eye,  the  little  hills  and  dales  of  that  frequency  count 
limn  one  thing:  the  normal  profile.  This  is  the  outline  made  by  the  standard 
frequency  count  (of  English).  It  does  not  have  to  start  at  a;  it  preserves  its 
shape  even  in  cyclical  form,  and,  when  dealing  with  the  Caesar  alphabets  of 
the  Vigenere  family,  this  is  the  form  in  which  the  cryptanalyst  will  most  often 
meet  it.  The  single  most  durable  and  detectable  feature  of  the  normal  profile 
is  the  long,  low  peneplane  of  uvwxyz,  which  extends  almost  a quarter  of  the 
profile  and  is  extremely  depressed.  This  basin  is  sharply  walled  off  by  the  rst 
cordillera  at  one  end  and  the  single  peak  of  a at  the  other.  The  other  features 
of  the  profile  are  more  easily  eroded  by  decreases  in  size  of  sample.  The 
pinnacle  of  e normally  soars  midway  between  a and  the  double  tower  of  hi, 
which  is  followed  by  the  severe  drop  to  jk.  High-frequency  n and  o also  rise 
to  twin  peaks.  In  short  samples,  however,  the  troughs  of  the  profile  are  often 
more  reliable  indicators  than  the  crests. 

This  physiognomy  appears,  in  stunted  form,  in  the  count  above.  The  low- 
frequency  depression  is  unmistakable  at  nopqr.  The  rst  group  cannot  be

The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes 

matched  with  klm,  for  then  high-frequency  j would  represent  q and  the  high- 
frequency  s would  represent  z.  It  must  thus  coincide  with  jkl,  and  though 
this  gives  plaintext  u a slightly  disproportionate  frequency,  it  is  one  well 
within  the  allowable  limits.  Plaintext  c also  has  too  high  a frequency,  but  this 
is  one  of  the  normal  abnormalities  that  the  cryptanalyst  must  expect.  In 
general,  then,  the  match  is  satisfactory.  If  both  the  plain  and  cipher  alphabets 
are  known,  as  they  are  here,  being  both  normal  alphabets,  the  identification 
of  a single  plaintext  letter  will  align  the  cipher  alphabet  with  the  plain  alpha- 
bet and  thus  instantaneously  yield  the  identification  of  every  other  cipher 
letter.  In  this  case,  the  cryptanalyst  fixes  the  alignment  of  the  plain  and  the 
cipher  components  at  the  “point”  uvwxyz  = mnopqr,  with  this  result: 

plain  ijklmnopqrst  uvwxyzabcdefgh 
cipher,  ABCDEFGHI  J KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 

This  can  be  cycled  to  bring  the  plaintext  a to  the  head,  which  is  the  more  usual 
arrangement,  but  the  plain-to-cipher  equivalencies  will  remain  the  same. 
These  equivalents  are,  for  the  48  letters  enciphered  by  the  first  keyletter: 

cipher  aslkvhuwzljukhmsgmszkuwwslhzwutjazsjmvewuyjgjjsy 
plain  iatsdpce  htrcspuaouahsce  e atphe  cbri  harudmecgrorrag 

This  is  quite  an  acceptable  aggregation  of  plaintext  letters,  and  the  solution 
picks  up  momentum. 

Perhaps  the  most  important  thing  that  the  cryptanalyst  learned  from  the 
identification  of  the  alphabet  as  the  normal  profile  was  that  the  cipher  be- 
longed to  the  Vigenere  family.  This  opens  the  door  to  a whole  variety  of 
special  techniques.  These  are  based  on  the  fact  that  the  alphabet,  in  this 
family  of  ciphers,  is  known.  The  techniques  would  work  as  well  for  any  other 
polyalphabetic  cipher  in  which  the  cipher  alphabet  is  known  to  the  crypt- 
analyst, but  such  situations  arise  far  more  frequently  with  the  Vigenere 
family  because  the  standard  A-to-Z  arrangement  that  it  employs  is  universally 
known  and  extensively  applied. 

One  of  these  special  techniques  identifies  plaintext  letters  mechanically.  It 
employs  cardboard  strips  with  the  alphabet  printed  on  them  twice,  the  nine 
high-frequency  letters  (e,  t,  a,  o,  n , /,  r,  s,  h)  in  red,  the  others  in  black.  The 
cryptanalyst  aligns  the  strips  under  one  another  to  bring  the  ciphertext  letters 
into  a column.  The  other  columns  that  are  automatically  formed  out  to  the 
right  represent  all  the  possible  solutions  for  that  aggregation  of  ciphertext 
letters.  The  cryptanalyst  scans  them  to  see  which  one  is  the  reddest  by  virtue 
of  having  the  most  high-frequency  letters.  Probability  theory  can  predict  how 
likely  it  is  that  the  reddest  column  will  be  the  correct  one:  with  nine  cipher- 
text  letters,  42  per  cent;  with  twelve,  61  per  cent;  with  fifteen,  74  per  cent. 
If  the  next-to-reddest  column  is  included,  the  probabilities  that  either  it  or 
the  reddest  will  prove  the  correct  plaintext  rise  to  74,  85,  and  90  per  cent, 
respectively. 


212 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


A practical  drawback  is  that  since  nine  letters  comprise  fully  a third  of  the 
alphabet,  most  columns  will  look  fairly  red.  It  is  easier  to  cast  out  the  wrong 
columns  than  to  choose  the  right  one,  and  the  best  criterion  for  rejection  is 
the  presence  of  too  many  rare  letters.  The  color  principle  may  be  applied  to 
them:  blue  for  the  five  low-frequency  letters.  This  technique  is  illustrated  in 
printed  form  in  the  accompanying  table  by  using  boldface  for  j,  k,  q,  x,  and  z. 
The  ciphertext  letters  shown  are  the  first  ten  that  have  been  enciphered  by  the 
second  keyletter  (the  2nd,  8th,  14th,  20th,  26th,  and  so  on,  letters  of  the 
cryptogram).  Now  the  five  low-frequency  letters  combined  have  a frequency 
of  about  2 per  cent.  In  a text  of  48  letters  like  this,  then,  the  five  should  have 
a total  frequency  of  one  letter.  The  cryptanalyst  will  be  playing  it  safe  if  he 
passes  over  any  full  column  with  three  or  more  boldface  letters.

On  this  basis,  only  the  column  beginning  flop  is  acceptable.  When  these 
letters  are  paired  with  those  that  would  precede  them  in  the  plaintext,  the 
correctness  of  both  choices  becomes  incontrovertible:

The  Contribution  of  the  Dilettantes 

From  this  point  on,  the  cryptanalyst  can  complete  the  solution  by  guessing  at 
words  and  seeing  what  effects  they  produce.  For  example,  the  he  screams  for 
a t to  precede  it;  this  would  be  the  e in  column  6.  A test  decipherment  with  the 
alphabet  in  which  t = e,  which,  in  Vigenere,  is  the  alphabet  of  keyletter  L, 
proves  eminently  satisfactory:  e,  e,  n,  t,  a,  r,  m,  ...  . 

In  the  end,  the  key  turns  out  to  be  SIGNAL  and  the  plaintext  to  be  as 
follows : If  signals  are  to  be  displayed  in  the  presence  of  an  enemy , they  must  be 
guarded  by  ciphers.  The  ciphers  must  be  capable  of  frequent  changes.  The  rules 
by  which  these  changes  are  made  must  be  simple.  Ciphers  are  undiscoverable  in 
proportion  as  their  changes  are  frequent  and  as  the  messages  in  each  change  are 
brief.  From  Albert  J.  Myer's  Manual  of  Signals. 

The  longest  repetition,  leebmmtg,  resulted  from  the  coincidence  of  the 
repeated  frequent  with  the  key  GNALSIGN,  and  the  next  longest,  zudljk, 
from  the  coincidence  of  the  two  must  he's  with  the  key  NALSIG.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  threefold  repetition  of  ciphers  and  the  fourfold  repetition  of 
change  did  not  pole  through  the  fabric  of  the  ciphertext  because  each  en- 
countered different  sections  of  the  key.  The  accidental  repetition  y vgys  resulted 
from  a freak  situation  in  which  the  key  GNALS  enciphered  signa  and  then 
the  key  SIGNA  enciphered  gnats.  Accidental  repetitions  longer  than  trigraphs 
are  extremely  rare,  though  they  have  been  known  to  occur. 

What  if  the  alphabets  used  in  the  repeating-key  system  are  unknown? 
The  cryptanalyst  is  faced  with  the  problem  of  quarrying  out  plaintext  letter 
after  letter,  since  a single  identification  will  not  carry  all  with  it.  Usually  he 
conducts  a linguistic  analysis,  and  on  the  basis  of  contacts,  frequency,  and  so 
forth,  makes  a few  tentative  assumptions.  These  follow  the  lines  laid  down  for 
monalphabetic  substitutions.  He  substitutes  these  assumptions  back  into 
the  cryptogram  and  reconstructs  the  plaintext  bit  by  bit,  often  aided  by  a 
recovery  of  the  key  and  reconstruction  of  the  cipher  alphabets.  The  process 
usually  requires  40  to  60  letters  per  keyletter  for  success.

CRISES  OF  THE  UNION 


shortly  after  the  fateful  guns  spoke  at  Fort  Sumter,  a 36-year-old  tele- 
grapher was  summoned  to  the  Cincinnati  house  of  the  commander  of  the 
military  Department  of  the  Ohio.  Anson  Stager  had  risen  rapidly  to  become 
the  first  general  superintendent  of  the  newly  formed  Western  Union  Telegraph 
Company;  on  mobilization,  he  had  been  given  charge  of  the  Department  of 
the  Ohio’s  military  telegraphs.  He  had  previously  devised  a cipher  for  Ohio’s 
Governor  Dennison  that  had  worked  just  fine  in  communication  with  his 
gubernatorial  colleagues  in  Indiana  and  Illinois,  and  Major  General  George 
B.  McClellan  wanted  Stager  to  draw  up  a military  cipher  along  these  lines. 

Stager  complied.  Soon  McClellan  was  relying  on  the  cipher  to  protect  his 
communications  during  his  successful  campaign  in  West  Virginia,  and  Major 
General  John  C.  Fremont,  commander  of  the  Western  Department,  trans- 
mitted orders  for  his  operations  in  it.  One  of  its  very  first  users  was  the 
detective  Allan  Pinkerton,  founder  of  the  agency  that  bears  his  name.  The 
key  of  the  cipher  was  so  short  that  one  colonel  carried  it  on  the  back  of  a 
business  card.  Its  brevity  and  dependability  endeared  it  to  McClellan,  who 
brought  it  with  him  later  in  1861  when  he  came  east  to  assume  command  of 
the  Army  of  the  Potomac.  From  there  it  spread  rapidly  throughout  the 
Union  forces,  becoming  the  best  as  well  as  the  best-known  cipher  of  the 
Civil  War.  It  was  the  first  military  cipher  to  be  used  extensively,  largely  because 
the  Civil  War  first  employed  the  telegraph  on  a large  scale. 

The  cipher  was  a word  transposition.  Stager’s  telegraphic  experience 
evidently  led  him  to  a system  in  which  the  ciphertext  consisted — as  in  the  new 
telegraph  codes — of  ordinary  words,  which  are  far  less  subject  to  dangerous 
garbles  than  groups  of  incoherent  letters.  The  system  also  had  an  appealing 
simplicity:  the  plaintext  was  written  out  in  lines  and  transcribed  by  columns, 
up  some  and  down  others  in  a specified  order.  As  the  war  progressed,  some 
simple  improvements  noticeably  strengthened  it.  Nulls  ruffled  the  transcrip- 
tion. Routes  traced  mazes  of  diagonals  and  interrupted  columns  through 
ever  larger  rectangles.  Samuel  H.  Beckwith,  Ulysses  S.  Grant’s  cipher  opera- 
tor, suggested  that  important  terms  be  represented  by  codewords  which  he 
carefully  chose  to  minimize  telegraphic  error.  The  cipher  expanded  from  one 
that  could  be  contained  on  a single  card  to  one  that,  at  the  end  of  the  war, 

214 


215 


Crises  of  the  Union 

required  12  pages  to  list  routes  and  36  for  the  1,608  codewords.  This  was 
Cipher  No.  4,  the  last  of  a series  of  12  that  the  North  employed  at  various 
times.* 

A good  example  of  the  system  is  given  by  the  encipherment  of  this  mes- 
sage sent  by  Abraham  Lincoln  on  June  1,  1863:  “For  Colonel  Ludlow. 
Richardson  and  Brown,  correspondents  of  the  Tribune,  captured  at  Vicksburg, 
are  detained  at  Richmond.  Please  ascertain  why  they  are  detained  and  get  them 
off  if  you  can.  The  President.”  Cipher  No.  9 was  in  use,  and  it  provided  the 
following  codeword  substitutions : venus  for  colonel,  wayland  for  captured, 
odor  for  Vicksburg,  neptune  for  Richmond,  adam  for  President  of  U.S.,  and 
nelly  for  4 : 30 p.m.,  the  time  of  dispatch.  The  encipherer  chose  to  write  out 
the  message  in  seven  lines  of  five  words  each  with  three  nulls  to  complete  the 
rectangle :

The  route  for  this  configuration  ran  up  the  first  column,  down  the  second,  up 
the  fifth,  down  the  fourth,  up  the  third.  Nulls  were  inserted  at  the  end  of  each 
column.  With  the  keyword  GUARD  heading  the  message  to  indicate  the 
size  of  the  rectangle  and  its  route,  this  ciphertext  resulted:  guard  adam  them

This  particular  telegram  was  sent  from  the  War  Department  over  the 
signature  of  Major  Thomas  T.  Eckert,  the  general  superintendent  of  military 
telegraphs,  who  later  became  chairman  of  the  board  of  the  Western  Union 
Telegraph  Company.  Because  the  flow  of  orders  and  reports  through  Eckert’s 
office  gave  a more  detailed  and  up-to-the-minute  picture  of  the  war  than  any 
other  source,  Lincoln  paid  it  frequent  visits.  He  virtually  lived  there  during 
battles.  The  telegraph  office  and  its  adjunct,  the  cipher  quarters,  were  located 

* These  do  not  include  the  ciphers — mostly  simple  word  transpositions — that  the  several 
military  departments  employed  within  their  own  territory.  The  Department  of  the  Missouri 
used  these  more  extensively  than  any  other.  A number  of  other  cipher  systems  were  proposed 
by  members  of  the  infant  Signal  Corps.  They  generally  consisted  of  various  types  of  poly- 
alphabetic  systems,  and  one  of  them — a fanlike  set  of  26  wooden  tablets,  each  with  a differ- 
ent ciphertext  alphabet  on  it,  designed  for  use  with  a keyword  by  Sergeant  Edwin  H. 
Hawley — matured  into  the  first  United  States  patent  granted  for  a cipher  device  (No. 
48,681,  July  11,  1865). 


216 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


in  a converted  library  and  its  anteroom,  respectively,  on  the  second  floor  of 
the  War  Department  building,  which  stood  next  to  the  White  House.  Here 
Lincoln  relaxed  and  chatted  daily  with  the  three  young  telegrapher-cipher- 
operators,  David  Homer  Bates,  Charles  A.  Tinker,  and  Albert  B.  Chandler. 
Bates,  who  was  only  18  when  the  war  started,  told  about  it  years  later: 

“Outside  the  members  of  his  cabinet  and  his  private  secretaries,  none  were 
brought  into  closer  or  more  confidential  relations  with  Lincoln  than  the 
cipher-operators,  . . . for  during  the  Civil  War  the  President  spent  more  of  his 
waking  hours  in  the  War  Department  telegraph  office  than  in  any  other  place, 

except  the  White  House His  tall,  homely  form  could  be  seen  crossing  the 

well-shaded  lawn  between  the  White  House  and  the  War  Department  day 
after  day  with  unvaried  regularity.”  When  Lincoln  entered  the  cipher  room 
he  would  open  a little  drawer  in  one  of  the  desks  and  read  the  carbon  copies 
of  messages  that  the  operators  had  made  on  lettersize  tissue  paper  and  placed, 
unfolded,  in  that  drawer  for  the  President’s  information. 

“It  was  his  habit  to  read  from  the  top  down,”  Chandler  wrote,  “and  when 
he  came  to  those  which  he  had  already  read,  with  a smile  he  said,  Well,  I 
guess  I have  got  down  to  the  raisins.’  As  I seemed  in  doubt  as  to  what  that 
might  mean,  he  explained  that  a little  girl,  having  eaten  improperly  both  in 
quantity  and  quality,  beginning  with  a lot  of  raisins,  was  made  quite  ill,  and 
could  find  relief  only  in  the  process  which  a sick  stomach  is  likely  to  compel. 
After  an  exhausting  siege  she  gave  an  exclamation  of  satisfaction  that  the  end 
of  her  trouble  was  near,  for  she  had  ‘got  down  to  the  raisins.’  ” 

Once  when  Lincoln  entered  the  telegraph  office  on  a day  of  national 
fasting,  he  noticed  that  all  the  operators  were  busy,  and  he  remarked: 
“Gentlemen,  this  is  fast  day,  and  I am  pleased  to  observe  that  you  are  working 
as  fast  as  you  can ; the  proclamation  was  mine,  and  that  is  my  interpretation 
of  its  bearing  on  you.”  When  a battle  was  in  progress,  the  President  would 
look  over  the  shoulders  of  the  young  cipher  operators  as  an  especially  import- 
ant message  was  being  deciphered.  Sometimes  he  would  read  the  dispatches 
aloud,  and  when  he  reached  such  codewords  as  hosanna  and  husband,  both 
of  which  meant  Jefferson  Davis  in  one  cipher,  or  hunter  and  happy,  both 
meaning  Robert  E.  Lee,  he  would  invariably  translate  them  as  “Jeffy  D”  or 
“Bobby  Lee.” 

War  is  hell,  Sherman  said,  but  he  didn’t  know  Confederate  cryptography. 
In  contrast  to  the  close-knit  Union  organization,  the  South  apparently  ex- 
tended the  states’  rights  principle  into  the  realm  of  cryptography  and  let  each 
commanding  officer  choose  his  own  codes  and  ciphers.  Thus,  just  before  the 
Battle  of  Shiloh,  on  April  6,  1862,  that  excellent  officer  but  indifferent 
cryptographer,  General  Albert  S.  Johnston,  agreed  with  his  second-in-com- 
mand, General  Pierre  Beauregard,  upon  a Caesar  substitution  for  military 
use!  Two  weeks  earlier  President  Jefferson  Davis  had  sent  Johnston  “a 
dictionary  of  which  I have  the  duplicate.  ...  the  word  junction  would  be 


217 


Crises  of  the  Union 

designated  by  146.  l.  20,”  meaning,  respectively,  page  number,  left-hand 
column,  and  word  number.  Beauregard,  in  turn,  sent  Major  General  Patton 
Anderson  a mon  alphabetic  cipher  to  assure  the  secrecy  of  their  communica- 
tions. The  Secretary  of  the  Navy,  Stephen  B.  Mallory,  instructed  Lieutenant 
John  N.  Maffitt,  then  in  Mobile  readying  the  cruiser  Florida  for  its  spectacu- 
larly destructive  cruise  against  Northern  shipping,  to  buy  two  identical  copies 
of  a dictionary  for  use  as  a codebook.  His  colleague,  the  dashing  Commander 
Raphael  Semmes,  likewise  bought  copies  of  Reid's  English  Dictionary  for  the 
same  purpose  as  part  of  his  preparation  for  his  harassment  of  merchantmen 
in  Sumter,  the  Confederacy’s  first  warship.

A Confederate  cipher  telegram,  in  Vigenere 

The  rebels  reposed  their  major  trust,  however,  in  the  Vigenere,  sometimes 
using  it  in  the  form  of  a brass  cipher  disk.  In  theory,  it  was  an  excellent  choice, 
for  so  far  as  the  South  knew  the  cipher  was  unbreakable.  In  practice,  it  proved 
a dismal  failure.  For  one  thing,  transmission  errors  that  added  or  subtracted 
a letter  (American  Morse  was  peculiarly  susceptible  to  this  kind)  unmeshed 
the  key  from  the  cipher  and  caused  no  end  of  difficulty.  Once  Major  Cunning- 
ham of  General  Kirby  Smith’s  staff  tried  for  twelve  hours  to  decipher  a 
garbled  message;  he  finally  gave  up  in  disgust  and  galloped  around  the 
Union  flank  to  the  sender  to  find  out  what  it  said.  For  another,  it  could  be 
solved  by  intuitive  techniques.  And  if  the  South  had  difficulty  reading  Dixie 
cipher  messages,  the  North  did  not.  “It  would  sometimes  take  too  long  to 
make  translations  of  intercepted  dispatches  for  us  to  receive  any  benefit 
from  them,”  Ulysses  S.  Grant  wrote.  “But  sometimes  they  gave  useful  in- 
formation.”

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

During  the  siege  of  Vicksburg,  Grant’s  troops  captured  eight  rebels  who 
were  trying  to  slip  into  the  beleaguered  city  with  200,000  percussion  caps.  On 
one  of  them  the  Federals  found  the  following  cryptogram,  which  Grant  sent 
to  Washington  “hoping  that  someone  there  may  be  able  to  make  it  out”:

Lincoln’s  three  young  cipher  operators — Tinker,  Chandler,  and  Bates — soon 
solved  it.  It  proved  to  be  a Vigenere,  key  MANCHESTER  BLUFF,  and  its 
clear  (after  corrections)  read  as  follows  (with  the  two  words  not  solved  by  the

This  was  only  one  of  a number  of  Confederate  cryptograms  solved  by  this 
triumvirate,  who,  being  barely  out  of  their  teens,  were  probably  the  youngest 
wartime  cryptanalysts  in  history.  The  solution  did  not  help  Grant  take 
Vicksburg,  but  it  provided  the  three  young  men  with  a Confederate  keyword, 
of  which  the  South  apparently  used  only  three  during  the  war.  Early  in  1865, 

J.  B.  Devoe,  acting  master  of  the  United  States  Navy,  was  reporting  to  the 
Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Navy  the  two  known  keywords — MANCHESTER 
BLUFF  and  COMPLETE  VICTORY  (a  phrase  the  Confederates  clung  to 
long  after  that  cherished  hope  had  dissipated) — and  confessing  that  “the  new 
key  is  not  known.”  But  the  youngsters’  most  important  solution  dealt  not 
with  military  but  with  political  affairs. 

In  December  of  1863,  Postmaster  Abram  Wakeman  of  New  York  spotted 
an  envelope  addressed  to  Alexander  Keith,  Jr.,  in  Halifax,  Nova  Scotia,  who 
was  known  to  be  in  frequent  communication  with  rebel  agents.  Wakeman 
turned  it  over  to  the  Secretary  of  War,  who  found  that  the  letter  inside  was 
written  in  a complicated  mixture  of  symbol  ciphers.  After  War  Department 
clerks  puzzled  over  the  mysterious  signs  in  vain  for  two  days,  the  crypto- 
gram was  given  to  the  “Sacred  Three,”  as  Bates,  Chandler,  and  Tinker  liked 
to  call  themselves.  They  determined  to  do  what  the  clerks  could  not. 

They  ascertained  that  the  unknown  encipherer  had  intermingled  five 
different  kinds  of  signs  plus  ordinary  letters  as  substitutes  in  the  letter.  But  he 


219 


Crises  of  the  Union 

had  imprudently  marked  off  the  words  with  commas  and  confined  himself 
to  a single  set  of  signs  within  each  word.  The  letter  patterns  of  the  plaintext 
consequently  showed  through.  One  6-letter  word  repeated  its  second  and  sixth 
letters.  It  was  followed  by  a 4-letter  word  that  in  turn  was  followed  by  the 
cleartext  phrase  reaches  you.  The  three  deduced  that  the  sequence  should  read 
before  this  reaches  you.  Bates  recognized  the  ciphertext  signs  involved  as  those 
of  the  pigpen  cipher,  which  had  been  used  as  a price  marker  in  the  Pittsburgh

of  the  entire  pigpen  alphabet,  driving  a substantial  wedge  into  the  cryptogram. 
The  identification  of  signs  in  the  dateline  as  standing  for  “N.  Y.  Dec.  1 8,  1 863” 
yielded  further  values,  and,  working  in  this  way,  the  three — with  the  President 
hovering  about  anxiously — unlocked  the  cipher  in  about  four  hours.  It  read:

A special  cabinet  meeting  was  called,  and  by  7 : 30  that  evening  Assistant 
Secretary  of  War  Charles  A.  Dana  had  started  for  New  York  to  take  charge 
of  an  investigation.  Two  days  later,  another  cryptogram  addressed  to  Keith 
was  intercepted  and  promptly  solved.  “Say  to  Memminger,”  it  read,  “that 
Hilton  will  have  the  machines  all  finished  and  dies  all  cut  ready  for  shipping 
by  the  first  of  January  The  engraving  of  the  plates  is  superb.  ” Christopher  G. 
Memminger  was  the  Confederate  Secretary  of  the  Treasury;  the  letter  made 
it  clear  that  plates  for  printing  rebel  currency  were  being  made  in  New  York. 
Hilton,  the  engraver,  was  easily  located  in  lower  Manhattan,  and  on  the  last 
day  of  the  year  the  U.S.  marshall  raided  his  plant,  seizing  the  plates,  machin- 
ery, dies,  and  several  million  dollars  worth  of  already-printed  bonds  and 
money.  The  plot  was  broken  up,  the  Confederacy  deprived  of  badly  needed 
plates  for  printing  its  paper  money.  For  their  central  role  in  all  this,  the  three 
junior  cryptanalysts  each  received  the  handsome  raise  of  $25  a month. 

The  men  in  gray,  who  sometimes  could  not  read  their  own  messages, 
could  never  solve  the  Union’s.  The  ravings  of  the  Delphic  oracle  must  have 
seemed  more  clear  than  messages  in  the  federal  route  transposition.  Though 
many  of  the  North’s  estimated  6,500,000  telegrams  were  in  cipher,  though  the 
Confederates  tapped  the  Union  wires,  though  their  cavalry  raids  must  have 
captured  parallel  plain  and  cipher  copies  of  messages,  though  the  system  had 
intrinsic  weaknesses — though  they  had  all  these  clues,  the  rebels  never  sorted 
out  the  Yankee  word-thicket.  This  would  be  incredible  if  they  had  not  vouched 
for  it  themselves  by  publishing  a number  of  messages  in  their  newspapers  with 
a general  request  for  solution.  Even  the  capture  of  two  of  the  ciphers 
themselves — No.  12  in  July  of  1864  and  No.  1 in  September — failed  to  help. 
The  Yankees  simply  got  out  a new  list  of  routes  and  jargon  words,  and  the 
result  was  always  more  than  the  rebels  could  handle. 

Appomattox  itself  did  not  still  the  cryptologic  reverberations  of  the  Civil 
War.  In  the  trunk  of  John  Wilkes  Booth,  found  in  his  room  at  the  National 
Hotel  after  he  was  shot,  officials  discovered  a Vigenere  tableau.  This  was 
introduced  into  evidence  at  the  trial  of  the  eight  Southern  sympathizers 
charged  with  conspiring  to  assassinate  the  President  in  an  obvious  attempt  to 
link  them  with  the  actual  killer,  though  no  one  testified  to  their  use  of  the 
cipher.  The  prosecution  then  sought  to  show  that  the  crime  had  been  insti- 
gated by  the  Confederate  government  by  exhibiting  a rebel  “cipher  reel,” 
which  Major  Eckert  averred  to  be  identical  with  the  Booth  cipher.  This 


221 


Crises  of  the  Union 

curiosity,  captured  on  a shelf  in  the  Richmond  office  of  Judah  P.  Benjamin, 
Confederate  Secretary  of  State,  simply  consisted  of  a Vigenere  tableau 
wrapped  around  a cylinder;  over  this,  an  arm  supported  two  indicators  that 
presumably  pointed  out  the  letters.  It  deciphered  no  messages  at  the  trial.  The 
burlesque  reached  a climax  when  a North  Carolina  pile-driver  named  Charles 
Deuel  described  how  he  and  a friend  solved  a cipher  that  he  found  floating  in 
the  water  near  where  he  was  working.  The  plaintext,  signed  “No.  5,”  began: 
“I  am  happy  to  inform  you  that  Pet  has  done  his  work  well.  He  is  safe,  and 
Old  Abe  is  in  hell.”  What  connection  all  these  displays  had  with  the  accused 
was  never  made  clear,  but  they  were  hanged  anyway. 

At  about  the  same  time  that  Booth  and  others  were  being  hunted  down 
and  captured,  Jefferson  Davis  was  using  the  third  Vigenere  key  to  compose 
the  last  official  cryptogram  of  the  Confederacy.  Sent  to  his  secretary  on  April 
24,  almost  two  weeks  after  Lee’s  surrender,  it  was  a message  of  futile  defiance 
ordering  “active  operations  to  be  resumed  in  forty-eight  hours.”  No  one 
knows  who  chose  this  final  key  of  the  Confederacy,  or  why,  but  in  view  of 
Davis’  own  impending  fall  and  the  black  days  of  Reconstruction  that  lay 
just  ahead,  it  gleams  as  the  most  somberly  prophetic  in  the  whole  history  of 
cryptology:  COME  RETRIBUTION. 

On  the  morning  of  Monday,  October  7,  1878,  the  New  York  Tribune 
trumpeted  forth  one  of  the  great  scoops  of  American  journalism.  Under  the 
two-column  headline  “The  Captured  Cipher  Telegrams,”  the  lead  story  of 
the  day  blared  the  plaintext  of  cryptogram  after  cryptogram  that  the  Tribune 
had  solved.  The  messages,  which  hearkened  back  to  the  most  famous  electoral 
dispute  in  American  history,  were  the  first  to  play  a vital  role  in  American 
politics. 

After  the  popular  votes  were  counted  in  the  presidential  election  of  1876, 
the  Democratic  candidate,  Samuel  J.  Tilden,  held  a clear  lead  of  250,000 
ballots  over  his  Republican  opponent,  Rutherford  B.  Hayes.  But  which  way 
the  deciding  electoral  college  vote  went  depended  on  which  of  the  double  and 
conflicting  returns  from  Florida,  Louisiana,  South  Carolina,  and  Oregon 
were  accepted  as  valid.  Congress  created  a special  electoral  commission  to 
settle  the  matter;  by  a straight  party  vote  of  8 to  7,  it  awarded  all  22  contested 
electoral  votes  to  Hayes.  This  gave  him  a majority  of  1 in  the  college — and 
the  Presidency. 

During  the  tumultuous  legislative  session  that  followed,  a Congressional 
committee  was  appointed  to  look  into  persistent  Democratic  rumors  of 
Republican  purchase  of  electors’  votes.  As  part  of  its  investigation,  the  com- 
mittee subpoenaed  641  political  telegrams  out  of  the  29,275  that  had  clattered 
back  and  forth  between  politicians  and  their  agents  in  the  four  states — the  vast 
majority  having  been  burned  by  Western  Union  to  publicize  the  privacy  of  the 
correspondence  entrusted  to  it.  A large  bundle  of  the  impounded  wires  kicked 
around  the  committee  room  during  the  summer  of  1878,  and,  through  a com- 


222 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


plicated  chain  beginning  with  a committee  messenger  and  ending  with  the 
Republican  National  Chairman,  27  of  the  telegrams  in  cipher  were  leaked  to 
the  Republican-leaning  Tribune  in  the  hope  that  they  might  embarrass  the 
Democrats. 

A few  weeks  earlier,  Manton  Marble,  one  of  Tilden’s  closest  political 
advisors,  had  written  an  open  letter  to  the  New  York  Sun  contrasting  dark 
Republican  practices  with  Tilden’s  station  in  “the  keen  bright  sunlight  of 
publicity.”  Whitelaw  Reid,  the  Tribune's  brilliant  editor,  took  a suggestion 
of  the  Republican  chairman  and  inserted  the  cipher  telegrams  in  editorials  as 
subtle  commentaries  on  Marble’s  letter.  The  Democrats  squirmed  as  the 
Tribune  staff  played  impishly  upon  the  ciphertexts.  Was  this  cryptic  mumbo- 
jumbo  the  vaunted  Democratic  candor?  But  as  more  and  more  dispatches 
poured  in  upon  Reid  from  other  G.O.P.  sympathizers,  he  conceived  a broader 
scheme.  Reckoning  that  any  negotiations  that  had  to  be  conducted  beneath 
the  cloak  of  cipher  would  mightily  discomfit  the  Democrats  if  drawn  from 
under  that  cover,  he  set  to  work  to  get  them  read. 

Prompted  by  hints  in  the  editorials,  numerous  subscribers  offered  sugges- 
tions for  their  solution.  Schuyler  Colfax,  who  had  been  Vice  President  during 
Grant’s  first  term  and  had  been  interested  in  cryptology  since  his  teens, 
referred  Reid  to  several  magazine  articles  on  the  subject,  but  they  proved 
useless.  William  M.  Evarts,  the  Secretary  of  State,  had  a good  idea:  get  a 
student  of  mathematics  to  unearth  the  law  on  which  the  messages  were  based. 
But  this  only  promised;  it  did  not  produce.  Reid  even  tried  the  approach 
direct  when  he  ran  into  Tilden  at  fashionable  Saratoga  that  August:  “I  told 
him  that  we  had  all  the  cipher  dispatches  that  went  between  his  house  and 
Florida,  and  asked  him,  laughingly,  for  the  key.  I told  him  we  couldn’t  make 
head  or  tail  to  them,  and  wanted  him  to  help  us.  He  smiled  and  blushed, 
innocent  as  a baby,  and  passed  on.”  Things  were  getting  nowhere. 

Meanwhile,  the  Detroit  Post  had  learned  from  a former  business  partner 
of  J.  N.  H.  Patrick,  one  of  the  Democratic  agents,  that  the  Democrats  had 
couched  their  electoral  communications  to  Oregon  in  the  same  dictionary 
code  that  Patrick  had  used  in  his  mining  ventures.  The  encoder  had  looked 
up  the  word  in  the  edition  of  the  Household  English  Dictionary  that  was 
published  at  London  in  1 876,  noted  the  word’s  numerical  position  on  the  page, 
and  took  the  corresponding  word  four  pages  to  the  front  of  the  book  as  the 
code  equivalent.  The  decoder  had  reversed  the  process.  For  instance,  the  most 
damning  of  the  Oregon  messages  read,  in  codetext:

read:

J.  N.  H.  Patrick 

On  September  4,  one  of  the  Tribune's  editors,  John  R.  G.  Hassard,  basing 
his  work  on  the  Detroit  Post's  revelation,  set  forth  3i  columns  of  crypto- 
grams and  translations  that  showed  that  the  Democrats  had  sought  to  buy  a 
Republican  elector  for  $10,000  and  that  the  deal  had  fallen  through  only 
through  delays  in  transmission. 

But  the  Household  English  Dictionary  was  not  the  key  so  urgently  desired 
to  the  messages  from  the  other  three  states.  With  no  outside  help  forthcoming 
for  their  solution,  Reid  set  his  staff  to  work  on  the  problem  in  earnest. 

Hassard,  then  42,  had  become  managing  editor  in  all  but  name  on  the 
death  of  Horace  Greeley  in  1872.  A tall,  lanky  man  with  sandy  hair,  side- 
whiskers,  and  hazel  eyes,  always  spruce,  with  a no-nonsense  manner,  he  was 
gifted  with  a charm  of  style  and  breadth  of  culture  that  showed  in  his  graceful 
editorials.  He  had  converted  to  Catholicism  at  15 — a courageous  act  in  the 
heyday  of  Know-Nothingism— and,  after  graduating  from  St.  John’s  College 
at  the  head  of  his  class,  abandoned  his  plans  for  the  priesthood  only  because 
of  ill  health.  He  served  as  secretary  to  the  first  archbishop  of  New  York,  John 
Hughes,  whose  biography  he  later  wrote.  His  dispatches  to  the  Tribune  from 
Bayreuth  on  the  premiere  of  the  Nibelungen  Ring  series  in  1876  did  more  to 
bring  Wagner’s  music  to  America  than  perhaps  anything  else  up  to  that  time. 
Hassard  took  on  the  challenge  of  the  cryptograms  himself,  and  worked  on 
them  so  uninterruptedly  that  a cold  hung  on  and  developed  into  tuberculosis. 
He  spent  the  next  ten  years  in  search  of  health,  but  succumbed  in  1888. 

Soon  after  Hassard  started  his  task,  another  member  of  the  Tribune  staff 
became  interested  and  took  up  the  puzzles  independently.  This  was  Colonel 
William  M.  Grosvenor,  who  had  become  economic  editor  of  the  Tribune  in 
1 875,  three  years  earlier.  A burly,  forceful  man,  then  43,  with  bristly  eyebrows, 
long  hair  and  beard,  and  a leonine  head,  he  had  demonstrated  his  statistical 
skill  while  editor  of  the  St.  Louis  Democrat  by  making  an  elaborate  com- 
parison between  the  whisky  production  of  the  St.  Louis  distillers  and  the 
revenue  accruing  therefrom  to  the  government.  It  clearly  indicated  Iraud  on 
the  part  of  the  liquor  interest  and  led  to  exposure  of  the  notorious  Whisky 
Ring.  A native  of  Massachusetts,  he  had  commanded  a regiment  of  Negro 
troops  in  the  Civil  War.  Grosvenor  later  became  editor  of  the  prestigious

Duns  Review  and  was  frequently  consulted  by  government  experts  on  tariff 
and  currency  legislation.  His  integrity  in  these  matters  was  so  great  that  on  one 
occasion  his  advice  cost  him  a fortune  in  the  stock  of  a printing  firm.  He  was 
gifted  in  mathematics  and  languages,  was  one  of  the  most  expert  billiard 
players  in  New  York,  could  carry  on  three  games  of  chess  simultaneously,  and 
more  than  held  his  own  at  tennis  and  whist.  He  died  in  1900. 

Grosvenor  and  Hassard,  each  in  his  own  home,  wrestled  with  the  riddles 
and  obstinacies  of  an  unfamiliar  science.  They  could  not  have  known  it,  but 
not  only  were  they  mastering  a problem  that  had  repulsed  many,  they  were 
also  breaking  new  ground  in  that  science.

A cipher  telegram  offering  the  electoral  votes  of  Florida  for  $200,000,  solved  and

“They  both  did  extremely  well,”  Reid  said  later,  “worked  independently, 
compared  notes  loyally  and  altogether  cooperated  in  a charming  way  in  a 
highly  important  piece  of  work.  Hassard  was  a little  earlier  in  the  field,  and 
to  that  extent  deserves  special  credit;  but  Grosvenor  was  equally  keen,  and, 
as  well  as  I can  now  remember  it,  about  equally  successful.  Sometimes  he  and 
Hassard  would  attack  the  same  despatch  on  different  lines,  and  after  being 
foiled  again  and  again,  would  finally  reach  the  solution  the  same  evening, 
Hassard  in  Eighteenth  Street  and  Grosvenor  out  at  Englewood.” 

Unknown  to  them,  a young  mathematician  from  the  U.S.  Naval  Observa-

the  Naval  Observatory  three  years  later.  In  1879,  the  year  following  his  work 
on  the  cipher  telegrams,  he  was  appointed  librarian  there.  In  1885,  he  became 
president  of  the  University  of  California  and  director  of  the  Lick  Observatory, 
relinquishing  the  presidency  in  1888  on  completion  of  the  observatory.  He 
founded  the  Astronomical  Society  of  the  Pacific,  organized  five  eclipse 
expeditions,  and  edited  the  observatory’s  publications.  From  1901  until  his 
death  in  1914  he  was  librarian  at  West  Point,  adding  30,000  volumes  to  the 
collection,  cataloging  it,  and  issuing  many  bibliographies. 

Holden  had  been  attracted  by  the  “novel  and  ingenious  character”  of  the 
cryptograms.  “By  September  7,  1878,”  he  said  later,  “I  was  in  possession  of  a 
rule  by  which  any  key  to  the  most  difficult  and  ingenious  of  these  . . . could 
infallibly  be  found.”  He  approached  the  Tribune,  which  had  liked  Evarts’ 
idea  of  hiring  a mathematician,  and  Hassard  sent  on  a quantity  of  dispatches. 
But  Hassard  and  Grosvenor  had  independently  reached  the  theory  of  solution 
that  Holden  had,  and  furthermore  had  solved  some  messages  before  he  did. 
None  of  Holden’s  solutions  reached  the  Tribune  before  Hassard  and  Grosve- 
nor had  solved  those  messages,  Reid  said,  and  in  general  his  work  was 
regarded  as  corroborative. 

The  most  important  messages,  and  those  to  which  the  new  theory  of 
solution  applied,  were  enciphered  in  a form  of  word  transposition  grievously 
deteriorated  from  the  excellent  Civil  War  system  that  had  evidently  inspired 
it.  Only  four  keys  were  employed,  one  each  for  telegrams  of  15,  20,  25,  and  30 
words,  with  longer  telegrams  being  enciphered  in  parts  by  two  or  more  keys. 
Sometimes  deciphering  keys  were  used  to  encipher.  Code  disguised  some  of 
the  proper  names  and  important  words.  The  enciphering  key  for  25  words 
(18,  12,  6, 25,  14,  1,  16, 11,  21,  5, 19,  2, 17, 24,  9,  22,  7, 4,  10,  8,  23,  20,  3,  13,  15) 
served  to  encipher  this  honest  offer  of  corruption  from  Tallahassee:

In  the  code  list,  Bolivia  stood  for  proposition,  Russia  for  Tilden,  London  for 
canvassing  board,  France  for  Governor  Stearns,  moselle  for  two,  Glasgow 
for  hundred,  Edinburgh  for  thousand,  and  moses  for  Manton  Marble.  As 
transmitted  to  New  York,  the  message  read: 

CERTIFICATE  REQUIRED  TO  MOSES  DECISION  HAVE  LONDON  HOUR  for 
BOLIVIA  OF  JUST  AND  EDINBURGH  AT  MOSELLE  HAND  A ANY  OVER

The  reply  to  that  is  extant;  it  was  both  clear  and  in  clear:  “Telegram  here. 
Proposition  too  high.” 

The  Hassard-Grosvenor-Holden  theory  of  solution  of  messages  like  this 


226 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


fed  upon  the  great  quantity  of  dispatches  in  each  key.  It  is  now  considered  the 
general  solution  for  all  transposition  ciphers,  because  it  works  on  any  trans- 
position whenever  two  or  more  cryptograms  of  the  same  length  in  the  same 
key  are  available  for  analysis.  The  method,  which  they  developed  empirically 
for  the  first  time  in  cryptology,  has  become  known  as  “multiple  anagram- 
ming,  ’ and  though  Holden  did  not  use  that  term,  he  gave  a good  description 
of  the  technique:  “There  is  one  way,  and  only  one  way,  in  which  the  general 
problem  can  be  solved,  and  that  is  to  take  two  messages,  A and  B,  of  the 
same  number  of  words,  and  to  number  the  words  in  each;  then  to  arrange 
message  A with  its  words  in  an  order  which  will  make  sense,  and  to  arrange  the 
words  of  message  B in  the  same  order.  There  will  be  one  order — and  only  one — 
in  which  the  two  messages  will  simultaneously  make  sense.  This  is  the  key.” 

Holden’s  description  makes  explicit  one  requirement  of  successful  opera- 
tion of  multiple  anagramming  (that  the  two  messages  be  the  same  length) 
but  presupposes  the  other  (that  their  keys  be  the  same).  The  technique  rests  on 
the  fact  that,  if  two  messages  of  the  same  length  are  transposed  in  the  same 
system  with  identical  keys,  their  individual  words  will  wind  up  in  the  same 
relative  positions.  To  put  it  differently,  if  the  first  word  of  the  plaintext 
becomes  the  1 5th  word  of  the  cryptogram  in  the  first  message,  the  first  word 
of  the  plaintext  of  the  second  message  will  equally  wind  up  in  the  15th  posi- 
tion of  the  second  cryptogram.  This  is  transposition’s  version  of  like  causes 
producing  like  effects,  and  the  principle  holds  for  all  transposition  systems, 
letter  as  well  as  word,  irrespective  of  their  mixing  process. 

The  principle  may  be  illustrated  with  two  five-letter  cryptograms  en- 
ciphered with  the  same  key:  ghint  and  owlcn.  Suppose  that  the  cryptanalyst 
begins  trying  to  reconstruct  the  plaintext  of  the  first  message  by  assuming 
that  it  begins  with  th.  This  implies  an  encipherment  key  which  moved  the 
first  plaintext  letter  ( t , in  this  message)  to  the  fifth  position  (in  ghint)  and  the 
second  plaintext  letter  ( h ) to  the  second  position  (in  ghint).  The  cryptanalyst 
can  determine  that  the  same  key  would  require  the  second  message  to  begin 
with  nw — hardly  a promising  beginning.  If  the  cryptanalyst  now  tries  to 
anagram  the  second  message  instead,  he  might  try  cl  as  a starter.  The  cor- 
responding moves  in  the  first  cryptogram  would  bring  n and  i together  at  the 
head  of  the  message.  This  gives  good  possibilities  in  both  messages,  which  is, 
of  course,  more  desirable.  The  cryptanalyst  will  continue  juggling  the  two 
messages,  checking  one  against  the  other,  until  he  reconstructs  them  both  as 
night  and  clown.  The  key  he  recovers  will  solve  any  other  five-letter  crypto- 
grams enciphered  by  it.  The  process  must  be  done  individually  for  each  key 
and  each  cryptogram  of  different  length.  Multiple  anagramming  cannot  work 
with  just  a single  message  because  without  any  control  the  single  message 
could  be  anagrammed  into  too  many  equally  likely  texts,  ghint  alone,  for 
example,  could  be  unscrambled  to  make  thing  as  well  as  night,  and  there  is 
no  cross-check  to  tell  which  is  right. 

The  word-transposition  system  carried  the  most  explosive  and  the  greatest

Crises  of  the  Union 

number  of  messages  sent  by  the  Democratic  politicians,  but  it  was  by  no  means 
the  only  one.  Messages  from  Florida  and  South  Carolina  were  evidently 
encoded  by  a dictionary,  but  the  one  used  for  the  Oregon  disclosures  did  not 
unlock  them.  The  three  tyro  cryptanalysts  had  independently  noticed  that 
these  dispatches  included  the  word  geodesy,  which  is  a rather  unusual  term 
for  the  pocket  dictionary  that  they  reasoned  would  probably  be  used.  Holden 
found  the  right  one  after  an  hour  and  a half’s  search  in  the  Library  of  Congress ; 
he  telegraphed  the  news  to  the  Tribune  just  as  a bleary-eyed  staff  member, 
who  had  examined  40  or  50  volumes  without  success,  was  about  to  go  out 
and  check  the  one  that  Hassard  and  Grosvenor  rightly  suspected—  Webster's 
Pocket  Dictionary.  It  was  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  Oregon  dictionary, 
though  the  number  of  pages  turned  to  the  front  to  select  the  codeword  varied 
from  one  to  five. 

The  Democrats  also  used  pairs  of  numbers  in  a mon  alphabetic  substitu- 
tion. Hassard  broke  this  system  by  guessing  that  the  patterned  ciphertext 
84  66  33  87  66  27  27  mirrored  canvass.  He  cracked  a checkerboard  substitu- 
tion when  he  divined  that  ityyitns  in  a partially  enciphered  telegram  from 
Florida  stood  for  the  name  of  the  county  of  Dade.  The  coordinates  of  the 
checkerboard  (which  also  served  for  the  two-digit  cipher)  proved  to  be  ten 
different  letters  that  spelled  a phrase  of  extraordinary  suitability:

Of  the  400  dispatches  that  were  given  to  Hassard  and  Grosvenor,  all  but 
three  (in  a cipher  not  used  elsewhere)  were  translated.  The  Democrats,  unaware 
that  their  own  machinations  were  being  bared,  raised  the  cry  of  fraud  in  the 
presidential  election  as  the  midterm  campaign  for  Congress  grew  hot.  On 
October  3,  1878,  the  Tribune  reported  that  solution  of  the  dispatches  had  been 
completed  and  published  a few  of  them  as  a hint  for  the  Democrats  to  confess. 
But  they  said  nothing,  and  four  days  later  the  Tribune  thundered  out  the  story 
of  Democratic  intrigue  in  Florida  and  Louisiana.  The  first  story  detailed  the 
operations  of  the  ciphers;  the  second,  next  day,  exposed  the  texts  of  the 
telegrams.  On  October  16,  the  South  Carolina  shenaningans  came  out.  Their

sum  was  that  Colonel  William  T.  Pelton,  Tilden’s  nephew  and  confidential 
secretary,  had  bargained  through  Marble  and  others  for  electoral  votes. 

The  results  were  sensational.  The  public  marvelled  at  the  ingenuity  of  the 
cipher-solvers.  Thousands  of  readers  tested  the  keys  and  satisfied  themselves 
as  to  the  accuracy  of  the  solutions.  The  Democrats  argued  that  the  telegrams 
were  strictly  for  Pelton’s  information,  but  it  seemed  clear  that  only  Pelton’s 
hesitation  at  the  price  and  the  subsequent  bungling  and  delay  subverted  his 
intentions.  The  Tribune  had  prepared  its  expose  thoroughly  and  presented  it 
skillfully;  even  its  Democratic  rival,  the  Sun,  was  forced  to  a grudging  tribute. 
The  timing,  too,  was  perfect : election  was  only  a few  weeks  off.  In  that  election, 
the  G.O.P.  made  emphatic  gains  in  Congress.  New  York,  Pennsylvania, 
Massachusetts,  and  Connecticut  voted,  as  the  Tribune  inferred  with  pardon- 
able pride,  to  rebuke  the  cipher  fraud. 

But  the  effects  did  not  stop  there.  The  telegrams  had  been  addressed  to 
Pelton  at  15  Gramercy  Square,  New  York,  Tilden’s  home,  and  though  Tilden, 
haggard  and  with  his  perpetual  cold,  swore  before  the  Congressional  in- 
vestigating committee  that  he  had  no  personal  knowledge  of  what  his  nephew 
was  doing  in  his  house,  and  that  anything  that  was  done  was  done  without 
his  permission,  his  reputation  was  sullied.  The  disclosures  ended  his  presiden- 
tial aspirations.  As  his  old  supporter,  the  Sun,  sadly  conceded,  “Mr.  Tilden 
will  not  again  be  the  Presidential  candidate  of  any  party.” 

In  fact  he  was  not,  and  in  the  election  of  1880,  James  A.  Garfield,  a 
personal  friend  of  Reid’s,  defeated  Winfield  S.  Hancock,  the  Democratic 
candidate,  by  only  7,000  votes  out  of  9,000,000  in  the  popular  tally  but  by 
an  unchallengeable  214  to  155  in  the  electoral  ballot.  Even  a sympathetic 
biographer  of  Tilden  acknowledged  that  “As  a result  of  the  cipher  telegrams 
the  Republicans  won  an  advantage  which  probably  gave  them  the  national 
election  of  1880.  Much  of  the  public  became  convinced  that  the  millionaire 
candidate  for  the  Presidency  had  permitted  his  party  directors  to  dip  into 
his  purse  to  win  a decision  for  the  party  that  was  willing  to  pay  the  highest 
price.”  Cryptanalysis  had  helped  elect  a President.  The  Tribune  s triumph 
stood  forth  as  one  of  the  first  great  journalistic  exposes  of  governmental  cor- 
ruption, which  helped  elevate  American  newspapers  to  their  role  of  public 
watchdog.  It  also  carried  the  Tribune  into  the  citadel  of  Republican  power. 
Reid  later  banqueted  at  its  tables  when  he  was  named  ambassador  to  the 
Court  of  St.  James’s.  But  perhaps  the  most  lasting  value  of  the  Hassard- 
Grosvenor  cryptanalysis  and  its  dramatic  disclosure  by  the  Tribune  was  noted 
by  Reid’s  biographer:  “It  had  pilloried  once  and  for  all  the  single  manifesta- 
tion in  our  annals  of  the  idea  that  the  Presidency  was  a purchasable  honor.

THE  PROFESSOR,  THE  SOLDIER, 

AND  THE  MAN  ON  DEVIL’S  ISLAND 

ONLY  a FEW  books  in  the  history  of  any  science  may  be  called  great.  Some 
of  these  report  a technical  innovation  that  radically  alters  the  content  of  the 
science.  Through  the  19th  century,  Alberti  s and  Kasiski’s  were  the  two  great 
books  of  this  kind  in  cryptology.  Such  books  look  inward. 

Other  great  books  look  outward.  They  bring  the  science  up  to  date— make 
it  consonant  with  its  time— and  so  renew  its  utility  to  men.  This  they  do  by 
assimilating  developments  in  relevant  fields  (for  example,  improvements 
in  instrumentation),  by  summing  up  the  lessons  of  recent  experience  and 
deducing  their  meaning  for  the  current  age,  and  by  reorganizing  the 
concepts  of  the  science  according  to  this  new  knowledge.  This  does  not 
mean  simple  popularization,  though  such  a work  usually  does  have  an 
organic  persuasiveness.  Rather,  it  amounts  to  a reorientation,  a new 
perspective. 

For  300  years,  the  only  great  book  of  this  kind  in  cryptology  was  Porta’s. 
He  was  the  first  to  delineate  a coherent  image  of  cryptology.  His  ideas  re- 
mained viable  so  long  because  cryptology  underwent  no  essential  change; 
communication  was  by  messenger,  and  consequently  the  nomenclator  reigned. 
But  his  views  no  longer  sufficed  after  the  invention  of  the  telegraph.  New 
conditions  demanded  new  theses,  new  insights.  And  in  1883  cryptology  got 
them  in  the  form  of  its  second  great  book  of  the  outward-looking  kind.  La 
Cryptographs  militaire. 

Its  author  was  born  Jean-Guillaume-Hubert-Victor-Franqois-Alexandre- 
Auguste  Kerckhoffs  von  Nieuwenhof  on  January  19,  1835,  at  Nuth,  Holland, 
son  of  a well-to-do  landlord  and  a member  of  one  of  the  oldest  and  most 
honorable  families  of  the  Flemish  duchy  of  Limburg.  He  went  to  school  at 
a little  seminary  near  Aachen.  Afterward,  to  improve  his  knowledge  of 
English,  he  lived  in  Britain  for  a year  and  a half,  then  returned  to  the  Univer- 
sity of  Liege,  where  he  received  two  degrees,  one  in  letters,  one  in  science. 
After  teaching  modern  languages  for  four  years  at  two  schools  in  Holland 
and  joining  a number  of  literary  societies  there,  he  accompanied  a young 
American,  Clarence  Prentice,  son  of  the  founder  of  the  Louisville  Journal, 

230 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island  231 

through  England,  Germany,  and  France  as  traveling  secretary,  then  went  to 
Meaux,  near  Paris,  where  he  again  taught  modern  languages. 

In  1863,  he  obtained  the  chair  of  modern  languages  at  the  high  school  at 
Melun,  a large  town  25  miles  southeast  of  Paris.  The  next  year  he  married  a 
girl  from  the  area  and  in  1865,  when  he  was  30,  they  had  their  only  child, 
a daughter,  Pauline.  He  stayed  at  Melun  for  10  years,  teaching  English  and 
German.  He  supplemented  his  salary  of  about  1,600  francs  by  taking  students 
in  to  lodge  with  him — a practice  that  was  officially  prohibited  but  winked  at. 

During  these  years  he  participated  in  a variety  of  activities  that  show  the 
great  diversity  of  his  interests.  He  gave  lectures  on  the  formation  of  languages 
and  on  literature,  founded  a society  for  the  encouragement  of  education  in 
Melun,  gave  free  courses  in  English  and  Italian,  served  as  delegate  of  the 
local  branch  of  the  French  Society  of  Archaeology  to  the  international  con- 
gress at  Bonn  in  1868,  and  got  embroiled  in  some  minor  political  difficulties 
after  the  French  defeat  of  1870.  His  learning  was  broad  enough  for  him  to 
fill  in  at  different  times  for  teachers  of  Latin,  Greek,  history,  and  mathe- 
matics. 

By  this  time  he  had  shortened  his  name  to  Auguste  Kerckhoffs.  Bearded, 
dignified,  slow  of  speech,  Kerckhoffs,  despite  an  inability  to  maintain  disci- 
pline in  his  classes  and  some  eccentricities  of  character,  was  a “learned, 
zealous,  capable”  teacher  who  awoke  his  students’  interest  in  their  work; 
his  superiors  said  “his  students  like  him  and  work  with  success.”  Thus  when 
a hostile  official  wanted  to  turn  down  Kerckhoffs’  request  for  a leave  for 
further  studies,  he  discovered  that  the  teacher  had  “ardent  protectors,” 
and  the  leave  was  granted. 

Kerckhoffs  went  from  1873  to  1876  to  the  universities  of  Bonn  and 
Tubingen,  getting  his  Ph.D.  He  earned  his  living  by  teaching  the  young 
Count  de  Sao  Mamede,  who  later  became  secretary  to  the  king  of  Portugal; 
Kerckhoffs  was  made  a commander  of  the  Order  of  Christ  for  this.  He  then 
returned  to  Paris,  where  he  worked  as  a private  instructor,  teaching  two 
younger  sons  of  the  Sao  Mamede  family.  He  demonstrated  an  interest  in 
things  military  by  applying  for  the  chair  of  German  at  the  Ecole  Militaire 
Superieure  in  1878,  losing  it  because  a clerk  failed  to  note  that  he  had  become 
naturalized  as  a French  citizen  in  1873.  In  1881,  Kerckhoffs  became  professor 
of  German  at  the  Ecole  des  Hautes  Etudes  Commerciales  and  at  the  Ecole 
Arago,  both  in  Paris.  It  was  during  this  time  that,  aged  47,  he  wrote  La 
Cryptographie  militaire.  It  was  not  his  first  book:  he  had  already  written  a 
Flemish  grammar,  an  English  grammar,  a German  verb  manual,  a study 
(in  German)  on  the  origins  of  German  drama,  and  a work  examining  the 
relation  of  art  to  religion. 

His  busiest  years  followed  the  publication  of  La  Cryptographie  militaire. 
A new  international  language  called  Volapiik  (“World-Speak")  had  been 
invented  by  a German  priest,  Johann  Martin  Schleyer.  About  1885,  it  caught 
on  in  France,  and  flashed  with  express-train  speed  all  over  the  country,  not

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


only  among  intellectuals  but  among  all  classes : it  was  even  heard  in  the  streets. 
From  France  it  radiated  throughout  the  world.  The  most  active  propagandist 
of  Volapiik  was  Auguste  Kerckhoffs,  who,  at  the  second  Volapiik  congress  in 
Munich  in  1887,  was  acclaimed  director  (“Dilekel,”  in  Volapiik)  of  the  Inter- 
national Academy  of  Volapiik.  To  this  body  were  submitted  questions  of 
the  grammar,  vocabulary,  and  orthography  of  the  expanding  tongue. 

As  secretary  of  the  French  Association  for  the  Propagation  of  Volapiik, 
Kerckhoffs  proselytized  the  artificial  language  with  ability  and  vigor.  In  1888, 
182  textbooks  on  Volapiik  appeared — a publication  rate  of  one  every  other 
day — and  the  Macy’s  of  Paris,  the  Grands  Magazins  des  Printemps,  spon- 
sored courses  in  it.  By  1889,  25  periodicals  in  or  about  the  language  were 
being  published  and  283  Volapiik  clubs  were  meeting  all  over  the  globe.  When 
the  third  Volapiik  congress  was  held  at  Paris  in  May  of  1889,  with  Kerck- 
hoffs presiding,  even  the  waiters  and  porters  conversed  in  World-Speak.  A 
new  Golden  Age  of  brotherhood,  unencumbered  by  the  chains  of  Babel, 
seemed  to  shimmer  just  ahead. 

It  was  a mirage.  For  the  congresses,  which  seemed  to  be  the  harbingers  of 
that  great  day,  were  actually  symptoms  of  critical  tensions  within  the  move- 
ment. Schleyer’s  goal  of  creating  the  richest  and  most  perfect  literary  lan- 
guage, in  which  he  was  supported  by  the  German  Volapiikists,  clashed  with 
the  desire  of  Kerckhoffs  and  the  other  active  Volapiikists  to  have  the  simplest 
and  most  practical  language  for  commerce  and  science.  From  the  beginning, 
Kerckhoffs  had  eliminated  from  his  grammatical  manuals  some  of  the  forms 
that  Schleyer  had  carried  over  in  Volapiik  from  his  native  German,  such  as 
the  endings  for  the  jussive  and  optative  moods  of  verbs.  But  the  priest  in- 
sisted that,  as  the  father  of  Volapiik,  he  should  have  the  final  decision  on  any 
changes.  The  tensions  mounted,  and  when  the  Academy  refused  to  grant 
Schleyer  the  full  veto  he  wanted,  the  movement  broke  in  two. 

It  splintered  into  bickering  factions  entirely  unable  to  agree  when  Kerck- 
hoffs submitted  to  the  Academy,  not  individual  questions,  but  a complete 
grammar,  and  other  members  of  the  Academy  retorted  with  projects  of  their 
own.  The  movement  crumpled  with  unbelievable  swiftness:  in  1889,  it  seemed 
as  though  it  would  conquer  the  world;  in  1890,  it  was  moribund.  Kerckhoffs 
resigned  as  Dilekel  in  1891,  and,  by  1902,  of  the  estimated  210,000  enthusiasts 
the  language  had  once  had,  only  159  remained  on  its  List  of  Correspondents, 
and  only  four  little  clubs  clung  weakly  to  life.  Kerckhoffs’  Corns  complet  de 
Volapiik,  his  Dictionnaire  Volapiik- Francois  et  Francois- Volapiik,  his  Vollstan- 
diger  Lehrgang  des  Volapiik  remain  only  as  forgotten  monuments  to  a splendid 
dream. 

Crushed  and  perhaps  embittered  by  the  collapse  of  what  had  seemed  so 
needful  and  so  certain,  Kerckhoffs  one  day  exploded  with  some  intemperate 
criticisms  of  the  handling  of  the  state’s  school  examinations  so  that  his  con- 
tract at  the  Ecole  des  Hautes  Etudes  Commerciales  was  not  renewed  in  1891. 
It  was  only  through  the  intervention  of  influential  friends  that  he  managed 


233 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

to  get  a post  teaching  German  at  the  high  school  at  Mont-de-Marsan,  near 
Bordeaux.  Here,  his  superiors  reported  on  him:  “Very  diverse  and  extended 
knowledge  taught  with  more  method,  exactness  and  precision  than  I would 
have  expected  in  a spirit  that  embraces  so  many  things.  Highly  regarded  and 
highly  appreciated.”  The  following  year,  trying  to  get  closer  to  Paris, 
Kerckhoffs  moved  to  the  Brittany  seaport  of  Lorient,  where  he  again  taught 
German.  In  the  middle  of  that  school  year,  his  daughter  died.  He  stuck  it 
out  for  another  year,  but  by  1895,  then  60,  his  health  failing,  his  spirit  broken, 
but  living  in  Paris  not  far  from  the  Sorbonne,  he  applied  for  a year’s  leave. 
He  renewed  it  annually  until  his  death  in  Switzerland,  apparently  while  on 
vacation,  on  August  9,  1903. 

But  if  his  works  on  Volapiik  are  defunct,  his  cryptologic  ideas  still  flourish. 
La  Cryptographie  militaire  first  appeared  as  two  installments  in  the  Journal  des 
Sciences  militaires  in  January  and  February  of  1883,  being  reissued  later  that 
year  as  a paperback  book  by  the  journal’s  publisher.  It  is  the  most  concise 
book  on  cryptology  ever  written.  Kerckhoffs  had  the  instinct  for  the  crypto- 
graphic jugular,  and  he  compressed  into  64  pages  virtually  the  entire  known 
field  of  cryptology,  including  polyalphabetics  with  mixed  alphabets,  en- 
ciphered code,  and  cipher  devices.  The  book  is  also  one  of  the  most  scholarly 
on  cryptology.  Its  footnotes  cite  most  classical  and  many  modern  sources, 
comments  such  as  “This  is  not  the  only  historical  or  bibliographic  error  for 
which  the  Austrian  writer  must  be  reproached”  show  how  carefully  the 
author  has  studied  those  sources.  And  the  book  throbs  with  life.  Kerckhoffs 
selected  an  enciphered  news-service  dispatch  as  the  specimen  for  a demonstra- 
tion solution.  He  discussed  current  German  practice  and  contrasted  it  with  what 
was  then  going  on  in  France.  He  scrutinized  the  most  recent  ciphers,  such 
as  the  Wheatstone  device.  He  concentrated  upon  it  all  his  extraordinary  range 
of  knowledge,  and  it  is  perhaps  significant  that  at  least  three  of  the  great 
books  of  cryptology— Kerckhoffs’,  Alberti’s,  and  Porta’s— were  written  not  by 
narrow  specialists  but  by  well-rounded  men  who  had  one  foot  in  each  of 
what  C.  P.  Snow  would  later  call  “the  two  cultures”  of  science  and  humanities. 

What  makes  Kerckhoffs’  book  great,  however,  is  that  he  sought  answers 
to  the  problems  thrust  upon  cryptology  by  new  conditions,  and  that  the  solu- 
tions he  proposed  were  valid,  well-grounded,  and  meritorious.  The  major 
problem  was  to  find  a system  of  cryptography  that  would  fulfill  the  require- 
ments of  the  new  signal  communications  created  by  the  telegraph  a problem 
that  still  commands  the  interest  of  cryptologists.  While  other  authors  simply 
discussed  various  cipher  systems  rather  as  if  the  science  of  cryptology  existed 
in  a vacuum,  Kerckhoffs  addressed  himself  directly  to  the  issue  of  the  day. 
Indeed,  it  inspired  his  book:  “1  have  therefore  thought  that  it  would  be 
rendering  a service  to  the  persons  who  are  interested  in  the  future  of  military 
cryptography  ...  to  indicate  to  them  the  principles  which  must  guide  them 
in  the  contrivance  or  evaluation  of  every  cipher  intended  tor  war  service.  The 
principles  which  he  enunciated  guide  cryptologists  even  now. 


234 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Kerckhoffs  took  field  ciphers  as  a given ; far  from  realizing  that  they  were 
creatures  of  the  telegraph,  he  thought  that  they  had  existed  in  the  1600s.  But 
this  historical  error  did  not  affect  his  understanding  of  current  conditions.  In 
considering  the  problem  of  finding  a good  field  cipher,  he  saw  that  any  one 
that  was  practical  would  have  to  withstand  the  operational  strains  of  heavy 
traffic.  “It  is  necessary  to  distinguish  carefully  between  a system  of  encipher- 
ment envisioned  for  a momentary  exchange  of  letters  between  several  isolated 
people  and  a method  of  cryptography  intended  to  govern  the  correspondence 
between  different  army  chiefs  for  an  unlimited  time,”  he  wrote.  In  that  one 
sentence,  Kerckhoffs  differentiates  pre-telegraphy  military  communications 
from  post-.  The  sentence  is  pregnant  with  most  of  the  requirements  that 
have  come  to  be  demanded  of  systems  of  military  cryptography,  require- 
ments such  as  simplicity,  reliability,  rapidity,  and  so  on.  This  clear  recogni- 
tion of  the  new  order  constitutes  Kerckhoffs’  first  great  contribution  to 
cryptology. 

The  second  was  to  reaffirm  in  a modern  context  the  principle  that  only 
cryptanalysts  can  know  the  security  of  a cipher  system.  Others  had,  of  course, 
realized  this  before  him : Rossignol  invented  the  two-part  nomenclator  upon 
that  principle,  and  the  English  Decypherers  assessed  and  then  compiled 
England’s  nomenclators  in  the  1700s.  But  it  was  forgotten  after  the  black 
chambers  were  closed,  and  in  any  case  the  simple  criteria  for  appraising  the 
cryptanalytic  resistance  of  a nomenclator  no  longer  applied  to  the  more 
complex  cipher  systems  then  being  proposed.  The  inventors  of  these  systems, 
instead  of  submitting  their  ciphers  to  the  empirical  verdict  of  cryptanalysts, 
sought  instead  to  evaluate  them  a priori.  They  would  calculate  how  many 
centuries  it  would  take  to  run  through  all  the  combinations  necessary  to  solve 
their  cipher,  or  would  argue  how  it  was  logically  impossible  to  break  through  a 
certain  interlocking  feature.  Kerckhoffs  observed  and  diagnosed  the  pheno- 
menon: 

...  1 am  stupefied  to  see  our  scholars  and  our  professors  teach  and  recommend 
for  wartime  use  systems  of  which  the  most  inexperienced  cryptanalyst  would 
certainly  find  the  key  in  less  than  an  hour's  time. 

One  can  hardly  explain  this  excess  of  confidence  in  certain  ciphers  except  by 
the  abandon  into  which  the  suppression  of  black  chambers  and  the  security  of 
postal  communications  have  let  cryptographic  studies  fall;  it  may  likewise  be 
believed  that  the  immoderate  assertions  of  certain  authors,  no  less  than  the  com- 
plete absence  of  any  serious  work  on  the  art  of  solving  secret  writing,  have  largely 
contributed  to  give  currency  to  the  most  erroneous  ideas  about  the  value  of  our 
systems  of  cryptography. 

Reacting  against  this,  Kerckhoffs  demonstrated  that  cryptanalysis  was 
the  only  way  to  enlightenment  in  cryptography,  that  only  by  climbing  the 
steep  and  thorny  path  of  cryptanalysis  could  one  arrive  at  the  truth  about  a 
system  of  cryptography.  Only  solution  could  validly  test  the  security  of  a 
cipher.  Kerckhoffs  never  quite  stated  this  in  so  many  words,  though  he  came 


235 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil’s  Island 

close.  But  his  whole  book  cries  it  out.  La  Cryptographie  militaire  is  essentially 
a tract  on  cryptanalysis ; its  whole  bias  and  emphasis  is  cryptanalytic.  Kerck- 
hoffs established  ordeal  by  cryptanalysis  as  the  only  sure  trial  for  military 
cryptography.  It  is  the  form  of  judgment  which  is  still  used. 

From  these  two  fundamental  principles  for  selecting  usable  field  ciphers, 
Kerckhoffs  deduced  six  specific  requirements:  (1)  the  system  should  be,  if  not 
theoretically  unbreakable,  unbreakable  in  practice;  (2)  compromise  of  the 
system  should  not  inconvenience  the  correspondents;  (3)  the  key  should  be 
rememberable  without  notes  and  should  be  easily  changeable;  (4)  the  crypto- 
grams should  be  transmissible  by  telegraph;  (5)  the  apparatus  or  documents 
should  be  portable  and  operable  by  a single  person;  (6)  the  system  should  be 
easy,  neither  requiring  knowledge  of  a long  list  of  rules  nor  involving  mental 
strain. 

These  requirements  still  comprise  the  ideal  which  military  ciphers  aim  at. 
They  have  been  rephrased,  and  qualities  that  lie  implicit  have  been  made 
explicit.  But  any  modern  cryptographer  would  be  very  happy  if  any  cipher 
fulfilled  all  six. 

Of  course,  it  has  never  been  possible  to  do  that.  There  appears  to  be  a 
certain  incompatibility  among  them  that  makes  it  impossible  to  institute  all 
of  them  at  once.  The  requirement  that  is  usually  sacrificed  is  the  first.  Kerck- 
hoffs argued  strongly  against  the  notion  of  a field  cipher  that  would  simply 
resist  solution  long  enough  for  the  orders  it  transmitted  to  be  carried  out. 
This  was  not  enough,  he  said,  declaring  that  “the  secret  matter  in  com- 
munications sent  over  a distance  very  often  retains  its  importance  beyond 
the  day  on  which  it  was  transmitted.”  He  was  on  the  side  of  the  angels,  but 
a practical  field  cipher  that  is  unbreakable  was  not  possible  in  his  day,  nor  is 
it  today,  and  so  military  cryptography  has  settled  for  field  ciphers  that  delay 
but  do  not  defeat  cryptanalysis. 

Perhaps  the  most  startling  requirement,  at  first  glance,  was  the  second. 
Kerckhoffs  explained  that  by  “system”  he  meant  “the  material  part  of  the 
system;  tableaux,  code  books,  or  whatever  mechanical  apparatus  may  be 
necessary,”  and  not  “the  key  proper.”  Kerckhoffs  here  makes  for  the  first 
time  the  distinction,  now  basic  to  cryptology,  between  the  general  system  and 
the  specific  key.  Why  must  the  general  system  “not  require  secrecy,”  as,  for 
example,  a codebook  requires  it?  Why  must  it  be  “a  process  that  . . . our 
neighbors  can  even  copy  and  adopt”?  Because,  Kerckhoffs  said,  “it  is  not 
necessary  to  conjure  up  imaginary  phantoms  and  to  suspect  the  incorrupt- 
ibility of  employees  or  subalterns  to  understand  that,  if  a system  requiring 
secrecy  were  in  the  hands  of  too  large  a number  of  individuals,  it  could  be 
compromised  at  each  engagement  in  which  one  or  another  of  them  took 
part.”  This  has  proved  to  be  true,  and  Kerckhoffs’  second  requirement  has 
become  widely  accepted  under  a form  that  is  sometimes  called  the  funda- 
mental assumption  of  military  cryptography:  that  the  enemy  knows  the 
general  system.  But  he  must  still  be  unable  to  solve  messages  in  it  without 


236 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


knowing  the  specific  key.  In  its  modern  formulation,  the  Kerckhoffs  doctrine 
states  that  secrecy  must  reside  solely  in  the  keys. 

Had  Kerckhoffs  merely  published  his  perceptions  of  the  problems  facing 
post-telegraph  cryptography  and  his  prescriptions  for  resolving  them,  he 
would  have  assured  a place  for  himself  in  the  pantheon  of  cryptology.  But 
he  did  more.  He  contributed  two  techniques  of  cryptanalysis  that,  while  not 
as  wrenching  to  the  science  as  Kasiski’s,  play  roles  of  supreme  importance 
in  most  modern  solutions. 

The  first  of  these  is  superimposition.  It  constitutes  the  most  general 
solution  for  polyalphabetic  substitution  systems.  With  few  exceptions,  it  lays 
no  restrictions  on  the  type  or  length  of  keys,  as  does  the  Kasiski  method,  nor 
on  the  alphabets,  which  may  be  interrelated  or  entirely  independent.  It 
wants  only  several  messages  in  the  same  key.  The  cryptanalyst  must  align 
these  one  above  the  other  so  that  letters  enciphered  with  the  same  keyletter 
will  fall  into  a single  column.  In  the  simplest  case,  that  of  a running  key  that 
starts  over  again  with  each  message,  he  can  do  this  simply  by  placing  all  the 
first  letters  in  the  first  column,  all  the  second  letters  in  the  next  column,  and 
so  on. 

Kerckhoffs  demonstrated  this  procedure  with  1 3 short  messages  enciphered 
with  a long  key.  He  superimposed  his  first  five  cryptograms  like  this:

Now,  since  all  these  messages  were  enciphered  with  the  same  keytext, 
all  the  hidden  plaintext  letters  in  the  first  column  were  enciphered  by  the 
same  keyletter,  which  means  that  they  have  been  enciphered  in  the  same 
ciphertext  alphabet.  Consequently,  all  the  plaintext  as  will  have  the  same 
ciphertext  equivalent,  all  the  plaintext  b's  will  likewise  have  their  own  un- 
varying ciphertext  equivalent,  and  so  on.  Likewise,  each  ciphertext  letter 
represents  only  one  plaintext  letter.  This  holds  true  for  each  column.  Each 
column  may  thus  be  attacked  as  an  ordinary  mon alphabetic  substitution, 
just  like  the  columns  in  a periodic  polyalphabetic. 

In  cases  where  the  key  does  not  start  over  again  with  each  message,  the 
cryptanalyst  may  line  up  repetitions  in  several  messages  to  obtain  a proper 
superimposition. 

Superimposition  does  not  ask  that  the  alphabet  in  the  first  column  bear 
any  relation  to  that  in  the  second.  Thus  it  suits  cryptanalysts  of  such  systems 
as  that  of  C.  H.  C.  Krohn,  who  published  in  Berlin  in  1873  a dictionary  of 


237 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

3,200  alphabets  for  secret  correspondence ; Kerckhoffs  remarked  scornfully  of 
this  number  that  “it  is  at  once  too  many  and  too  few.”  But  superimposition 
does  depend  for  its  success  on  a sufficient  depth  of  column.  Kerckhoffs 
realized  this,  and  used  examples  to  show  that  if  two  columns  could  be  found 
to  have  been  enciphered  with  the  same  keyletter,  their  effective  depth  was 
doubled.  This  is  of  especially  great  value  with  coherent  running  keys,  whose 
cipher  alphabets  will  be  brought  into  play  with  the  irregular  frequency  that 
their  keyletters  have  in  plaintext.  If  all  the  columns  enciphered  with  the  cipher 
alphabet  governed  by  keyletter  E can  be  recognized,  collected,  and  solved 
together,  about  12  per  cent  of  the  plaintext  (in  an  English  running  key)  will 
be  recovered.  Identically  enciphered  columns  could  be  recognized,  Kerck- 
hoffs suggested,  by  finding  columns  with  similar  frequency  counts. 

Kerckhoffs  also  discerned  another  way  to  extort  more  plaintext  from  a 
paucity  of  ciphertext.  Unlike  most  techniques  of  cryptanalysis,  which  ascer- 
tain plaintext,  this  technique  determines  ciphertext  letters — which  are,  to  be 
sure,  immediately  converted  into  plaintext.  It  may  therefore  be  considered 
an  indirect  technique,  but  it  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  in  the  cryptanalyst’s 
arsenal.  Kerckhoffs  called  it  “symmetry  of  position.” 

How  it  works  may  be  seen  by  looking  at  part  of  a tableau  with  mixed 
alphabets: 

plain  abcdef  ghij  kl  mnopqrst  uvwxyz 

NEWYORKCI  TABDFGHJ  LMPQSUVXZ 
EWYORKCI  TABDFGHJ  LMPQSUVXZN 
cipher  wyorkci  tabdfghj  lmpqsuvxzne 
YORKCI  TABDFGHJ  LMPQSUVXZNEW 


Now,  it  is  evident  that  n and  e stand  next  to  one  another  in  every  cipher 
alphabet  of  this  tableau  (considering  the  alphabets  as  cyclical).  Similarly,  n 
is  separated  from  y by  an  interval  of  3 in  every  cipher  alphabet.  Again,  r 
stands  6 spaces,  or  cells,  before  b in  every  cipher  alphabet.  Relations  like 
these  may  be  fixed  between  any  two  (or  more)  ciphertext  letters,  and  they  will 
hold  for  every  cipher  alphabet  in  the  tableau.  So  if  the  cryptanalyst  deter- 
mines the  linear  distance  between  two  ciphertext  letters  in  one  alphabet,  and 
then  determines  one  of  those  letters  in  another  alphabet,  he  can  place  the 
second  letter  in  the  second  alphabet  at  the  known  distance.  This  contributes  a 
ciphertext  equivalent  which  he  did  not  have  before  and  which  he  can  decipher 
throughout  the  cryptogram  to  add  a few  grains  of  plaintext  to  further  his 
solution. 

For  example,  suppose  that  the  cryptanalyst  has  ascertained,  in  solving  a 
message  based  on  the  above  tableau,  that  k and  h represent  plaintext  e and  n. 
Consequently,  k and  h will  stand  9 places  apart  in  the  ciphertext  alphabet: 


238 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


plain  abcdefghi  j k lmnopqrstuvwxyz 

cipher  alphabet  Ik  h 

distance  0123456789 

Then  suppose  that,  in  another  alphabet,  he  has  discovered  that  ciphertext  k 
represents  plaintext  /'.  He  may  immediately  count  9 spaces  beyond  k,  thus: 

plain  abcdefghi  jk  1 mnopqrs  t uvwxyz 

cipher  alphabet  II  k 

distance  0123456789 

and  insert  a ciphertext  h at  that  point.  He  may  now  decipher  all  the  ciphertext 
h’s  in  alphabet  II  into  plaintext  r's.  If  he  finds  that,  say,  plaintext  e is  enciphered 
in  this  alphabet  by  w,  he  will  measure  the  distance  between  k and  w (four 
spaces  forward),  and  will  insert  a w four  spaces  before  K in  the  first  cipher- 
text  alphabet,  giving  him  the  identity  of  plaintext  b in  that  alphabet.  Since  the 
intervals  between  the  letters  remain  fixed  for  all  the  cipher  alphabets  of  this 
tableau,  the  proper  identification  of  a few  letters  in  a few  alphabets  can  lead 
to  the  determination  of  many  others. 

Kerckhoffs  went  no  further  than  this — a patent  symmetry  of  position. 
Cryptanalysts  see  it  when  they  build  up  skeleton  tableaux  in  solving  poly- 
alphab£tics  with  a normal  a-to-z  plaintext  alphabet.  But  modern  cryptolo- 
gists  have  discovered  that  skeleton  tableaux  for  polyalphabetics  with  mixed 
plaintext  alphabets  will  manifest  a latent  symmetry  of  position.  It  enlarges  the 
principle  of  linear  distances  to  include  horizontal  and  vertical  proportions. 
It  is  a complicated  technique,  but  an  enormously  valuable  one.  Sometimes  a 
chain  reaction  of  placements  will  reconstitute  an  entire  tableau.  More  often, 
it  will  donate  important  ciphertext  equivalents  to  the  cryptanalyst,  or  will 
notify  him  that  a certain  assumption  contradicts  its  rules  and  hence  is  un- 
tenable. Because  of  today’s  extensive  use  of  polyalphabetics  with  both 
alphabets  mixed,  latent  symmetry  of  position  is  an  indispensable  tool  of  the 
modern  cryptanalyst. 

Finally,  Kerckhoffs  rounded  out  his  work  by  popularizing  and  naming  the 
cryptographic  slide,  and  demonstrating  its  identity  with  the  polyalphabetic 
tableau.  He  called  the  slide  the  St.-Cyr  system,  after  the  French  national 
military  academy  where  it  was  taught.  A St.-Cyr  slide  consists  of  a long  piece 
of  paper  or  cardboard,  called  the  stator,  with  an  evenly  spaced  alphabet 
printed  on  it  and  with  two  slits  cut  below  and  to  the  sides  of  the  alphabet. 
Through  these  slits  runs  a long  strip  of  paper— the  slide  proper — on  which  an 
alphabet  is  printed  twice. 

If  both  alphabets  are  normal,  the  device  comprises  a shorthand  version  of 
the  Vigenere  tableau,  for  any  given  alphabet  of  that  tableau  may  be  repro- 
duced by  finding  its  keyletter  in  the  slide  alphabet  and  setting  this  under  the 
A of  the  stator.  The  stator  alphabet  will  represent  the  plaintext  alphabet  and 
the  slide  alphabet  the  cipher  alphabet.  The  alphabets  do  not  have  to  be  normal ; 


239 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

if  they  are  mixed,  the  slide  (a  term  that  sometimes  encompasses  the  entire 
device)  will  represent  a tableau  with  mixed  alphabets.  Any  slide  may  be 
expanded  into  a tableau,  and  any  tableau  that  is  derived  from  the  regular 
interaction  of  two  alphabets,  or  components,  may  be  compressed  into  the 
more  convenient  St.-Cyr  form.  Kerckhoffs  also  pointed  out  that  a cipher 
disk  was  merely  a St.-Cyr  slide  turned  round  to  bite  its  tail,  and  he  iterated 
Porta’s  observation  that  a cipher  disk  could  be  developed  into  an  equivalent 
tableau.  He  thus  joined  the  tableau,  the  cipher  disk,  and  the  St.-Cyr  slide  into 
a family  of  related  devices  that  differed  only  in  form. 

Such  are  the  many  excellences  of  La  Cryptographie  militaire.  It  stands 
perhaps  first  among  the  great  books  of  cryptology.  Its  incisiveness,  its  clarity, 
its  solid  base  of  scholarly  research,  its  invaluable  new  techniques,  but  above 
all  its  maturity,  its  wisdom,  and  its  vision,  elevate  it  to  that  rank.  Perhaps 
it  could  only  have  been  done  by  a man  as  well-rounded  and  as  sensitive  as 
Kerckhoffs. 

It  is  ironic  that  the  most  lasting  work  of  a man  whose  ideals  were  as  cosmo- 
politan as  Kerckhoffs’  should  have  had  nationalistic  results.  Yet  perhaps  the 
most  immediate  consequence  of  La  Cryptographie  militaire  was  its  giving 
France  a commanding  lead  in  cryptology,  accruing  benefits  that  were  cashed 
during  World  War  I.  The  Ministry  of  War  bought  300  copies.  Signal  officers 
and  amateur  cryptographers  read  it,  and,  in  reaction,  invented  or  reinvented 
systems  such  as  the  autokey  to  circumvent  the  powerful  superimposition 
technique.  A whole  literature  poured  off  the  presses.  France  flowered  in  a 
cryptologic  renaissance. 

Yet  the  French  interest  in  cryptology  was  not  due  purely  to  the  intellectual 
challenge  of  the  subject.  Much  of  the  impetus  must  have  come  from  the  smart 
of  France’s  1870  defeat  by  Prussia  and  her  desire  for  revenge — the  same 
desire  that  drove  her  to  build  up  the  largest  army  in  Europe.  It  is  significant 
that  while  almost  two  dozen  books  and  pamphlets  on  cryptology  were  pub- 
lished in  France  between  1883  and  1914,  to  say  nothing  of  scores  of  articles, 
only  half  a dozen  appeared  in  Germany,  all  third-rate  except  for  a few 
superb  historical  studies. 

Probably  several  factors  led  to  this  indifference.  The  1870  victory  may 
have  convinced  the  Germans  that  they  were  doing  things  right  and  did  not  need 
to  change.  Germans  tend  to  be  regimented  and  less  apt  to  suggest  new  ideas 
to  the  authorities  than  the  more  individualistic  French.  And  Germans  seem 
to  have  a predilection  for  working  things  out  in  advance  according  to  theory, 
for  erecting  elaborate  structures  based  on  pure  reason.  They  sought,  by  the 
clarity  of  their  logic  and  the  unshakability  of  their  assumptions,  to  do  in 
cryptography  what  they  did  in  philosophy — produce  the  ideal  system. 
Kerckhoffs  had  shown  that  this  approach  is  sterile,  if  not  actually  dangerous. 
But  the  Germans  persisted,  confident  of  the  superiority  of  anything  Teutonic. 
Their  writers  occupied  themselves  with  cryptography  to  the  virtual  neglect  of 


240  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

cryptanalysis.  The  French,  more  pragmatic,  submitted  their  ciphers  to  the 
harsh  judgment  of  actual  solution. 

The  course  of  French  prewar  cryptology  may  be  traced  in  its  literature. 
Most  of  the  books  were  second-rate,  unoriginal,  deriving  their  ideas  from 
Kerckhoffs,  whom  they  repeatedly  laud.  Typical  is  H.  Josse,  a captain  of 
artillery  who  is  chiefly  noted  for  condensing  Kerckhoffs’  six  desiderata  into 
a single  guiderule  that  apparently  governed  the  selection  of  French  field 
ciphers  up  to  World  War  I:  “Military  cryptography,  properly  called,  must 
employ  a system  requiring  only  pencil  and  paper.”  Josse  quoted  Kerckhoffs 
so  often  that  he  felt  it  necessary  to  insert  an  apologetic  “M.  Kerckhoffs,  whose 
name  recurs  so  often  in  cryptography”  after  an  especially  heavy  flurry  of 
references.  But  four  fine  writers  helped  make  French  cryptology  the  best  in 
the  world  at  the  time:  de  Viaris,  Valerio,  Delastelle,  and  Bazeries. 

The  Marquis  Gaetan  Henri  Leon  Viarizio  di  Lesegno,  whose  name  was 
gallicized  to  de  Viaris,  was  born  February  13,  1847,  at  Cherbourg.  His  father 
was  an  artillery  captain.  At  19,  young  de  Viaris  entered  the  famed  Ecole 
Polytechnique  as  48th — and  graduated  as  102nd  (out  of  134).  He  enlisted  in 
the  Navy  at  21,  earning  his  commission  as  ensign  two  years  later,  but  serving 
for  only  four  years  before  resigning  at  25.  He  later  became  an  assistant  police 
prefect  and  an  infantry  officer. 

He  apparently  became  interested  in  cryptology  about  the  mid- 1880s.  He 
devised  some  of  the  first  cipher  machines  to  integrate  a printing  mechanism:* 
after  enciphering,  the  cryptographer  pressed  a button  which  imprinted  the 
cipher  letter  on  a paper  tape.  He  published  for  the  first  time  in  cryptology 
what  he  called  “cryptographic  equations.”  (Babbage  had  employed  such 
equations  in  his  own  work,  but  had  never  described  them  publicly.) 

In  articles  in  the  scientific  journal  Le  Genie  Civil  for  May  12  and  19,  1888 
(the  first  two  parts  of  a series  that  was  later  collected  into  a book),  de  Viaris 
proposed  that  the  Greek  letter  chi  (y)  stand  for  any  ciphertext  letter,  gamma 
(7)  for  any  keyletter  and  the  lower-case  c for  any  cleartext  letter.  He  then 
proved  that  the  algebraic  formula  c + y = x would  produce  a Vigenere  en- 
cipherment no  different  from  the  standard  manipulations  of  tableau,  slide, 
or  disk.  If  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  be  numbered  from  zero  to  25, 

a bcdefghij  klmnopqrstuvwxyz 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25 

the  Vigenere  may  be  duplicated  mathematically  by  adding  the  values  for 
plain  and  key  together  and  then  turning  the  sum  (less  26  if  it  is  26  or  above) 
back  into  letter  form.  For  example,  a standard  tableau  encipherment  of 
plaintext  d with  key  G yields  cipher  j.  With  the  formula,  these  same  letters 
give  3+6  = 9,  or  j.  A different  cipher  will  naturally  have  a different  formula. 

* The  earliest  known  printing  cipher  machine  appears  to  be  one  invented  before  1874  by 
£mile  Vinay  and  Joseph  Gaussin,  but  no  description  of  it  is  known.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Those  for  the  Big  Three  of  normal-alphabet  polyalphabetics  are  (using  the 
modern  notation  of  p for  plain,  k for  key  and  c for  cipher): 


enciphering 

deciphering 

Vigenere 

P + K = c 

C-K  = P 

Variant 

P-K  = c 

C + K = P 

Beaufort 

K-  P = c 

K-C  = P 

The  symmetry  of  these  formulas  clearly  shows  almost  graphically  that 
Beaufort  is  a reciprocal  substitution  and  that  Variant  and  Vigenere  are  in- 
verse operations.  It  is  a striking  demonstration  of  how  mathematics  flood- 
lights the  architecture  of  ciphers,  revealing  their  framework  in  a glare  of 
illumination. 

Mathematics  was  just  de  Viaris’  bright  idea  in  the  1880s.  Nobody  paid 
much  attention  to  his  formulas,  and  even  he  did  not  pursue  the  matter.  But 
they  testify  to  his  originality.  In  1893,  he  published  another  book  that,  like 
Kerckhoffs’,  stressed  the  cryptanalytic.  It  included  a fine  solution  of  a 
difficult  cipher  proposed  by  a fellow  cryptologist.  During  this  time  he  had 
reorganized  the  Bureau  du  Chiffre  of  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  insti- 
tuting a new  method  of  communication — probably  his  Dictionnaire  ABC , 
published  in  1898,  which  used  a flexible  band  with  numbers  printed  on  it  to 
facilitate  superencipherment.  De  Viaris  died  on  February  18,  1901. 

The  work  of  Paul  Louis  Eugene  Valerio,  a captain  of  artillery,  began 
appearing  in  the  Journal  des  Sciences  militaires  in  December,  1892,  almost 
exactly  ten  years  after  Kerckhoffs’  first  article.  But  where  Kerckhoffs  was 
concise,  Valerio  was  exhaustive.  The  last  of  ten  installments  was  not  published 
until  May  of  1895,  by  which  time  the  work  totaled  214  pages.  More  than  two 
thirds  was  taken  up  by  an  exhaustive  study  of  the  phonological  characteristics 
of  the  main  European  languages;  Valerio,  who  felt  the  drift  of  the  times,  con- 
centrated heavily  on  German.  The  rest  of  the  work — later  assembled  into 
book  form  as  De  la  cryptographic — detailed  the  solutions  of  cipher  systems 
and,  for  perhaps  the  first  time  in  cryptology,  of  codes.  Except  for  his  exposi- 
tion on  code  cryptanalysis,  Valerio  added  little  that  was  new  to  the  science, 
but  his  comprehensiveness  filled  in  areas  merely  outlined  by  his  predecessors 
and  gave  French  cryptology  a feeling  of  completion  and  solidity  that  it  had 
lacked. 

Felix  Marie  Delastelle  was  the  only  major  writer  on  cryptology  of  the 
time  who  was  not  in  the  military.  He  was  born  January  2,  1840,  at  the 
Brittany  seaport  of  Saint-Malo  to  a long  line  of  seafaring  ancestors — his 
father,  master  of  an  oceangoing  vessel,  was  apparently  lost  at  sea  when  Felix 
was  three.  After  graduating  from  the  College  of  Saint-Malo,  Delastelle  got  a 
job  as  inspector  with  the  government’s  Tobacco  Administration,  with  duties 
involving  warehousing  in  cities  as  large  as  Marseilles,  a post  he  held  for  forty 
years.  After  his  retirement  in  1900,  the  quiet  bachelor  moved  into  Ker  Kador, 
an  apartment  hotel  in  Parame,  near  Saint-Malo,  where  he  devoted  full  time 


243 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

to  writing  a book  on  cryptology  that  would  improve  on  the  short  one  he  had 
written  seven  years  earlier.  He  signed  the  foreword  at  Parame  on  May  25, 

1901,  and  the  book,  Traite  Ele'mentaire  de  Cryptographic,  was  published  the 
following  year  by  the  respected  house  of  Gauthier-Villars.  But  on  April  2, 

1902,  while  he  was  about  to  go  to  the  home  of  his  elder  brother,  Auguste 
Michel,  who  had  just  died,  he  was  stricken  with  a heart  attack,  and  died  the 
same  day. 

His  book’s  156  pages  deal  mostly  with  systems  of  encipherment.  Delastelle 
accused  most  previous  books  with  considerable  justice  of  being  “only  cata- 
logues, more  or  less  complete  and  detailed,  of  various  systems,  of  which  none 
is  studied  in  depth,  even  several  that  differ  only  in  appearance.  I therefore 
believe,”  he  wrote  in  his  foreword,  “that  I have  done  something  useful  in 
classifying  all  these  systems  and  in  discussing  how  principles  may  be  deduced 
from  them.” 

But  while  the  individuality  of  cipher  systems  balked  this  plan,  Delastelle's 
good  intentions  rewarded  him.  While  searching  for  a method  of  bigraphic 
encipherment  that  did  not  require  cumbersome  26-by-26  enciphering  tables 
(during  which  he  reasoned  his  way  to  an  independent  invention  of  the  Play- 
fair), Delastelle  invented  a fractionating  system  of  considerable  importance  in 
cryptology.  It  differed  from  those  of  Pliny  Earle  Chase,  who  had  subjected  the 
letter  fractions  to  substitution  before  recombining  them.  Delastelle  transposed 
them.  His  cipher,  the  bifid,  requires  the  fundamental  bipartite  substitution, 
which  he  somehow  never  wrote  in  checkerboard  form: 

abcdefghijklm 
42  22  14  32  34  25  11  53  51  41  15  23  54 

nopqrs  tuvxyz 
12  55  33  31  52  21  35  13  24  44  43  45 

The  plaintext  is  written  in  groups  of  a specified  length,  say  five  letters,  and  the 
coordinates  are  written  vertically  beneath  each  letter.  Delastelle  set  up  his 
own  plaintext,  Attendez  des  ordres  (“Wait  for  orders”),  like  this: 

atten  dezde  sordr  es 

43331  33433  25535  32 

25542  24524  15222  41 

To  form  the  ciphertext,  the  coordinates  are  paired  horizontally  group  by 
group  and  reconverted  into  letters:  43  = y,  33  = p,  12  = n,  55  = o,  and  so 
on.  The  complete  ciphertext:  ypnoa  pydzv  fhirb  dj.  If  a different  alphabet 
serves  for  the  recomposition,  the  system  is  called  a bifid  with  conjugated 
matrices.  If  tripartite  coordinates  (a  — 111,  b = 112,  c = 113,  etc.)  are  de- 
composed, the  elements  shuffled  and  then  recomposed  in  different  combina- 
tions, the  system  is  called  a trifid. 

Delastelle  experimented  to  nullify  Kerckhoffs’  symmetry  of  position  by 
shifting  the  positions  of  key,  plain,  cipher,  and  index  letters  in  St.-Cyr  slides. 


244 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  traditional  arrangement  regards  the  first  letter  of  the  stator  alphabet  as 
the  index  letter ; the  key  is  set  under  this ; the  plaintext  is  then  located  in  the 
stator  alphabet  and  the  ciphertext  on  the  slide  beneath  it.  Delastelle  burst  the 
bonds  and  showed  that  other  dispositions  would  serve  as  well.  For  example, 
the  keyletter  may  be  located  in  the  stator  alphabet  and  the  plaintext  set  under 
it;  then  the  letter  designated  as  the  index  letter  may  be  located  on  the  slide 
and  the  ciphertext  found  on  the  stator  above  it.  Because  Delastelle  did  not 
move  the  index  letter,  he  found  only  eight  such  dispositions.  But  there  are 
actually  twelve,  and,  despite  Delastelle’s  attempt,  all  show  some  kind  of 
symmetry,  whether  latent  or  patent,  vertical  or  horizontal,  in  the  plain  or  in 
the  cipher  component. 

Etienne  Bazeries  is  the  great  pragmatist  of  cryptology.  His  theoretical 
contributions  are  negligible,  but  he  was  one  of  the  greatest  natural  crypt- 
analysts the  science  has  seen.  Ciphers  melted  under  the  fierce  intensity  of  his 
mental  processes.  Historical  cryptograms,  new  inventions,  official  systems, 
the  clandestine  communications  of  plotters — all  receded,  abandoned  their 
ramparts,  and  finally  succumbed  to  his  blazing  onslaught.  He  was  also  the 
most  opinionated  cryptanalyst  the  science  has  known.  His  barbed  pronuncia- 
mentos,  hurled  like  Jovian  thunderbolts,  enraged  his  contemporaries  and 
lashed  the  usually  unruffled  waters  of  cryptology  into  unwonted  tempests. 

He  was  born  August  21,  1846,  the  son  of  a mounted  policeman,  in  the 
little  Mediterranean  fishing  village  of  Port-Vendres,  which  lies  in  the  shadow 
of  the  mighty  Pyrenees.  Raised  there,  Etienne  learned  Catalan  at  the  same 
time  he  learned  French.  Five  days  after  he  turned  seventeen,  he  enlisted  in 
the  Army’s  4th  Supply  Squadron  to  avoid  the  agricultural  career  his  family 
had  planned  for  him.  He  fought  in  the  Franco-Prussian  War  and  was  taken 
prisoner  of  war  when  Metz  fell,  but  escaped,  disguised  as  a bricklayer.  Promo- 
tions came  slowly  but  steadily,  despite  a strong-willed  individualism  that 
refused  to  accept  things  as  they  are  simply  because  they  are:  as  a lieutenant, 
he  nervily  told  a general  that  the  regimental  harness  injured  the  squadron's 
horses.  He  had  been  given  his  lieutenancy  in  1874,  and  the  next  year  was  sent 
to  Algeria  on  the  first  of  three  tours  of  duty  there.  On  his  return  in  1876,  he 
married  Marie-Louise-Elodie  Berthon,  by  whom  he  had  three  daughters. 

He  seems  to  have  become  interested  in  cryptology  by  solving  the  crypto- 
grams in  the  newspapers’  personal  columns,  some  of  them  setting  up  adulter- 
ous assignations,  with  whose  sordid  details  he  regaled  his  messmates.  One 
day  in  1890,  while  stationed  at  Nantes,  he  said  aloud  to  his  brother  officers  at 
the  headquarters  of  the  1 1th  Corps  that  the  official  French  military  cipher,  a 
complicated  form  of  transposition,  could  be  read  without  the  key.  There  was 
a general  roar  of  laughter — but  one  who  did  not  join  the  chorus  was  the  corps 
commander,  General  Charles  Alexandre  Fay,  one  of  the  best-known  officers 
of  the  time.  He  took  Bazeries  up  on  the  implied  challenge  and  sent  him  several 
cryptograms  in  the  system.  Bazeries  solved  them;  his  comrades  and  Fay  were 


245 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil’s  Island 

impressed;  even  the  War  Ministry  took  note,  and  readied  a new  system.  Then 
Bazeries  topped  his  own  feat  by  reading  the  test  messages  in  the  new  system 
before  it  even  went  into  service. 

Word  of  his  ability  had  evidently  spread  beyond  the  parade  ground,  for 
early  the  next  year  a gentleman  from  Nantes,  one  Bord,  who  had  invented  a 
printing  cryptograph  that,  Bazeries  conceded,  was  “a  jewel  of  an  instrument,” 
submitted  eight  cryptograms  enciphered  with  it  to  Bazeries.  This  was  on 
January  8,  1891;  by  the  31st,  Bord,  attempting  to  salvage  the  system,  was 
sending  him  five  messages  in  a more  complicated  arrangement  of  the  device. 
Bazeries  read  two  more  sets,  of  increasing  complication  if  not  difficulty,  until, 
wanting  to  halt  what  had  become  for  him  a tedious  repetition,  he  had  Bord 
compose  one  in  his  ultimate  system.  Bazeries  easily  discovered  that  it  read,  “I 
want  to  be  hanged  if  you  decipher  this,”  hastily  implored  the  inventor  not  to 
do  anything  rash,  and  observed  later  that  if  all  those  whose  ciphers  had  been 
solved  were  to  be  hanged,  the  penalty  would  lose  all  meaning. 

By  now  his  reputation  had  reached  the  Quai  d’Orsay  in  Paris,  for  in 
August  of  1891  the  Army  placed  him  temporarily  at  the  disposition  of  the 
Bureau  du  Chiffre  of  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs.  He  was  promoted  in 
1892  to  the  command  of  his  own  supply  squadron,  and  served  again  with  the 
Foreign  Ministry  in  1894. 

These  years  in  and  around  Paris  were  his  most  active,  cryptologically.  As 
fast  as  new  ciphers  appeared,  he  smashed  them.  Among  those  he  solved  were 
the  systems  of  La  Feuillade,  Hermann,  and  d’Ocagne,  and  the  devices  of 
Gavrelle  and  de  Viaris — the  latter  feat  one  that  was  soon  to  boomerang.  He 
became  interested  in  historical  ciphers  when  a commandant  on  the  general 
staff  asked  him  for  help  in  reading  some  ciphered  dispatches  for  a study  of 
Louis  XIV’s  military  campaigns.  Bazeries  solved  that  system,  and  then  rifled 
the  archives  for  others,  succeeding  in  breaking  down  nomenclators  of  Francis 
I,  Francis  II,  Henry  IV,  Mirabeau,  and  Napoleon.  He  found  the  campaign 
ciphers  of  the  great  military  genius  so  feeble  that  he  contemptuously  put  the 
word  “ciphers”  in  quotation  marks  in  the  title  of  his  monograph  on  them. 

He  bloodied  his  knuckles  in  the  arena  of  real-life  cryptanalysis,  too.  In 
1892,  French  authorities  arrested  a group  of  anarchists  and  brought  them  to 
trial.  Included  in  the  evidence  was  a number  of  cryptograms  that  had  been 
solved  by  Bazeries.  They  used  a system  called  the  Gronsfeld,  a kind  of  trunc- 
ated Vigenere  named  for  the  Count  of  Gronsfeld,  who  described  it  to  the 
17th-century  author  Gaspar  Schott  while  they  went  together  from  Mainz  to 
Frankfort.  Its  key  consists  of  numbers,  each  of  which  indicates  the  number 
of  letters  forward  in  the  normal  alphabet  that  the  encipherer  is  to  count  from 
the  plaintext  letter  to  the  ciphertext  letter.  For  example,  with  the  anarchist 
key  of  456327,  the  first  word  of  the  message  of  April  30,  Demande,  would  be 
enciphered  to  hjsdpki  in  this  manner:  counting  four  letters  beyond  d gives 
e,  f,  g,  h — and  h is  the  ciphertext  letter;  five  letters  beyond  e stands  j,  and  so 
on.  Bazeries  was  not  up  to  his  usual  standard  here,  however : the  mere  use  of  six 


246 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


nulls  at  the  head  and  the  tail  of  the  cryptograms  incomprehensibly  delayed 
his  solution  for  an  entire  fortnight.  For  some  reason,  he  always  considered 
this  solution,  which  should  have  been  his  least  distinguished,  as  his 
best. 

After  he  retired  from  the  Army  in  1899,  the  Foreign  Ministry  hired  him 
as  a cryptanalyst.  He  worked  partly  at  home,  partly  in  the  office,  living  much 
of  the  time  at  Versailles.  That  same  year,  the  ministry  recommended  him  to 
the  police  as  the  man  who  might  solve  a series  of  dispatches  captured,  with 
a numerical  Beaufort  table,  in  the  quarters  of  one  Chevilly,  a supporter  of 
the  Duke  of  Orleans,  pretender  to  the  throne  of  France.  The  messages 
consisted  of  groups  of  four  digits,  none  of  which  was  smaller  than  1111  or 
larger  than  3737.  This  indicated  to  Bazeries  that  each  pair  of  numbers  stood 
for  a letter,  11  representing  a;  12,  b;  and  so  on  up  to  36  for  z and  37  again 
for  a.  He  was  put  off  for  a good  while  by  that  rare  but  extraordinarily 
bewildering  cryptologic  mischance:  long  repetitions  in  a polyalphabetic 
cryptogram  that  result  purely  from  chance  and  not,  as  Bazeries  long  thought, 
from  the  interaction  of  a periodic  key  with  a repeated  plaintext.  For  example, 
in  a telegram  of  February  1 7,  1 898,  the  digits  30  24  14  12  repeated  at  a distance 
of  21,  indicating  a period  of  3 or  of  7;  when  the  cryptogram  was  solved,  the 
first  repetition  proved  to  be  the  plaintext  lesd  enciphered  by  erve,  and  the 
second  plaintext  prou  with  key  ierv.  In  another  telegram,  a false  trigraphic 
repetition  indicated  a period  of  8.  Bazeries  eventually  broke  the  messages 
down  by  a series  of  inspired  guesses  as  to  probable  words,  and  found  them 
to  fall  into  two  sets,  one  enciphered  with  successive  lines  of  the  famous  poem 
Nuit  de  decembre  by  Alfred  de  Musset,  the  other  with  the  day  and  date  on 
which  the  message  was  sent.  Each  message  thus  had  its  own  key,  which  would 
have  made  it  necessary  for  each  to  be  attacked  individually — except  that 
Bazeries,  after  solving  a few,  deduced  the  key  to  the  keys. 

Thus  he  had  the  satisfaction  of  solving  a message  that  could  not  be  de- 
ciphered by  the  duke  because  it  was  loaded  with  errors — and  of  reading  the 
duke’s  short  and  pointed  reply.  The  duke’s  dispatch — 3733  3737  1514  1224 
2920  2524 — was  sent  at  9:35  a.m.  on  Tuesday,  December  13,  1898,  after  a 
long  and  fruitless  night  of  trying  to  decipher  the  incoming  message.  Bazeries 
translated  it  with  the  key  MARDI  TRE1ZE  D[ECEMBRE]  and  discovered 
one  of  the  most  heartfelt  expressions  of  disgust  ever  vented  by  a cipherer  who 
has  received  a garbled  wire.  Seven  null  q's  gave  the  message  bulk,  but  the 
meaningful  portion  was  monosyllabic:  Merde.  “The  word,”  the  cryptanalyst 
remarked  with  uncharacteristic  understatement,  “is  vigorous.”  Bazeries  later 
testified  to  these  solutions  at  the  trial  of  the  conspirators  in  the  High  Court  of 
Justice. 

In  1913,  Bazeries  bought  a house  in  Ceret,  a small  town  not  far  from  his 
birthplace,  in  search  of  health  for  one  of  his  daughters.  Neighbors  did  not 
know  that  the  bearded,  gray-haired  gentleman  with  the  wide  forehead  and  the 
piercing  gaze  was  known  as  the  Lynx  of  the  Quai  d’Orsay,  the  Napoleon  of

The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

Ciphers,  the  Magician.  They  seldom  saw  him,  for  he  came  down  from 
Versailles  only  when  he  had  a major  solution  to  prepare,  and  then  he  shut 
himself  up  in  his  house  on  the  Place  des  Neuf  Jets,  where  he  would  hire  only 
illiterate  servants,  and,  fortified  with  his  pipes  and  pots  of  coffee,  assailed  the 
cryptograms  that  the  Foreign  Ministry  sent  down  from  Paris.  Only  when 
exhausted  by  a long  bout  would  he  emerge  and  head  for  a day  of  picnicking 
in  the  nearby  mountains.  His  wife  and  three  daughters,  Cesarine,  Fernande, 
and  Paule,  dressed  in  the  long,  rustling  skirts  that  were  then  the  height  of 
fashion,  trailed  their  cane-swinging  father  through  the  village  to  an  upland 
farm,  where  he  would  interrogate  the  farmers  in  Catalan  and  try  to  convince 
his  daughters  to  like  the  local  Roussillon  wine  that  his  wife  could  not  stand. 
When  World  War  I came,  he  assisted  in  solving  German  military  crypto- 
grams. He  did  not  retire  until  1924,  when  he  was  78.  He  died  at  Noyon  on 
November  7,  1931,  aged  85. 

But  if  he  was  continually  successful  in  cryptanalysis,  he  was  continually 
rebuffed  in  his  years-long  cryptographic  battle  to  have  the  military  establish- 
ment adopt  the  ciphers  he  proposed  instead  of  the  official  ones  which,  he  said, 
“offer  little  resistance  to  solution.”  He  had  little  trouble  in  demonstrating  their 
frangibility:  in  addition  to  the  Nantes  solutions,  he  was  given  a test  crypto- 
gram in  the  army  cipher  by  a general  of  artillery  during  one  of  his  Algerian 
tours,  and  he  solved  it  during  a 250-mile  train  ride  from  Constantine  to 
Philippeville.  But,  as  he  himself  said,  “to  prove  that  a cipher  that  is  being  used 
is  worthless  is  one  thing,  but  it  is  another  to  propose  something  better  in  its 
place.” 

His  disdain  for  the  official  ciphers  stung  him  into  firing  off  two  poly- 
alphabetic systems  of  his  own,  both  of  which  the  general  staff  rejected  on  the 
ground  that  they  were  too  complicated.  A friendly  officer  at  Nantes — perhaps 
General  Fay — then  suggested  that  he  might  have  greater  success  if  he  devised 
an  apparatus  that  a cipher  clerk  could  use  “without  knocking  his  brains  out.” 
Bazeries  reworked  one  of  his  systems,  which  employed  20  different  cipher 
alphabets,  and  came  up  with  his  “cylindrical  cryptograph.”  It  was  practically 
the  same  as  Jefferson’s  wheel  cypher,  except  that  it  had  20  disks  with  25  letters 
on  their  circumferences  instead  of  36  disks  with  a full  alphabet.  He  offered  it 
to  the  Ministry  of  War  on  February  12,  1891,  backed  by  a recommendation 
from  Fay,  and  described  it  on  September  19  of  that  same  year  at  a convention 
of  the  French  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Sciences  in  Marseilles. 
The  Army  turned  it  down  as  too  complicated.  Bazeries  simplified  it,  and 
resubmitted  it  at  a meeting  of  the  Military  Cryptography  Commission  on 
February  9,  1893.  Present,  Bazeries  relates,  was  the  captain  who  had  invented 
the  system  then  in  use,  which  Bazeries  had  solved.  “We  knew,”  Bazeries 
wrote  later,  “that,  as  a foregone  conclusion,  he  would  be  hostile  to  all 
inventors  of  cryptologic  systems.”  In  fact  the  Bazeries  cylinder — as  it  is 
commonly  called — was  not  adopted,  but  the  Marquis  de  Viaris,  perhaps 
piqued  by  Bazeries’  shattering  of  his  cipher  device,  exerted  himself  to  solve  a 


248  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

series  of  three  messages  sent  him  by  Bazeries  and  thus  rationalized  the  Army  's 
decision. 

His  method  requires  possession  of  the  device.  This  presupposition  was 
quite  in  line  with  Kerckhoffs’  principle  that  no  military  system  should 
require  the  secrecy  of  the  apparatus.  Bazeries  accepted  the  principle  and 
contended  that  the  key  alone — the  order  in  which  the  disks  are  placed  on  the 
spindle — assured  the  absolute  unsolvability  of  the  system.  In  the  de  Viaris 
method,  the  cryptanalyst  begins  by  turning  the  disks  so  that  only  a's  stand 
on  the  “plaintext”  line.  Each  successive  line — called  a “generatrix” — com- 
prises all  the  ciphertext  equivalents  for  a that  could  possibly  exist  on  that 
generatrix.  Furthermore,  the  array  of  equivalents  on  each  generatrix  differs

Etienne  Bazeries ’ drawing  of  his  cylinder,  with  plaintext  “/  am  indecipherable ” 


from  the  array  on  any  other  generatrix.  For  example,  the  first  two  genera- 
trices under  a in  the  orginal  Bazeries  device  were: 

disk  number  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20 

plaintext  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
generatrix  l beezzzlvrfni  utj  i bbcc 
generatrix  2 c i byxxodyndcxibmcchf 

The  patterning  results  from  the  peculiar  way  in  which  Bazeries  constructed 
his  alphabets  to  make  them  mnemonic.  Some  consisted  of  intercalations  of 
vowels  and  consonants ; others  derived  from  keyphrases  tending  toward  the 
patriotic  (“God  protects  France,”  “Honor  and  country”),  the  homiletic 
(“Avoid  drafts,”  “Instruct  youth”),  and  the  idiotic  (“I  like  onion  fried  in  oil”). 
Other  alphabets  would  produce  other  patterns. 

Now,  these  first  two  generatrices  employ  distinctive  sets  of  letters  as  the 
substitutes  for  a :

in  generatrix  1 b c E f ijln  stuv  z 

in  generatrix  2 BCD  F G I mno  xy 

The  cryptanalyst  now  assumes  that  a probable  word  or  word-fragment  such 
as  -ation  has  been  enciphered  wholly  on  one  generatrix  in  the  cryptogram 


249 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

before  him.  He  then  lists  all  the  possible  first-generatrix  substitutes  for  a,  for  t, 
for  i,  o,  and  n in  columns  next  to  one  another.  These  five  columns  he  slides 
along  under  the  cryptogram  looking  for  a five-letter  group  whose  first  letter 
appears  among  the  substitutes  for  a,  whose  second  appears  among  the  sub- 
stitutes for  t,  and  so  on.  Any  such  group  obviously  constitutes  a possible  first- 
generatrix  substitute  for  -ation. 

Suppose  the  cryptanalyst  finds  such  a group.  If  the  substitute  for  a in  that 
group  is  v,  the  disk  in  use  at  that  point  must  have  been  number  8.  It  is  the 
only  disk  which  substitutes  v for  a on  the  first  generatrix.  If  the  substitute 
were  z,  the  disk  in  use  must  have  been  either  4,  5,  or  6.  The  choices  for  the 
other  letters  will  be  similarly  limited.  The  cryptanalyst  then  assembles  a trial 
grouping  of  disks  based  on  these  choices,  and,  because  the  message  was 
enciphered  20  letters  at  a time,  makes  trial  decipherments  at  intervals  of  20 
letters.  If  little  atolls  of  plaintext  break  the  surface  of  the  ciphertext  sea,  he 
obviously  has  found  the  right  permutation  of  some  of  the  disks.  He  can 
anagram  to  enlarge  the  islets  into  an  archipelago,  and  to  eventually  merge 
them  into  an  entire  continent  of  clear.  If  no  solid  plaintext  emerges,  the 
cryptanalyst  must  move  his  list  along  under  the  cryptogram  until  another 
possibility  appears.  If  none  appears  with  the  equivalents  from  the  first 
generatrix,  the  cryptanalyst  must  try  with  those  of  the  second,  and  so  on. 
The  whole  process,  de  Viaris  said,  takes  longer  to  explain  than  to  carry  out. 

Despite  this  truly  fine  bit  of  cryptanalysis,  Bazeries  would  not  concede 
that  de  Viaris  had  done  what  he  had  in  fact  done:  found  a valid  solution  for 
the  Bazeries  cylinder.  The  inventor  pointed  out  that  the  cryptogram  presented 
in  Marseilles  remained  unsolved,  insisted  that  it  never  would  be  solved,  re- 
affirmed his  faith  in  his  brainchild,  and,  in  the  words  of  a later  commentator, 
generally  displayed  “a  woeful  lack  of  that  intellectual  generosity  which  a 
scientist  must  invariably  display  towards  an  antagonist  when  facing  the 
collapse  of  his  theory,  even  if  a cherished  one.” 

Notwithstanding  de  Viaris’  solution  or  Bazeries’  inordinate  faith,  the 
system  of  simultaneous  encipherment  with  multiple  alphabets  is  a good  one, 
and,  with  frequent  key  changes  and  some  modifications,  can  serve  as  a quite 
effective  military  cipher.  Though  he  probably  never  knew  it,  Bazeries  was 
vindicated  during  his  own  lifetime  when,  in  1922,  the  U.S.  Army  adopted  his 
system. 

The  rejection  of  his  cylinder  hardly  stilled  Bazeries’  fear  that  weak 
military  ciphers  imperiled  his  country.  His  fervent  patriotism,  his  refusal  to 
submit  meekly  to  mere  authority,  his  legitimate  conviction  that  his  crypt- 
analytic  accomplishments  qualified  him  to  judge  the  merits  of  a cipher,  all 
impelled  him  to  put  forward  one  final  system.  It  conformed  to  the  general 
staff  requirement — possibly  taken  from  Josse’s  dictum — that  it  need  only 
pencil  and  paper  for  its  operation. 

Basically,  it  consisted  of  a monalphabetic  substitution  that  changed  with 
each  message  combined  with  a transposition.  Each  message  carried  its  own 


250 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


key  at  the  head.  The  key  consisted  of  two  letters,  which  were  turned  into  a 
number  by  means  of  the  simple  rule  A = 1,  B = 2,  and  so  on,  and  this, 
written  out  as  a phrase,  formed  the  cipher  alphabet.  Using  English,  SF  be- 
comes 186,  or  ONE  HUNDRED  EIGHTY-SIX,  giving  a key  alphabet  of 
ONEHUDRIGTYSXABCFJKLMPQVWZ.  After  the  plaintext  was  sub- 
stituted by  means  of  this  alphabet,  it  was  divided  into  groups  of  three  letters 
and  these  groups  reversed.  Vowels  could  be  interpolated  as  nulls  before  each 
such  triplet ; if  such  a group  began  with  a ciphertext  vowel,  a null  had  neces- 
sarily to  be  inserted  before  it  to  prevent  confusion.  Bazeries  felt  that  the  change 
of  key  with  each  message  effectively  fortified  his  system,  and  he  offered  a 
sample  cryptogram.  Though  the  French  cryptanalysts  never  solved  it,  the 
Ministry  of  War  wrote  him  on  April  19,  1899,  that  “the  method  does  not 
present  sufficient  guarantees  of  security  to  be  adopted.” 

For  once  the  bureaucrats  were  right;  no  monoalphabetic  substitution  can 
maintain  security  in  heavy  traffic.  Bazeries,  naturally  enough,  remained  en- 
tirely unconvinced,  and  in  1901  he  revenged  himself  in  a bitter,  scornful, 
episodic  book  called  Les  Chiffres  Secrets  Devoiles  (“Secret  Ciphers  Unveiled”). 
“May  this  revelation  lead  the  War  Department  to  change  its  locks,”  he 
exclaims  in  the  introduction  of  a book  whose  cover  is  subtly  adorned  with  a 
photograph  of  the  Bazeries  cylinder.  He  flagellated  the  general  staff  for  its 
“willful  blindness”  in  matters  cryptologic,  rehearsed  his  tale  of  injured  pride, 
argued  anew  for  his  ciphers,  rebutted  the  official  criticism  of  them.  His  pages 
rasp:  “The  French  general  staff,  in  adopting  these  methods,  believed  it  made 
progress.  It  only  retreated.”  He  sarcastically  praised  the  Army’s  “fine  spirit 
of  routine”  and  denounced  its  ciphers  as  “a  public  danger.” 

The  book  is  not  entirely  polemic.  Bazeries  outlined  the  major  systems  of 
cryptology,  related  some  entertaining  history,  and  disclosed  how  he  solved 
the  anarchist  and  Orleans  messages.  He  surveyed  the  current  literature  with 
Olympian  hauteur  and  convicted  authors  like  Josse  and  de  Viaris  of  “heresy” 
when  they  asserted  views  contrary  to  his  own.  The  book  exudes  his  personality. 
Bazeries  invested  even  an  arid  technical  discussion  with  his  astringent  tone: 
“To  abandon  the  methods  of  substitution  for  those  of  transposition,”  he 
pontificated,  “is  to  change  a one-eyed  horse  for  a blind  one.”  That  Bazeries 
lost  his  fight  with  the  administration  is  cryptology’s  gain,  for  the  upshot  was 
probably  the  most  readable  book  in  the  whole  of  the  science.  The  author’s 
victory  is  that  in  it  he  lives  still. 

It  will  be  noted  that,  despite  their  differences,  both  Bazeries  and  the  French 
general  staff  agreed  almost  axiomatically  on  ciphers  for  field  operations  in- 
stead of  codes.  The  practice  was  almost  universal  during  those  years,  and  it 
testifies  to  the  ascendancy  of  the  field  cipher.  Spain  employed  a system  in 
which  a mixed  plaintext  alphabet  slid  over  a list  of  two-digit  ciphertext 
groups  from  10  to  99 ; the  position  of  the  alphabet,  and  hence  the  homophonic 
equivalents  for  each  letter,  changed  from  message  to  message.  The  worthless- 


251 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

ness  of  the  system  was  exposed  in  1894  by  a lieutenant  of  infantry,  Joaquin 
Garcia  Carmona,  in  his  Tratado  de  Criptografia,  the  finest  book  on  the  subject 
in  Spanish  and  one  of  the  better  ones  in  any  language. 

In  Cuba,  Jose  Marti,  that  island’s  great  apostle  of  freedom,  was  using  a 
numerical  Vigenere  to  direct  the  revolutionary  struggle  during  the  early  1890s. 
For  example,  on  December  8,  1894,  he  wrote  from  New  York,  in  his  famous 
plan  for  the  rising  in  Cuba:  “1.  Todos  los  trabajos  deberan  dirigirse  desde 
ahora  con  la  idea  de  comenzar,  todos  unidos,  16,  3,  5,  10,  16,  7 | 17,  16,  7,  22, 
19,  6,  | 20,  19,  22,  6,  36,  6,  | 23,  23,  7,  15,  20,  22.”  He  had  applied  the  key 
HABANA  to  a tableau  whose  alphabets  included  the  Spanish  letters  //  and  h. 
Deciphered,  this  portion  read,  hbcia  [hacia\  fines  del  presente  mes,  making  the 
entire  clause:  “1.  All  the  work  must  be  directed  from  now  with  the  idea  of 
beginning,  all  together,  towards  the  end  of  the  current  month.”  The  revolt 
indeed  broke  out  early  in  1895.  And  even  in  faraway  Ethiopia  a polyalphabetic 
substitution  with  mixed  alphabets  played  its  role  during  the  confused 
warfare  of  that  ancient  land  to  retain  its  independence  against  the  colonial 
powers. 

But  while  armies  clung  to  ciphers,  navies  and  foreign  ministries  employed 
codes.  These  swollen  descendants  of  the  nomenclators  afforded — when  kept 
secret — greater  security  than  a cipher,  and  they  saved  cable  tolls  for  diplomats 
and  signal  time  for  commodores.  Most  of  the  codes  were  one-part,  and  most 
listed  both  codenumbers  and  codewords  as  replacements  for  the  plaintext. 
Each  had  advantages.  The  codewords  were  far  less  susceptible  to  transmission 
error  than  the  codenumbers.  The  addition  or  omission  of  a single  Morse  dot 
in  a cable  could  change  a codenumber  from  7261  to  7262  and  alter  the 
reading  from  he  will  to  he  will  not,  since  the  alphabet  usually  placed  such 
phrases  above  their  negatives  in  the  code.  This  is  less  likely  to  happen  with 
codewords,  like  malsania  and  malsanos. 

On  the  other  hand,  codenumbers  were  easier  to  handle  in  superencipher- 
ment. Superencipherment  consists  of  enciphering  codenumbers  or  codewords 
to  provide  extra  security.  Straightforward  substitution  could  be  used.  A 
sequence  of  codewords  like  palmeto  feodaliser  contabor  angrollen  could 
be  enciphered  in  mon  alphabetic  substitution,  or  Vigenere,  or  any  system, 
just  as  if  it  were  ordinary  language.  (Transposition  systems  seem  not  to  have 
been  used  because  they  would  destroy  the  codewords.  Code  language  did  not 
regularize  into  five-letter  groups  until  July  1,  1904,  when  new  cable  regula- 
tions went  into  effect.)  Fikewise,  codenumbers  could  be  transformed  into 
letters  by  a key.  Often  a 10-letter  word  with  no  repeated  letters,  like  republi- 
can, served  to  convert  the  numbers  on  the  basis  of  1 = r,  2 = e,  and  so  on. 
But  such  superencipherments  were  used  much  less  often  than  two  others, 
based  on  codenumbers. 

One  transposed  the  codenumber  digits.  For  example,  8264  could  be 
shuffled  to  any  of  23  other  permutations.  This  method  was  proposed  by  F.-J. 
Sittler  to  attain  secrecy  in  his  best-selling  commercial  code,  first  published 


252 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


in  1868.  In  the  Sittler  code,  the  first  two  codenumber  digits  indicated  the 
page,  the  second  the  line.  The  encoder  could  represent  these  mnemonically  by 
pa  and  li,  the  codenumber  as  a whole  by  pali,  and  the  encipherment  by 
whatever  combination  was  desired,  as  ipla. 

The  second  superencipherment  was  a form  of  substitution;  the  “alphabet” 
was  the  ordinary  scale  of  numbers.  This  method  added  a keynumber,  called 
an  “additive,”  to  the  original  codenumber,  called  the  “plain  code,”  or 
“placode.”  The  sum  constituted  the  final  cryptogram,  called  the  “enciphered 
code”  or  “encicode.”  In  the  late  19th  century,  a single  keynumber  usually 
served  as  the  additive  for  all  the  codegroups  of  a message.  For  example,  the 
placode  2726  7074  8471  might  be  enciphered  with  the  additive  2898  to  yield 
the  encicode  5634  9972  1369 — with  the  extra  1 that  would  precede  1369 
dropped  as  being  understood.  A rudimentary  form  of  this  additive  method 
had  been  used  a century  earlier  by  Benedict  Arnold,  who  added  a 7 to  the 
digits  of  his  dictionary  code. 

It  was  possible,  however,  to  obtain  the  advantages  of  both  easy  super- 
encipherment and  transmission  accuracy  by  utilizing  the  code’s  parallel  lists 
of  codenumbers  and  codewords.  The  code  clerk  would  note  the  numerical 
placode  for  his  phrase,  say  3043,  mentally  add  the  additive,  which  would  have 
to  be  a simple  figure  like  800,  and  then  take  the  codeword  opposite  the  inter- 
mediate encicode,  3843,  as  the  final  encicode.  (Somewhat  the  same  thing  had 
been  done  with  dictionary  codes  in  the  United  States  in  1876  by  J.  N.  H. 
Patrick  in  his  telegrams  concerning  presidential  electors  for  Oregon.)  In  this 
method,  the  conversion  from  codenumbers  to  codewords  contributes  a 
security  bonus.  Cryptanalysts  would  find  it  easier  to  determine  the  additive 
for  numerical  placode-encicode  pairs,  like  10053  and  12053,  than  for  literal 
pairs,  like  cavarono  and  cianico,  which  furnish  only  the  most  generalized 
clue  to  the  number  of  code  elements  between  them. 

This  system,  probably  the  most  secure  and  advanced  code  system  of  the 
day,  appears  to  have  been  used  by  the  United  States  Navy  at  the  time  of  the 
Spanish-American  War.  It  marked  the  latest  stage  in  Navy  secret  communica- 
tions. In  1809,  a simple  monalphabetic  had  served  for  messages  from  the 
Navy  Department  to  its  future  hero,  Commander  David  Porter,  at  New 
Orleans.  Responsibility  for  naval  cryptography  then  rested,  as  it  had  since  the 
Navy  was  founded,  with  the  senior  member  of  the  Navy  Board.  In  1842,  with 
the  establishment  of  the  bureau  system,  the  cryptographic  responsibility  was 
assigned  to  the  Bureau  of  Construction,  Equipment,  and  Repair.  In  1853,  it 
was  transferred  to  the  Bureau  of  Ordnance  and  Hydrography,  and  in  1862  to 
the  Bureau  of  Navigation,  which  retained  it  until  1917.  In  1877,  the  Navy  was 
using  a Vigenere  for  at  least  some  of  its  communications,  and  in  1887  it 
printed  the  Navy  Secret  Code,  which  was  still  in  use  in  1898,  apparently 
with  a superencipherment.  Naval  cryptography  glinted  briefly  in  the  tumult 
surrounding  the  reception  and  decoding  of  one  of  the  most  thrilling  code 
messages  of  the  era.

As  war  approaches:  Admiral  Dewey  gets  a coded  message  from  Navy  Secretary 
Long  warning  Keep  full  of  coal,  the  best  that  can  be  had 


254 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Ever  since  rumors  had  reached  the  United  States  of  the  momentousness  of 
Admiral  George  Dewey’s  victory  over  the  Spanish  fleet  in  Manila  Bay  on  May 
1,  1898,  the  country  had  been  in  a fever  of  anxiety  to  hear  the  official  report. 
Elaborate  preparations  had  been  made  to  process  it.  Consul  Wildman  at 
Hong  Kong,  who  was  expected  to  get  the  first  word  by  ship  from  Manila,  was 
ordered  to  cable  the  message  without  delay.  Officials  remained  on  24-hour 
duty  at  the  State  Department  and  in  the  Navy’s  Bureau  of  Navigation,  which 
would  decode  the  cable.  At  4 : 40  a. m.  on  the  rainy  morning  of  Saturday,  May  7, 
the  message  “Hong  Kong,  McCulloch,  Wildman”  arrived,  indicating  that  the 
revenue  cutter  McCulloch  had  arrived  with  Dewey’s  report  and  that  the 
Admiral’s  dispatch  would  follow  shortly.  Within  half  an  hour,  Secretary  of 
the  Navy  John  D.  Long  was  notified.  Soon  the  whole  city  was  wild  with 
excitement. 

About  9 : 30,  Mr.  Marcan,  manager  of  the  Western  Union  office,  appeared 
at  the  Navy  Department  with  a sheet  containing  the  mysterious  jargon  in 
which  Dewey  had  coded  his  report.  He  handed  it  directly  to  Long,  who  looked 
hard  at  its  88  codewords,  as  if  he  would  wrest  their  meaning  from  them  by 
sheer  force  of  personality.  But  all  his  straining  anxiety  could  not  draw  an 
iota  of  sense  from  the  message,  which  began : 

CRAQUIEREZ  REFRENANS  VIJFVOETIG  IMPAZZAVA  PRESABERE  INTRUSIVE 
REGENBUI  EDIFIERS  RETAPIEZ  DECRUSAMES  IMPAVIDEZ  RIBOTIEZ  GOLD- 
KRAUT  RIONORAI  SANSCRITO  . . . 

He  handed  it  to  Lieutenant  (j.g.)  Humes  S.  Whittlesey,  one  of  the  crypto- 
graphic officers,  who  disappeared  with  it  into  the  Bureau  of  Navigation.  Then 
Long  pretended' to  transact  other  business  at  his  desk. 

Just  after  10  o’clock,  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Navy,  Theodore 
Roosevelt,  who  had  been  in  the  Bureau  of  Navigation,  stepped  into  the  midst 
of  the  waiting  newspapermen  and  announced,  “Dewey  has  destroyed  or 
captured  all  six  cruisers.”  Reporters  rushed  for  the  telephones;  messenger 
boys  pedaled  furiously  through  the  rain.  Soon  thereafter,  Long  came  out  and, 
standing  in  the  corner  window  where  the  light  was  good,  read  out  the  plain- 
text: Squadron  arrived  at  Manila  at  daybreak  this  morning.  Immediately 
engaged  the  enemy  and  destroyed  the  following  Spanish  vessels:  Reina  Cristina, 
Castillia,  Don  Antonio  de  Biloa,  Don  Juan  de  Austria,  Isla  de  Luzon,  Isla  de 
Cuba.  . . . The  list  of  names  seemed  to  run  on  endlessly.  When  he  finished, 
cheers  rang  through  the  room,  and  then  swept  the  country.  Not  until  much 
later  did  the  nation  decode  the  real  meaning  of  the  message:  that  the  United 
States,  having  conquered  possessions  around  the  globe,  had  started  on  the 
road  to  international  commitment. 

At  9 a.m.  on  October  15,  1894,  Captain  Alfred  Dreyfus  of  the  French 
general  staff  reported  to  a meeting  of  several  superior  officers  at  the  War 
Ministry  on  the  Rue  Saint-Dominique  in  Paris.  They  suspected  him  of  having 


255 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

written  a document  that  offered  military  information  to  Germany,  the  so- 
called  bordereau,  or  memorandum.  After  the  captain  took  some  dictation  to 
test  his  handwriting,  which  resembled  that  of  the  bordereau.  Major  Marquis 
Mercier  du  Paty  de  Clam  arose,  placed  his  hand  on  Dreyfus’  shoulder,  and 
intoned,  “Captain  Dreyfus,  in  the  name  of  the  law  I arrest  you.  You  are 
accused  of  high  treason.” 

Though  the  arrest  was  kept  secret  at  first,  the  anti-Semitic  journal  La  Libre 
Parole  scooped  the  rest  of  the  Paris  press  on  November  1 with  the  headline, 
“High  Treason!  Arrest  of  the  Jewish  Officer,  A.  Dreyfus!”  The  newspapers 
indicated  that  Dreyfus  was  in  the  pay  of  Germany  or  Italy,  and  that  very  day 
the  Italian  military  attache,  Colonel  Alessandro  Panizzardi,  wrote  to  his  chief 
in  Rome  that  neither  he  nor  his  German  colleague  knew  anything  of  the 
prisoner,  though  he  conceded  that  Dreyfus  may  have  worked  directly  for  the 
Italian  general  staff  without  Panizzardi’s  own  knowledge.  As  the  clamor 
mounted  in  the  press,  Panizzardi  next  day  felt  it  necessary  to  telegraph  that, 
if  Dreyfus  had  not  been  in  contact  with  Rome,  an  official  denial  should  be 
published  to  quell  newspaper  comments. 

The  message  of  November  2 went  out  in  code  and,  like  all  other  diplo- 
matic cryptograms  passing  over  the  wires  of  the  French  Ministry  of  Posts  and 
Telegraphs,  an  onionskin  copy  of  Panizzardi’s  text  was  sent  to  the  Foreign 
Ministry  for  an  attempt  at  solution.  This  cryptogram,  which  was  to  become 
the  most  sensational  secret  message  of  those  gaslight  years,  read: 

Commando  stato  maggiore  Roma 

913  44  7836  527  3 88  706  6458  71  18  0288  5715  3716  7567  7943  2107 

0018  7606  4891  6165 

Panizzardi 

The  ministry’s  Bureau  du  Chiffre  consisted  of  seven  men.*  Its  chief, 
Charles-Marie  Darmet,  who  was  two  weeks  short  of  his  59th  birthday  when 
the  Panizzardi  telegram  came  in,  had  joined  the  ministry  as  an  employee  in  the 
archives  bureau  40  years  previously,  and  had  moved  over  to  the  cipher 
bureau  three  years  later.  He  had  served  as  a delegate  to  the  Congress  of  Berlin 
in  1878,  possibly  with  secret  cryptanalytic  duties.  His  rise  through  the  ranks 
culminated  in  his  appointment  on  January  22,  1891,  as  chief  of  the  cipher 
bureau  with  a salary  somewhere  between  7,000  and  10,000  francs.  His  deputy 
chief  was  Albin-Chrysostome  Marnotte,  54,  who  had  served  in  the  cipher 
bureau  for  just  under  37  years  and  had  become  deputy  the  same  day  that 
Darmet  became  chief.  The  others  were  Maurice-Edme-Ludovic  Gaillard,  53, 
with  23  years  in  the  cipher  bureau ; Charles  Dauchez,  46,  also  with  23  years’ 
service;  Louis-Marie-Leonor  Beguin-Billecocq,  29,  seven  years  in  the  bureau; 
Francois  Billecocq,  29,  four  years’  service;  and  Joseph-Gabriel-Claude- 

* Whether  Bazeries,  who  had  been  lent  to  the  ministry  in  September,  was  serving  in 
the  cipher  bureau  at  the  time,  existing  records  do  not  say.  His  discussion  of  the  Panizzardi 
telegram  in  his  book  is  so  sketchy  that  it  seems  unlikely  that  he  participated  in  its  solution.

Page  75  of  the  Baravelli  commercial  code,  used  in  the  Panizzardi  telegram 


Hippolyte  Meziere,  21,  two  years’  service.  The  three  older  men  had  all  been 
made  chevaliers  of  the  Legion  d’Honneur;  the  four  younger,  all  with  law 
degrees,  seem  to  have  been  recruited  directly  into  the  cryptanalytic  service. 

The  cryptanalysts  recognized  Panizzardi’s  intermixture  of  one-,  two-, 
three-  and  four-digit  groups  in  a single  message  as  that  of  an  Italian  com- 
mercial code  published  earlier  that  year  in  Turin  by  Paolo  Baravelli,  an 


257 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

engineer.  This  code,  entitled  Dizionario  per  corrispondenze  in  cifra,  was  con- 
structed in  four  sections:  table  I,  in  which  vowels  and  punctuation  marks 
were  represented  by  single  digits  from  0 to  9;  table  II,  in  which  consonants, 
grammatical  forms,  and  auxiliary  verbs  were  represented  by  pairs  of  digits ; 
table  III,  consisting  of  syllables  indicated  by  three-digit  groups;  and  a 
vocabulary  proper,  in  which  words  and  phrases  were  represented  by  four- 
digit groups.  Some  four-digit  groups  were  left  blank  so  the  user  could  insert 
terms  he  found  necessary. 

The  codebreakers  furthermore  remembered  the  Baravelli  code  from  an 
amusing  incident  of  a few  months  earlier.  In  June,  a mysterious  correspondence 
had  been  daily  burning  up  the  wires  between  the  Count  of  Turin,  a nephew  of 
the  king  of  Italy,  and  the  Duchess  Grazioli,  a tall  and  voluptuous  Italian 
living  at  the  Hotel  Windsor  in  Paris.  Colonel  Jean  Sandherr,  the  dull  and 
stolid  head  of  French  army  intelligence,  thought  it  smelled  of  espionage; 
Maurice  Paleologue,  an  assistant  to  the  Foreign  Minister,  whose  duties 
included  overseeing  the  cryptanalytic  office,  said  that  it  gave  off  only  the  per- 
fume of  romance.  (Paleologue  was  to  become  France’s  World  War  I ambas- 
sador to  Russia  and  a member  of  the  Academie  Framjaise.)  Soon  Sandherr 
burst  into  Paleologue’s  office  with  a small,  flat,  highly  scented  book.  It  was  a 
Baravelli  code.  One  of  Sandherr’s  agents  had  stolen  it  from  beneath  a packet 
of  the  duchess’s  handkerchiefs  while  she  was  at  the  races.  Two  days  later, 
Paleologue  brought  over  the  translations.  They  expressed,  he  said,  nothing 
but  “simple,  elemental,  natural  feelings.  However,  one  four-figure  sequence 
which  recurred  in  most  of  the  telegrams  remained  indecipherable  [presumably 
because  it  stood  for  a blank  that  the  couple  had  filled  in  themselves].  All  that 
our  decoders  were  able  to  suggest  was  that  the  apocalyptic  number  stood 
for  something  extraordinary,  unforgettable  and  sublime!” 

This  experience — in  its  own  way  extraordinary,  unforgettable  and  sub- 
lime— had  taught  the  cryptanalysts  that,  to  achieve  secrecy  in  a volume  that 
was  on  public  sale,  the  Baravelli  employed  an  artifice  common  among  com- 
mercial codes  of  the  day.  On  each  of  the  100  pages  devoted  to  the  vocabulary, 
the  words,  phrases,  and  blank  spaces  were  distributed  in  two  columns  of  50; 
each  was  assigned  a printed  number  from  00  to  99.  Each  page  was  also 
numbered  at  its  lower  outside  corner  by  two  small  printed  digits  that  ran 
from  00  on  the  first  page  of  the  vocabulary  to  99  on  the  last.  The  user  could 
either  superencipher  these,  or  he  could  fill  in  his  own  page  number  following 
the  large  printed  “Pag.”  at  the  top  of  each  page.  He  was  to  combine  these  two 
digits  with  the  two  digits  for  the  words  into  the  four-digit  figure  of  the 
vocabulary  section. 

Similar  arrangements  were  provided  in  the  other  sections.  Table  III 
(syllables)  was  set  up  in  precisely  the  same  way,  except  that  the  ten  pages 
were  given  single  instead  of  double  digits.  Table  II  (grammatical  forms,  con- 
sonants) was  divided  into  ten  groups  of  ten  elements;  the  first  number,  in- 
dicating the  group,  was  provided  with  a dotted  line  on  which  a substitute 


258 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


could  be  written;  the  second  number,  indicating  the  element  in  that  group, 
was  printed.  The  ten  numbers  of  Table  I (vowels,  punctuation)  were  each 
preceded  by  a dotted  line. 

The  Foreign  Ministry  cryptanalysts  undoubtedly  attempted  to  read  Paniz- 
zardi’s  message  using  all  printed  numbers — in  other  words,  without  any  sub- 
stitutes for  the  page  or  group  numbers.  The  attempt  yielded:

This  gibberish  showed  that  Panizzardi  had  made  use  of  a superencipherment. 
It  was  the  task  of  the  French  cryptanalysts  to  determine  it — a task  made  more 
difficult  by  the  fact  that  this  message  was  the  first  sent  by  Panizzardi  in  this 
particular  system. 

They  were  abetted,  however,  by  the  peculiar  construction  of  the  Baravelli 
code,  in  which  the  portion  of  each  placode  number  representing  the  line 
remains  invariable  because  it  is  printed.  With  this  as  a start,  and  with  the 
agitations  of  the  Dreyfus  disclosures,  the  cryptanalysts  had  little  trouble  in 
determining  that  the  arrested  man’s  name  figured  in  the  cryptogram.  The 
plaintext  elements  available  in  the  Baravelli  code  permit  the  word  Dreyfus 
to  be  broken  up  for  encoding  in  only  one  way:  dr,  e,y,fus.  Both  dr  and fus  are 
found  in  Table  III : page  2,  line  27  for  dr;  page  3,  line  06  for  fus.  They  is  found 
in  Table  II,  group  9,  line  8;  and  the  e in  Table  I,  line  1.  In  placode  form,  then, 
Dreyfus  would  be  227  1 98  306. 

Now  the  Panizzardi  telegram  includes  a similar  sequence  of  codegroups 
composed  of  three,  one,  two,  and  three  digits:  527  3 88  706.  Furthermore,  the 
numbers  in  this  sequence  that  presumably  represent  the  lines — 27,  8,  and  06 
(omitting  the  single  digit  from  Table  I) — are  identical  with  those  for  Dreyfus. 
Obviously,  then,  the  sequence  527  3 88  706  represented  Panizzardi’s  encicode 
for  Dreyfus.  From  this,  the  cryptanalysts  could  see  that  the  digits  representing 
lines  were  not  enciphered.  They  also  had  ascertained  the  encipherment  of  two 
of  the  Table  III  pages,  of  one  group  in  Table  II,  and  of  a line  of  Table  I. 

With  this  as  a start,  the  Foreign  Ministry  cryptanalysts  produced — perhaps 
by  the  very  next  day — a preliminary  decryptment  that  read:  “Arrested  [is] 
Captain  Dreyfus  who  has  not  had  relations  with  Germany.  . . .”  This  text, 
highly  hypothetical,  and  in  which  the  only  certain  word  was  Dreyfus,  was  shown 
to  Sandherr,  who  was  in  intimate  and  frequent  contact  with  the  Foreign 
Ministry  cryptanalysts.  He  was  immediately  interested,  for  the  telegram 
bore  on  the  guilt  or  innocence  of  the  central  figure  of  a sensational  scandal 
involving  his  service.  By  Tuesday,  November  6,  the  cryptanalysts  had  per- 
ceived that  the  group  913,  which  they  had  translated  as  part  of  arrestato  in 
their  first  trial,  was  just  Panizzardi’s  serial  number,  and  they  had  reached  a 
solution  which  they  considered  exact,  except  for  the  ending:  “If  Captain 


259 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

Dreyfus  has  not  had  relations  with  you,  it  would  be  wise  to  have  the  ambas- 
sador deny  it  officially.  Our  emissary  is  warned.”  These  last  words  seemed  to 
hint  darkly  at  Dreyfus’  guilt,  and,  though  that  was  the  very  part  that  was 
conjectural,  Sandherr,  who  was  disposed  to  think  Dreyfus  a traitor,  bor- 
rowed the  cryptanalyst’s  worksheet,  with  its  successive  hypotheses  stacked  up 
beneath  each  codegroup  and  with  question  marks  advertising  the  conjectural 
nature  of  the  final  four  words,  uffiziale  rimane prevenuto  emissario.  He  reported 
on  it  to  his  superiors,  remarking  to  Charles  Le  Mouton  de  Boisdeffre,  the 
chief  of  staff,  “Well,  General,  here’s  another  proof  of  Dreyfus’  guilt.” 
Sandherr  had  a copy  made  of  the  worksheet,  which  du  Paty  de  Clam  studied 
with  interest,  and  then  returned  the  original  to  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs. 

By  the  following  Saturday,  November  10,  the  cryptanalysts  had  finally 
cracked  the  system  of  encipherment  used  by  Panizzardi,  recovered  the  placode 
equivalents,  and  established  the  definitive  text  of  the  cryptogram.  It  read, 
with  the  placode  equivalents : 


74  1336

Or,  in  English:  “If  Captain  Dreyfus  has  not  had  relations  with  you,  it  would 
be  wise  to  have  the  ambassador  deny  it  officially,  to  avoid  press  comment.” 

Panizzardi  proved  to  have  used  a relatively  simple  system.  Line  digits  were 
not  touched.  The  two  digits  of  the  vocabulary’s  printed  page  numbers  were 
transposed  and  given  substitutes  according  to  these  alphabets: 


first  placode  digit 
second  encicode  digit 

second  placode  digit 
first  encicode  digit 


0123456789 

9876543210 

0123456789 

1357902468 


Thus  the  placode  1336  of  capitano  became  7836,  and  the  3306  of  evitare  be- 
came 7606.  The  second  of  the  above  two  alphabets  also  served  to  encipher  the 
page,  group,  and  line  numbers  of  Tables  III,  II,  and  I,  respectively.  Thus  the 
placode  page  3 of  the  306  of  fus  became  7 to  give  encicode  706;  the  placode 
of  98  of  y became  88;  and  the  placode  1 for  e became  encicode  3. 

This  version,  which  in  no  way  implicated  Dreyfus,  was  communicated  to 
Sandherr  by  Paul-Henri-Phillipe-Horace  Delaroche-Vernet,  a 28-year-old 
subordinate  of  Paleologue’s  who  served  as  liaison  between  the  cryptanalysts 
and  the  Army  (and  who,  in  1908,  became  chief  of  the  Bureau  du  Chiffre, 
holding  the  post  for  five  years).  Sandherr  was  not  pleased  with  this  new 
version,  and  he  transmitted  it  to  his  chiefs  with  the  observation  that  “with 
Foreign  Affairs,  you  can’t  always  be  certain  about  these  things — they  lack  a 
little  precision.”  Then  one  of  his  subordinates,  Commandant  Pierre-Ernest 


260 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Matton,  a 39-year-old  artilleryman  who  was  the  army  liaison  with  the  Foreign 
Ministry,  had  an  idea  that  would  lay  all  skepticism  to  rest  once  and  for  all.  He 
would  trick  Panizzardi  into  sending  a telegram  whose  contents  were  known

The  Panizzardi  telegram,  with  correct  solution  inserted 

to  the  French ; the  solution  of  this  would  verify  or  refute  the  cryptanalysis  of 
the  Dreyfus  message.  Sandherr  approved. 

Matton  framed  a message  with  words  chosen  from  pages  in  the  Baravelli 


261 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

code  whose  numbers  were  critical  in  the  encipherment  and  with  proper  names 
that  could  be  divided  in  only  one  way.  He  artfully  composed  it  to  be  so  im- 
portant that  Panizzardi  could  not  ignore  it,  and  so  perishable  that  he  would 
have  to  telegraph  it  to  Rome.  It  told  how  “A  certain  Y,  who  is  now  at  X,  will 
leave  within  a few  days  for  Paris.  He  is  carrying  some  documents  relative  to 
the  mobilization  of  the  army,  which  he  obtained  in  the  offices  of  the  general 
staff.  This  person  lives  on  Z street.”  One  of  the  proper  names  was  Schlissen- 
furt,  which  the  Baravelli  can  handle  in  only  one  way.  Matton  had  a double 
agent  slip  it  to  the  Italian  attache.  Panizzardi  fell  for  the  ruse,  encoded  the 
message  almost  verbatim  and  wired  it  to  Rome  at  8: 10  a.m.  November  13. 
The  usual  routine  brought  the  onionskin  copy  to  the  cryptanalysts  of  the 
Quai  d’Orsay.  They,  not  knowing  that  the  Army  had  the  plaintext,  solved  the 
message  and  passed  the  translation  to  the  Army  because  of  its  military  import. 
When  Delaroche-Vernet  brought  it  over,  Matton  says  he  interrupted  the 
young  official  and  said: 

“ ‘Will  you  permit  me?  I am  going  to  get  the  original.’  I went  into  my 
office  and  got  out  the  piece  I had  written.  It  was  word  for  word  the  dispatch 
they  had  deciphered.  I told  him,  ‘You  may  be  sure  now  that  you  have  the 
encipherment.’  ” The  text  that  exonerated  Dreyfus  was  irrefutably  correct. 

So  conclusive  a proof  of  the  solution’s  validity  would  seem  to  have  been 
unchallengeable.  But  this  would  be  to  reckon  without  the  persistence  and 
tenacity  of  those  who  felt  Dreyfus  guilty,  or  who  thought  it  better  to  convict 
Dreyfus  wrongfully  than  to  admit  the  Army  had  erred  and  open  it  to  criticism. 
Boisdeffre  and  his  fellow  generals  refused  to  allow  the  Panizzardi  telegram 
into  evidence  at  Dreyfus’  first  trial,  telling  the  prosecutor  that  the  variations 
of  the  progressively  more  accurate  solutions  negated  the  telegram’s  value  as 
evidence.  Dreyfus  was  found  guilty  of  treason  and  interned  on  Devil’s  Island. 

But  knowledge  of  the  telegram  could  not  be  suppressed,  and  the  anti- 
Dreyfus  officers  finally  slipped  a false  and  highly  condemnatory  version  into 
the  subsequent  trials  and  appeals  of  the  case:  “Captain  Dreyfus  arrested;  the 
Minister  of  War  has  proofs  of  his  relations  with  Germany.  Parties  informed 
in  the  greatest  secrecy.  My  emissary  is  warned.”  This  text  appeared  as  No.  44 
in  the  so-called  Secret  File;  it  had  been  dictated  from  memory  by  du  Paty  de 
Clam,  who  seems  to  have  fabricated  it  from  among  the  various  hypotheses  he 
saw  on  the  original  worksheet  borrowed  by  Sandherr.  This  version  invalidated 
itself  by  the  simultaneous  presence  in  it  of  both  proofs  and  relations.  Both  of 
these  stood  on  line  88  of  different  pages  of  the  Baravelli  code  ( provi  on  page 
71,  relazione  on  page  75),  and  so  both  obviously  could  not  be  the  plaintext 
equivalent  for  the  telegram’s  encicode  0288. 

Faced  with  such  difficulties,  Sandherr  checked  secretly  with  Commandant 
Munier,  a former  secretary  of  the  Military  Cryptography  Commission,  who 
obliged  with  some  obscurantist  professional  cant  to  indicate  that  the  wrong 
version  was  cryptologically  correct.  Finally,  on  April  27,  1899,  Paleologue  and 
two  officers  deciphered  an  authenticated  copy  of  the  original  Panizzardi 


262 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


telegram  for  the  Cour  de  Cassation.  The  result  was,  of  course,  the  same  as  the 
final  version  decrypted  by  the  Foreign  Ministry  cryptanalysts — the  version  in 
which  Panizzardi  by  implication  disclaimed  any  contact  with  Dreyfus.  At 
last  the  correct  solution  entered  the  record.  This  alone  did  not  exonerate 
Dreyfus;  it  was  to  take  seven  more  years  before  he  was  to  receive  justice, 
reinstatement,  and  the  Legion  of  Honor.  (In  the  interim,  the  true  author  of 
the  bordereau  was  found  to  be  Major  Ferdinand  Walsin  Esterhazy ; among  his 
papers,  seized  on  his  arrest,  were  a number  of  cardboard  grilles,  presumably 
for  cipher  communications  with  the  German  military  attache.)  But  the 
demonstration  of  how  the  false  solutions  had  been  used  to  bolster  the  trumped- 
up  anti-Dreyfus  case  helped  clear  the  man  on  Devil’s  Island.  Du  Paty  de  Clam, 
the  officer  who  long  ago  had  arrested  Dreyfus,  himself  exclaimed  on  the 
importance  of  the  telegram,  though  he  intended  his  words  as  a condemna- 
tion. “This  telegram,”  he  declared,  “is,  for  me,  the  pivot  of  the  affair.” 

When  the  Dreyfus  case  was  finally  closed  in  1906,  holocaust  was  less  than 
a decade  away.  During  those  years,  as  the  tensions  increased  and  the  world 
girded  for  battle,  cryptology  received  degrees  of  attention  that  varied  from 
country  to  country  according  to  their  individual  cryptologic  traditions. 
France  had  the  strongest  tradition.  The  published  literature  from  Kerckhoffs 
on  reflected  that  nation’s  profound  understanding  of  the  subject.  Practical 
applications  were  amply  demonstrated  by  the  Panizzardi  telegram,  by  French 
solution  of  the  Italian  Foreign  Office’s  most  secret  codes  three  and  five  years 
after  the  Panizzardi  solution,  and  by  France’s  possession  of  the  German 
diplomatic  code,  which  enabled  her  to  read  critical  German  messages  on  the 
very  eve  of  World  War  I. 

Army  cryptology  was  better  than  Bazeries’  rough  tongue  gave  it  credit 
for.  The  Military  Cryptography  Commission,  which  consisted  of  approxi- 
mately ten  officers  chosen  from  among  all  arms  who  had  shown  an  aptitude 
for  cryptanalysis,  tested  systems  proposed  for  use  by  the  Army  and  studied 
cipher  systems  used  by  other  nations,  particularly  Germany.  The  commission’s 
president  was,  in  1900,  the  inspector-general  of  the  military  telegraph  services, 
General  Francois  Penel,  and  in  that  year  a 37-year-old  engineer,  a graduate 
of  the  Ecole  Polytechnique,  was  attached  to  the  general  staff  as  adjutant  to 
Penel  and  secretary  to  the  commission.  This  was  Captain  Francois  Cartier,  who 
was  to  become  the  chief  of  the  French  military  cryptologic  bureau  in  World 
War  I.  Before  that  war,  Cartier  had  drafted  a memorandum  on  how  to  solve 
German  Army  cryptograms  on  the  basis  of  the  drill  messages,  prefixed  ubchi, 
that  French  radio  stations  had  intercepted  during  German  maneuvers.  The 
commission  obtained  other  information  from  spies,  deserters,  and  recruits  to 
the  Foreign  Legion.  The  members,  who  did  their  cryptologic  work  in  their  spare 
time  and  received  extra  pay  for  it,  formed  a core  of  cryptologists  with  valuable 
experience.  All  this  gave  France  a preponderant  cryptologic  superiority  in 
1914. 


263 


The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

The  Germans,  on  the  other  hand,  seem  to  have  disdained  studying  crypt- 
ology. The  Junkers  felt  that  their  armies  could,  as  in  1870,  overrun  the  French 
by  sheer  force  of  arms.  Cryptanalysis  played  a minor  role  in  intelligence, 
since  it  required  tapping  telegraph  wires  to  intercept  texts.  The  Germans  failed 
to  foresee  how  much  radio  would  be  used  and  how  much  information  would 
flow  in  its  channels.  Hence  the  general  staff  obtained  what  little  it  knew  of 
other  nations’  cryptography  from  its  intelligence  service  and  did  not  waste 
manpower  on  such  frills  as  cryptanalysis.  As  for  their  own  ciphers— were  they 
not  German?  Which  ended  the  discussion.  And  so  German  cryptology 
goose-stepped  toward  war  with  a top-heavy  cryptography  and  no  crypt- 
analysis. 

Marching  with  them  in  the  parade  of  cryptologic  ignorance  were  most  of 
the  other  armies  of  Europe.  England  had  done  little  more  than  distribute 
field  ciphers  to  its  tiny  Army;  Italy  was  about  as  interested  in  cryptology  as  it 
was  in,  say,  social  reform.  There  was  no  organized  military  cryptanalytic 
bureau  in  any  country  except  France — and  Austria-Hungary. 

Perhaps  the  Hapsburg  background  in  cryptanalysis,  stretching  to  the 
Geheime  Kabinets-Kanzlei,  had  conditioned  Austria-Hungary  to  think  in 
those  terms.  In  1908,  she  intercepted  Italian  radiograms,  and  again  in  1911, 
when  they  “rained”  from  the  sky  at  the  outbreak  of  the  Italo-Turkish  conflict 
over  Tripoli.  The  alert  Colonel  Max  Ronge,  later  head  of  the  Nachrichten- 
dienst,  or  intelligence  organization  of  the  general  staff,  saw  the  opportunity. 
In  November  of  1911,  he  instituted  a cryptanalytic  bureau  with  Captain 
Andreas  Figl  as  its  chief.  The  staff  analyzed  Russian  cryptograms,  which 
proved  very  difficult  under  peacetime  conditions,  and  Ronge  purchased  some 
Italian  ciphers  as  a headache-preventative  for  his  cryptanalysts. 

He  was  not  the  only  buyer.  In  the  E.  Phillips  Oppenheim  world  of  prewar 
Eastern  Europe,  codes  and  ciphers  were  bid  up  and  up  like  speculative  shares 
in  a stock-market  boom.  Heading  the  list  were  those  of  Austria-Hungary, 
which,  as  the  crossroads  of  Europe,  was  a virtual  ants’  nest  of  espionage. 

According  to  one  story,  a young  and  remarkably  attractive  Italian  “coun- 
tess,” who  had  become  friendly  with  a lieutenant  in  the  Austro-Hungarian 
headquarters,  sneaked  a copy  of  a red-bound  code  from  an  open  safe  there 
and  replaced  it  with  a book  that  looked  remarkably  like  it — but  that  had  only 
blank  pages!  Some  time  later  a code  clerk  pulled  the  book  out  to  use  it  and 
discovered  the  substitution.  Shock  waves  of  consternation  shook  the  general 
staff.  Frenzied  manhunts  began.  Not  until  the  Russian  attache  had  laughingly 
told  one  of  the  staff  officers  that  he  had  been  offered  the  code,  but  had  turned 
it  down  because  the  400,000  rubles  asked  was  too  much,  did  the  Austrians 
trace  who  had  taken  it. 

Then  there  was  the  time  a mysterious  gentleman  offered  the  Austrians  a 
handwritten  copy  of  the  Serbian  code,  copied  in  snatched  moments  at  the 
risk  of  life  by  his  nephew,  who  worked  in  the  Serbian  code  room.  To  prove 
its  validity,  he  said,  he  would  leave  it  with  the  Austrians,  who  would  test  it  on 


264 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  next  two  Serb  telegrams.  They  came  through  the  very  next  day  and  were 
duly  decoded  with  the  new  key;  they  dealt  with  some  matters  of  custom 
duties — the  dull  routine  of  embassy  affairs.  The  gentleman  got  his  10,000 
kronen  and  the  Austrians  a warm  glow  of  self-satisfaction,  especially  when 
they  reminded  one  another  how  a copied  code  was  less  likely  to  be  changed 
than  a stolen  one.  Soon  more  Serb  messages  trickled  in.  “We  took  our  cipher 
out  of  the  safe,”  recalled  one  former  staff  member,  “arranged  our  dispatches 
on  the  desk,  and  set  to  work.  And  we  kept  on  working — perspiring, 
groaning,  cursing — and  could  not  get  an  intelligible  sentence  out  of  them — 
not  a letter,  a syllable,  a punctuation  point.  With  the  exercise  of  some 
imagination  we  made  one  of  them  read,  The  male  mother  of  the  warship  has 
been  built. 

“Then  we  had  a bright  idea.  We  composed  a dispatch  to  the  ambassador 
and  put  it  into  cipher  with  our  10,000-kronen  key.”  They  marked  it  Urgent 
and  sent  it  off.  Soon  an  angry  little  Serbian  secretary  bounced  into  the  Vienna 
central  telegraph  office  and  demanded  that  three  hopelessly  garbled  telegrams 
be  repeated.  They  were,  of  course,  the  two  that  the  Austrians  had  first  de- 
coded with  their  new  key  and  the  one  that  they  had  made  up  with  it.  What  had 
happened  was  that  the  code  was  a pure  fake,  written  out  by  the  mysterious 
gentleman  himself,  who  had  an  accomplice  send  two  telegrams  in  them  to  the 
Serbian  embassy.  The  Serbs  let  them  lay,  undecoded,  until  the  urgent  wire 
shook  them  into  action. 

But  the  Austrians  were  not  always  on  the  losing  end.  Indeed,  they  showed 
no  little  ingenuity  of  their  own  at  one  time.  Through  cryptanalysis,  they  had 
identified  about  150  words  of  the  Italian  code  used  between  Rome  and 
Constantinople.  Then  they  bogged  down.  So  they  inserted  a tidbit  of  military 
information  into  an  Italian-language  paper  published  at  Constantinople.  As 
they  had  hoped,  the  Italian  military  attache  picked  up  the  item — verbatim, 
as  it  turned  out — and  sent  it  encoded  to  Rome.  The  Austrians  began  phrasing 
their  paragraphs  so  as  to  enlarge  their  vocabulary,  and  within  just  three 
months  they  had  a fairly  workable  Italian  code  of  about  2,000  words. 

As  the  tides  of  history  flowed  toward  war,  nations  tightened  their  alliances 
and  intensified  their  mobilization  efforts.  At  a high-level  meeting  in  London 
in  1911  to  arrange  for  Anglo-French  intercommunications  in  the  event  of  war, 
it  was  decided,  among  other  matters,  to  prepare  an  English-French  codebook. 
Cartier,  who  was  at  the  meeting,  later  returned  for  conferences  with  Britain’s 
Lieutenant  Spiers  on  the  code’s  lexicon  and  its  rules  of  service;  in  1913,  he 
checked  the  final  draft  before  printing.  Soon  thereafter,  Spiers  brought  three 
copies  of  the  codebook  to  Paris — one  for  the  French  G.H.Q.,  one  for  the 
French  Army  that  would  have  the  English  on  their  flank,  a third  for  the 
French  cryptologic  section. 

The  minuteness  of  these  preparations  reflected  that  of  War  Plan  w,  which 
the  British  and  French  general  staffs  had  completed  by  the  spring  of  1914  and

The  Professor,  the  Soldier,  and  the  Man  on  Devil's  Island 

which  specified  the  billet  of  every  battalion  in  the  British  Expeditionary  Force, 
down  to  the  places  where  the  troops  were  to  drink  their  coffee.  The  Central 
Powers  were  no  less  lax,  and  finally,  in  an  obscure  corner  of  the  Balkans, 
someone  helpfully  slew  an  archduke,  and  the  nations  leaped  recklessly  into 
the  bloody  cockpit  of  war.

before  dawn  on  the  morning  of  August  5,  1914,  the  first  day  of  a world 
war  that  was  to  convulse  country  after  country  and  to  end  the  lives  of  mil- 
lions, an  equipment-laden  ship  slid  quietly  through  the  black  and  heaving 
waters  of  the  North  Sea.  Off  Emden,  where  the  Dutch  coast  joins  the  German, 
she  dropped  some  grappling  gear  overboard  with  a dull  splash,  and  shortly 
there  rose  dripping  from  the  sea  great  snakelike  monsters,  covered  with  mud 
and  seaweed.  Grunts  of  men,  chopping  sounds — and  soon  they  were  returned, 
severed  and  useless,  to  the  depths.  These  were  Germany’s  transatlantic  cables, 
her  chief  communications  lifelines  to  the  world,  and  the  vessel  was  the 
British  cable  ship  Telconia.  Though  the  Committee  of  Imperial  Defence  never 
dreamed  of  it  when  it  planned  the  move  in  1912,  the  cutting  of  these  cables, 
England’s  first  offensive  action  of  the  war,  forged  the  first  link  in  a chain  that 
helped  to  end  it. 

Germany  was  now  forced  to  communicate  with  the  world  beyond  the 
encircling  Entente  by  radio  or  over  cables  controlled  by  her  enemies.  She  thus 
delivered  into  the  hands  of  her  foes  her  most  secret  and  confidential  plans, 
provided  only  that  they  could  remove  the  jacket  of  code  and  cipher  in  which 
Germany  had  encased  them.  It  was  an  opportunity  for  which  England  was 
unprepared,  but  of  which  she  promptly  availed  herself. 

On  that  first  day  of  the  war,  the  director  of  naval  intelligence,  Rear 
Admiral  Henry  F.  Oliver,  walked  to  lunch  with  the  only  man  at  the  Admiralty 
to  take  any  interest  in  cryptology,  the  director  of  naval  education,  Sir  Alfred 
Ewing.  A few  months  before,  Ewing  had  devised  what  he  later  called  a 
“futile”  ciphering  mechanism,  and  he  had  spoken  to  Oliver  about  new  methods 
of  constructing  ciphers.  Oliver  mentioned  that  some  naval  and  commercial 
radio  stations  were  sending  to  the  Admiralty  some  messages  in  code  that  they 
had  picked  up  and  that  these  were  accumulating  on  his  desk.  The  Admiralty 
had  no  department  to  deal  with  enemy  cryptograms,  he  said.  Ewing  was  at 
once  interested,  and  when  he  saw  the  messages  that  afternoon  he  recognized 
that  they  were  probably  German  naval  signals  and  that  their  solution  could 
be  of  great  value.  He  at  once  undertook  the  task. 

Ewing  was  then  59,  a short,  thickset  Scot  with  blue  eyes  beneath  shaggy 
eyebrows,  a quiet  voice,  and  the  manner  of  a benign  physician.  He  had  been 

266 


Room  40 


267 


knighted  three  years  before  for  his  contributions  to  science,  which  included 
pioneering  studies  of  Japanese  earthquakes,  of  magnetism,  and  of  mechanical 
lagging  effects  in  stressed  materials  (now  known  by  a word  he  coined, 
“hysteresis”),  and  for  his  public  services,  notably  his  naval  education  direc- 
torship. He  was  to  become  president  of  the  British  Association  for  the 
Advancement  of  Science  and  perhaps  his  country’s  greatest  living  expert  on 
mechanical  science.  And  now  he  was  about  to  found  a cryptanalytic  bureau 
that  was  to  become  almost  legendary  and  to  exert  a direct  and  noticeable 
effect  upon  the  course  of  history. 

He  began  by  boning  up  on  ciphers  in  the  stacks  of  the  British  Museum 
library  and  on  the  construction  of  codes  at  Lloyd’s  of  London  and  at  the 
General  Post  Office,  where  commercial  codebooks  were  on  file.  He  called  in 
four  teachers  at  the  naval  colleges  at  Dartmouth  and  Osborne,  A.  G.  Dennis- 
ton,  W.  H.  Anstie,  E.  J.  C.  Green,  and  G.  L.  N.  Hope,  all  friends  of  his  with 
a good  knowledge  of  German,  and,  sitting  together  around  the  table  in  his 
office,  they  inspected  the  incomprehensible  lines  of  letters  and  numbers  with 
only  the  feeblest  general  idea  on  how  to  begin. 

Among  those  first  messages  was  one  which,  had  they  been  able  to  solve  it, 
might  have  affected  the  entire  course  of  the  war.  It  may  have  been  among  the 
first  batch  that  Oliver  showed  Ewing,  for  it  had  been  issued  at  1:35  a.m. 
August  4 by  the  German  naval  high  command  and  transmitted  by  the  power- 
ful radio  station  at  Nauen  outside  Berlin  to  Admiral  Wilhelm  Souchon,  com- 
mander in  the  Mediterranean.  Message  51  read:  “Alliance  with  Turkey  con- 
cluded August  3.  Proceed  at  once  to  Constantinople.”  Souchon  started  east- 
ward from  the  central  Mediterranean  at  once  in  the  battle  cruiser  Goben  and 
the  light  cruiser  Breslau.  The  British  Mediterranean  squadron,  convinced  that 
Souchon  would  try  to  force  the  Strait  of  Gibraltar,  patrolled  the  waters  west 
of  Sicily  while  Souchon  coaled  at  Messina.  When  a British  cruiser  finally 
spotted  him  heading  east  out  of  the  Strait  of  Messina,  the  squadron  made  a 
frantic  effort  to  catch  and  destroy  him,  but  he  eluded  them  among  the  isles  of 
Greece.  On  Sunday,  August  10,  Goben  steamed  into  the  Dardanelles, 
bringing,  as  Winston  Churchill  later  acknowledged,  “more  slaughter,  more 
misery  and  more  ruin  than  has  ever  before  been  borne  within  the  compass  of 
a ship.”  For  Goben' s strength  and  its  bombardments  of  Russian  Black  Sea 
ports  brought  Turkey  into  the  war  and  sealed  off  Russia  from  her  allies, 
contributing  to  her  eventual  capitulation  and  all  that  that  would  mean.  Had 
the  Admiralty  been  able  to  read  Souchon’s  orders  then  as  they  did  retro- 
spectively later  in  the  war,  England  might  have  won  the  fateful  game  of 
hide-and-seek,  with  consequences  perhaps  greater  than  any  other  single 
exploit  of  the  war. 

Of  all  this,  nothing  was  foreseen  at  Whitehall,  where  on  that  very  Sunday 
Ewing  was,  he  wrote  to  his  family,  “in  the  thick  of  office  work,  special  work 
quite  outside  my  ordinary  lines.”  The  codebooks  of  several  German  com- 
mercial firms  were  being  rounded  up,  but  they  proved  of  no  help.  Not  much

better  was  a mercantile  signal-book  used  by  German  outpost  vessels  that  had 
been  taken  from  a German  merchantman  in  Australia  at  the  outbreak  of  war. 
Meanwhile,  Russell  Clarke,  a barrister  and  a radio  ham,  set  up  the  first  low- 
frequency  intercept  station  at  Hunstanton  to  bring  in  the  raw  material,  and 
soon,  with  the  help  of  Clarke  and  another  ham,  Commander  B.  Hippisley, 
intercepts  were  trickling  in  by  direct  land  line  from  14  coast  intercept  stations 
to  “Ewing  Admiralty.” 

None  of  the  small  band  of  pioneers  had  had  any  real  previous  knowledge 
of  cryptanalysis,  and  they  made  only  antlike  progress  in  those  first  weeks.  But 
Ewing  was  exhilarated  by  the  job,  and  it  was  not  until  October  25  that  he  took 
a Sunday  off.  By  then,  England  had  had  a stroke  of  fortune  that  gave  such  an 
impetus  to  its  cryptanalytic  work  that  it  remained  far  ahead  of  its  enemies 
through  the  rest  of  the  war.  What  happened  has  best  been  told  in  his  own 
style  by  the  minister  who  then  headed  the  Admiralty,  the  First  Lord,  Winston 
Churchill : 

At  the  beginning  of  September,  1914,  the  German  light  cruiser  Magdeburg 
was  wrecked  in  the  Baltic.  The  body  of  a drowned  German  under-officer  was 
picked  up  by  the  Russians  a few  hours  later,  and  clasped  in  his  bosom  by  arms 
rigid  in  death,  were  the  cypher  and  signal  books  of  the  German  Navy  and  the 
minutely  squared  maps  of  the  North  Sea  and  Heligoland  Bight.  On  September 
6 the  Russian  Naval  Attache  came  to  see  me.  He  had  received  a message  from 
Petrograd  telling  him  what  had  happened,  and  that  the  Russian  Admiralty  with 
the  aid  of  the  cypher  and  signal  books  had  been  able  to  decode  portions  at  least 
of  the  German  naval  messages.  The  Russians  felt  that  as  the  leading  naval 
Power,  the  British  Admiralty  ought  to  have  these  books  and  charts.  If  we  would 
send  a vessel  to  Alexandrov,  the  Russian  officers  in  charge  of  the  books  would 
bring  them  to  England.  We  lost  no  time  in  sending  a ship,  and  late  on  an  October 
afternoon  Prince  Louis  [of  Battenberg,  First  Sea  Lord]  and  I received  from  the 
hands  of  our  loyal  allies  these  sea-stained  priceless  documents. 

The  date  was  October  13.  Russell  Clarke,  who  was  as  adept  with  a camera 
as  with  a crystal  set,  copied  it  by  photography  at  his  home.  But  even  the 
astounding  windfall  of  the  Magdeburg  codebook — perhaps  the  luckiest  in  the 
whole  history  of  cryptology — did  not  enable  Ewing’s  team  to  read  the  German 
naval  messages,  for  the  four-letter  codewords  in  that  book  did  not  appear  in 
the  dispatches.  Finally,  Fleet  Paymaster  Charles  J.  E.  Rotter,  a principal 
German  expert,  discovered  that  the  code  had  been  superenciphered  with  a 
monalphabetic  substitution.  Solution  of  such  a superencipherment  is  not  too 
difficult  a problem  with  the  codebook  in  one’s  possession.  As  in  ordinary 
plaintext,  certain  codewords  recur  more  frequently  than  others  and  in  familiar 
clusters,  letters  in  one  codeword  reappear  in  others  in  different  arrangements, 
and  the  codewords  themselves  possess  some  structural  regularities:  in  the  case 
of  the  German  naval  code,  consonants  alternated  with  vowels  in  the  four- 
letter  codewords.  When  these  characteristics  are  known,  the  cryptanalyst  can

spot  them  almost  as  well  as  the  more  pronounced  ones  of  ordinary  language, 
and  can  exploit  them  to  solve  the  superencipherment. 

So  green  were  the  British  cryptanalysts  that  it  took  them  almost  three  weeks 
before  they  began  reading  portions  of  some  German  naval  messages.  These, 
Churchill  says,  “were  mostly  of  a routine  character.  ‘One  of  our  torpedo 
boats  will  be  running  out  into  square  7 at  8 p.m.,’  etc.  But  a careful  collection 
of  these  scraps  provided  a body  of  information  from  which  the  enemy’s 
arrangements  in  the  Heligoland  Bight  [bordering  the  northwest  German 
coast]  could  be  understood  with  a fair  degree  of  accuracy.” 

By  this  time,  Ewing’s  staff  had  grown  to  such  an  extent  that  they  crowded 
his  office,  and  they  were  continually  irked  by  having  to  put  their  work  out  of 
sight  when  he  had  visitors  on  educational  subjects.  So  about  the  middle  of 
November  the  entire  cryptanalytic  group  moved  to  Room  40  in  the  Old 
Buildings  of  the  Admiralty.  This  was  a large  room  with  a small  room  adjoin- 
ing, with  a camp  bed  for  tired  staffers.  Room  40,  O.B.,  had  the  advantage  of 
being  out  of  the  main  stream  of  Admiralty  traffic,  yet  being  relatively  handy 
to  the  Operations  Division,  which  received  its  output.  Though  the  crypt- 
analysts were  later  designated  as  I.D.  25  (section  25  of  the  Intelligence 
Division),  “Room  40”  was  so  convenient  and  so  innocuous  a name  that  it  soon 
became  the  common  identification  for  the  organization.  The  name  stuck 
even  when  I.D.  25  moved  into  larger  quarters. 

For  it  expanded  rapidly.  At  the  end  of  December  an  English  trawler 
brought  up  a heavy  chest  containing  a number  of  books  and  documents  that 
had  been  jettisoned  by  one  of  four  German  destroyers  which  had  been  sunk 
in  an  action  in  the  Heligoland  Bight  October  16.  In  it  was  found  an  important 
German  codebook  that  was  missing  from  the  Magdeburg  find.  The  crypt- 
analysts immediately  used  it  to  read  signals  to  German  cruisers  harassing 
English  shipping,  but  they  did  not  discover  for  several  months  that  it  also 
served  to  encode  messages  between  Berlin  and  German  naval  attaches  abroad. 
The  increase  in  traffic  required  five  new  men,  which  brought  watches  to  two- 
man  strength.  As  additional  codes  were  discovered,  more  staff  was  enrolled, 
frequently  in  a casual  British  manner. 

Francis  Toye,  a young  war-prison  administrator  and  interpreter  who  had 
worked  in  the  British  censorship  and  who  later  became  a widely  known  music 
critic,  attended  a dinner  one  Thursday  evening  at  the  London  home  of 
financier  Max  Bonn.  Among  the  guests  was  one  of  Room  40’s  brighter  mem- 
bers, Frank  Tiarks,  a partner  in  the  banking  firm  of  J.  Henry  Schroder  & Co. 
and  a director  of  the  Bank  of  England. 

“We  talked  a good  deal,”  Toye  recalled,  “and  after  dinner  he  took  me 
aside  and  asked  me  whether  I should  like  to  come  to  the  Admiralty.  Register- 
ing proper — and  wholly  genuine — surprise,  I answered  that  I could  not  see 
what  use  the  Admiralty  is  likely  to  have  for  my  services. 

“ ‘Max  has  just  told  me  that  your  German  is  very  good,’  he  replied;  ‘you 
are  obviously  intelligent  and  presumably,  from  your  record,  trustworthy. 


270 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


There  are  hundreds  of  people  with  one  of  these  qualifications,  a number  with 
two,  but  very  few  with  all  three.  What  about  it?’ 

“ ‘What  about  my  job,  the  War  Office  and  all  that?’  said  1. 

“ ‘If  you’ll  come  you  can  leave  everything  in  our  hands.’ 

“ ‘But  of  course  I’ll  come  if  I’m  really  wanted.’ 

“ ‘Very  well,  I'll  check  up  on  you  and  you’ll  hear  in  due  course.’ . . . About 
a fortnight  later  the  Commandant  sent  for  me  and  silently  handed  me  a War 
Office  telegram:  ‘Lieutenant-Interpreter  Toye  is  to  report  as  soon  as  possible 
to  the  Admiralty  for  special  duty.’  So  omnipotent  and  expeditious  is  the 
British  Admiralty  when  its  mind  is  once  made  up;  think  of  the  yards  of  red 
tape  that  must  have  been  cut  in  those  two  weeks!” 

Meanwhile,  naval  intelligence  was  building  up  activities  concomitant  to 
cryptanalysis.  Major  radio  direction-finding  stations  were — largely  thanks  to 
Oliver’s  foresight — set  up  at  Lowestoft,  York,  Murcar,  and  Lerwick;  they 
fed  their  readings  into  Whitehall,  where  they  proved  of  immense  help  in 
locating  the  German  fleets  and  the  movement  of  the  U-boats.  There  was  no 
way  of  avoiding  a fix  except  by  maintaining  radio  silence.  This  fact  was  of 
course  known  to  the  Germans,  and  in  view  of  it  England  made  no  attempt  to 
keep  its  direction-finding  activity  secret,  using  it  as  a smokescreen  for  its  less 
obvious  and  more  valuable  cryptanalytic  work.  Two  other  sources  of  radio 
intelligence  were  the  identification  of  ships’  radio  call-signs  and  the  recogni- 
tion of  a radio  operator’s  “fist,”  or  characteristic  way  of  sending  Morse  code. 
If  the  Admiralty  knew  that  a call-sign  heard  under  way  in  the  North  Sea 
belonged  to  the  12-gun  battleship  Westfalen , it  would  pursue  tactics  different 
from  those  if  the  call-sign  was  assigned  to  U-20.  This  radio  intelligence,  plus 
cryptanalysis,  plus  other  information  streaming  into  the  Admiralty  was  cor- 
related and  interpreted  by  Admiral  Sir  Arthur  Wilson,  a former  First  Sea 
Lord  and  naval  elder  statesman  who  was  charged  by  Churchill  with  advising 
the  top  war  officials  of  its  substance. 

Thus  it  was  that,  at  about  7 p.m.  on  December  14,  1914,  Wilson  came  to 
Churchill  to  report  that  intelligence  indicated  a sortie  of  German  vessels, 
possibly  against  British  coasts.  Less  than  three  hours  later  the  Admiralty 
ordered  units  of  the  British  fleet  to  proceed  at  once  to  a “point  where  they 
can  make  sure  of  intercepting  the  enemy  on  his  return.”  So  while  the  German 
First  Cruiser  Squadron  hurled  high-explosive  shells  into  the  seacoast  towns 
of  Hartlepool  and  Scarborough  early  on  the  morning  of  the  15th,  four  British 
battle  cruisers  and  six  of  the  most  powerful  battleships  in  the  world  were 
standing  150  miles  to  the  eastward,  cutting  off  their  return.  As  the  Germans 
headed  back  toward  their  base  in  the  Jade  River  at  Wilhelmshaven  on  Decem- 
ber 16  after  the  bombardment,  the  weather  thickened  and  heavy  squalls 
reduced  visibility.  But  the  Admiralty  intelligence  had  placed  the  light  cruiser 
Southampton  so  precisely  in  the  path  of  the  German  vessels  that,  at  10:30  a.m.. 
Commodore  W.  E.  Goodenough  saw  their  shapes  driving  through  the  fog. 
He  could  not  be  sure  that  they  were  not  British  ships  on  station,  however,  so 


Room  40

he  flashed  his  recognition  signal  at  them.  They  failed  to  reply;  he  opened  fire, 
but  soon  lost  contact.  Two  hours  later,  the  heavy  British  forces  sighted  the 
enemy.  But  when  the  commander  of  the  German  light  cruisers  saw  the  giant 
forms  of  the  British  battleships  looming  up  through  the  drizzle,  he,  with 
great  presence  of  mind,  blinked  the  recognition  signal  that  Goodenough  had 
made  to  him  shortly  before.  Then  he  turned  away  and  escaped  behind  the 
curtains  of  mist  before  the  deception  could  be  discovered  and  the  13.5-inch 
guns  could  blow  him  out  of  the  water. 

Disappointment  was  intense  in  the  British  Navy,  which  had  been  straining 
to  test  its  mettle  against  the  German  High  Seas  Fleet.  But  opportunity 
recurred  little  more  than  a month  later,  when  Wilson  marched  into  Churchill’s 
office  about  noon  on  January  23,  1915,  and  announced: 

“First  Lord,  those  fellows  are  coming  out  again.” 

“When?” 

“Tonight.  We  have  just  got  time  to  get  Beatty  there.”  Wilson  explained 
that  the  chief  source  of  his  intelligence  was  Room  40’s  translation — un- 
doubtedly with  the  Magdeburg  codebook — of  a message  sent  at  10:25  a.m. 
that  morning  to  Rear  Admiral  Franz  von  Hipper,  reading:  “First  and  Second 
Scouting  Groups,  senior  officer  of  destroyers,  and  two  flotillas  to  be  selec- 
ted by  the  senior  officer  scouting  forces  are  to  reconnoiter  the  Dogger  Bank. 
They  are  to  leave  harbor  this  evening  after  dark  and  to  return  tomorrow 
evening  after  dark.” 

England  elected  the  same  tactics  as  before,  and  units  under  Vice  Admiral 
Sir  David  Beatty  sailed  to  block  the  German  homeward  trip.  This  time  they 
were  luckier.  Contact  was  made  at  7 : 30  a.m.  next  morning.  When  von  Hipper 
saw  the  numerous  English  forces,  he  collected  his  ships  and  ran.  The  British, 
in  their  faster  super-dreadnought  class  battleships,  gave  chase.  By  9 a.m., 
Lion,  carrying  Beatty,  could  open  fire  at  20,000  yards.  The  action  soon  became 
general  between  the  four  British  and  the  four  German  capital  ships.  Bliicher 
was  sunk,  and  Seydlitz  and  Derfftinger  heavily  damaged,  but  confusion  in  the 
British  squadron  after  a shell  had  crippled  the  flagship  allowed  the  German 
ships  to  escape.  The  Germans  staggered  into  port,  flames  leaping  above  their 
funnels,  their  decks  cumbered  with  wreckage  and  crowded  with  the  wounded 
and  the  dead,  not  to  stir  again  for  more  than  a year. 

This  Battle  of  the  Dogger  Bank  settled  the  confidence  of  the  Admiralty 
in  Room  40,  and  shortly  afterwards  the  terrifying  Lord  Fisher,  the  new  First 
Sea  Lord,  gave  Ewing  carte  blanche  to  get  whatever  he  needed  for  the  better- 
ment of  his  work.  Ewing  augmented  his  staff,  installed  improved  equipment 
in  his  intercept  and  direction-finding  stations,  and  increased  their  number 
to  50. 

At  about  this  time,  the  old  German  superencipherment  failed  to  yield  the 
correct  codegroups.  Room  40  was  now  more  familiar  with  the  quirks  and 
characteristics  of  these  codewords,  and,  after  an  all-night  effort  with  all 
available  staff,  the  new  key  was  discovered.  It  seems  to  have  been  this: 


272 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


placode  abcde  fghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
encicode  I LDSAMXZO  BNCVUG  TWFYP  REH 

This  key  was  used  in  a message  of  February  19,  1915,  directing  the  captain  of 
the  interned  naval  auxiliary  Odenwald  to  act  according  to  his  judgment  and 
to  “avoid  expenses  for  the  empire”: 

placode  kytulocuko  ryharozunu  kozapocuko  larakenume... 
encicode  BEFYNUD  YBU  TEZITUHYVY  BUHICUDYBU  NITIB A V YCA . . . 

Vowels  represented  vowels,  and  consonants,  consonants,  to  retain  the  pro- 
nounceability  of  the  codewords.  In  the  morning  Churchill  himself  called  to 
offer  his  congratulations. 

Solution  of  the  superencipherment — then  worthy  of  a call  from  the  First 
Lord — soon  became  routine.  The  Germans  gradually  accelerated  their  key 
changes  from  once  every  three  months  at  the  beginning  of  the  war  to  every 
midnight  in  1916.  But  by  then  Room  40  had  become  so  proficient  that  the  new 
key  was  sometimes  solved  as  early  as  2 or  3 a.m.  and  nearly  always  by  9 or 
10  a.m. 

Consequently,  when  Vice  Admiral  Reinhard  Scheer,  chafing  under  his 
enforced  inactivity,  decided  to  try  to  entice  the  British  Grand  Fleet  to  where 
his  submarines  could  attack  it  and  his  High  Seas  Fleet  fall  upon  a section  of 
it  without  risking  a general  engagement,  his  orders  lay  at  the  mercy  of 
British  cryptanalysts.  But  it  seems  to  have  been  noncryptanalytic  intelligence 
that  led  the  Admiralty  to  inform  its  Navy  at  5 p.m.  May  30,  1916,  that  the 
High  Seas  Fleet  was  apparently  putting  out  to  sea.  On  this  news,  virtually  the 
entire  Grand  Fleet,  that  mighty  armored  pride  of  England,  built  up  steam 
and  sallied  forth  majestically  from  Scapa  Flow,  Invergordon,  and  Rosyth.  It 
sought  the  major  fleet  action  that  would  give  England  the  undisputed  control 
of  the  seas  on  which  her  strategy  in  the  war  so  heavily  depended. 

Then  there  occurred  one  of  those  trifling  errors  on  which  history  so  often 
turns.  On  sailing,  Scheer  had  transferred  the  call-sign  dk  of  his  flagship 
Friedrich  der  Grosse  to  the  naval  center  at  Wilhelmshaven  in  an  attempt  to 
conceal  his  departure.  Room  40  was  aware  of  this  procedure,  but  when 
queried  on  May  31  as  to  where  call-sign  dk  was,  simply  replied,  “In  the  Jade 
River,”  without  mentioning  the  transfer.  Whitehall  radioed  Admiral  Sir 
John  Jellicoe  that  directional  wireless  placed  the  enemy  flagship  in  harbor  at 
11:10  a.m.  Three  hours  later,  with  Jellicoe  believing  the  Germans  to  be  in 
port,  the  two  fleets  made  contact  in  the  middle  of  the  North  Sea.  This  rather 
shook  Jellicoe’s  faith  in  Admiralty  intelligence.  It  was  further  jolted  when  he 
plotted  the  position  of  the  German  cruiser  Regensburg  as  given  by  an  Admiralty 
report  and  found  that  it  appeared  to  be  in  almost  the  very  same  spot  as  he 
himself  then  was ! No  one  then  knew  that  the  Regensburg  navigator  had  made 
an  error  of  ten  miles  in  his  reckoning  and  that  the  fault  for  the  absurd  result 
lay  with  the  German  officer  and  not  with  the  cryptanalysts  of  Room  40. 


Room  40

After  the  brief  flurries,  of  action,  inconclusive  and  unsatisfactory  to  both 
sides,  that  constituted  the  Battle  of  Jutland,  Scheer  at  9 : 14  p.m.  ordered : “Our 
own  main  body  is  to  proceed  in.  Maintain  course  S.S.E.  1/4E;  speed  16knots.” 
At  9:46,  he  altered  it  slightly  to  S.S.E.  3/4  E.  Both  messages  were  decrypted 
with  almost  unbelievable  alacrity  by  Room  40,  and  by  10:41  a summary  of 
them  had  been  received  aboard  the  flagship.  But  Jellicoe  had  had  enough  of 
Admiralty  intelligence.  Furthermore,  the  summary  had  omitted  Scheer’s 
9:06  call  for  air  reconnaissance  off  the  Horn  Reefs,  which  would  have  con- 
firmed his  intentions,  and  thus  there  was  nothing  to  contradict  a battle  report 
from  Southampton  that  suggested  a different  enemy  course.  Jellicoe  there- 
fore rejected  the  Admiralty  information,  which  this  time  was  right.  As  a 
result,  he  steered  one  way,  Scheer  fled  another,  and  Britain’s  hope  of  a 
decisive  naval  victory  evaporated  in  a welter  of  errors,  missed  chances,  and 
distrust. 

After  Jutland,  the  German  emphasis  on  submarine  warfare  intensified 
Room  40’s  concentration  on  the  U-boat  messages.  These  were  encoded  in  the 
four-letter  code  of  the  High  Seas  Fleet,  but  were  superenciphered  by  columnar 
transposition.  The  Germans  called  the  one  for  the  regular  U-boats  “gamma 
epsilon”  and  that  for  the  larger  cruising  submarines,  whose  keyword  differed, 
“gamma  u.”  Keywords  changed  often  but  not  daily.  Three  or  four  staffers 
specialized  in  this;  they  became  so  adept  that  they  usually  managed  not  only 
to  restore  the  scrambled  codewords  to  their  original  form  but  even  to  recover 
the  keyword  for  the  transposition  tableau.  The  solutions  greatly  assisted  British 
operations,  and  eventually  the  Germans  could  no  longer  chalk  off  as  coinci- 
dental the  repeated  apparitions  of  substantial  British  units  athwart  their 
course.  In  August  of  1916,  they  changed  their  code.  But  Room  40’s  direction- 
finding and  call-sign  sections  were  so  well  oiled  that  they  nevertheless  main- 
tained a fair  flow  of  intelligence. 

They  did  not  have  to  bear  the  burden  very  long,  however,  for  in  September 
a badly  burned  but  legible  copy  of  the  valuable  new  codebook  was  recovered 
from  the  Zeppelin  L-32,  which  had  been  downed  at  Billericay.  Nor  did  the 
Admiralty  rely  entirely  on  fortuitous  circumstances.  In  an  attempt  to  obtain 
whatever  intelligence  it  could  on  new  apparatus  aboard  the  German  sub- 
marines, the  Admiralty  had  some  months  previously  sent  a diver  into  a U- 
boat  sunk  off  the  Kentish  coast.  He  was  Shipwright  E.  C.  Miller,  a thin,  pale, 
but  wiry  young  diving  instructor  possessed  of  an  unusual  courage  and 
capacity  to  stand  pressure  at  greater  depths  than  most  men.  On  his  first 
descent,  he  entered  through  a hole  in  the  U-boat’s  hull  and  reconnoitered 
through  a chill  blackness  with  things  bumping  up  against  him — which  his 
flashlight  showed  to  be  corpses.  Pushing  through  them,  he  opened  a small 
door  aft  of  the  officers’  quarters.  Inside  the  compartment  was  an  iron  box, 
which  was  found  to  contain  the  vessels’  codes. 

Miller  brought  up  so  much  valuable  material  that  he  was  sent  down 


274 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


again  and  again.  It  was  not  pleasant  work.  The  dogfish,  he  said,  “are  always 
about  and  will  eat  anything.  In  the  mating  season  they  naturally  resent  any 
intruder,  and  on  lots  of  occasions  when  they  chased  me  I offered  them  my 
boot,  and  they  never  failed  to  snap  at  it.  . . . There  were  some  pretty  weird 
scenes  inside  the  boats.  ...  I found  scores  of  conger  eels,  some  of  them 
seven  to  eight  feet  long  and  five  inches  or  so  thick,  all  busily  feeding.  They 
gave  one  a bit  of  a shock.”  Despite  the  gruesome  aspects  of  the  job,  Miller 
succeeded  nearly  every  time  in  finding  the  now  familiar  iron  box,  and  from  one 
of  the  60  U-boats  that  he  explored — no  Englishman  was  more  familiar  with 
their  interior  than  he — he  recovered  the  badly  needed  new  German  naval 
code.  After  the  war,  he  was  decorated  at  Buckingham  Palace  by  the  king. 

Miller’s  find  helped  the  cryptanalysts  in  reading  the  increasing  volume  of 
enemy  messages.  Room  40  was  now  approaching  the  height  of  its  power. 
Intercepts  poured  in  through  the  pneumatic  tube  so  fast  that  at  times  the 
discharge  of  its  small  containers  sounded  like  a machine  gun.  (After  the  war 
it  was  estimated  that  from  October,  1914,  to  February,  1919,  Room  40  had 
intercepted  and  solved  15,000  German  secret  communications.)  Work  went 
on  round  the  clock  on  the  naval  messages,  even  during  the  Zeppelin  bombings, 
when  the  lights  were  dimmed  behind  the  close-fitting  dark  blinds.  The  staff 
was  further  increased  by  wounded  officers  and  by  German  university 
scholars,  many  of  whom  were  commissioned  in  the  Royal  Navy  Volunteer 
Reserve  so  that  they  could  wear  uniforms  to  forestall  icy  looks  from  the 
public.  Women  were  enlisted  to  free  cryptanalysts  from  clerical  tasks.  Separ- 
ate sections  were  established  for  naval  and  political  cryptanalysis.  Heading 
the  former  was  A.  G.  Denniston,  one  of  Ewing’s  original  four  musketeers, 
who  proved  exceedingly  skillful  at  cryptanalysis,  who  came  back  to  do  similar 
work  in  World  War  II,  and  who  in  recognition  was  made  a Companion  of 
St.  Michael  & St.  George  and  a Commander  of  the  Order  of  the  British 
Empire.  The  chief  of  the  political  cryptanalysts  was  George  Young,  who  had 
a background  of  diplomacy  that  included  posts  in  Washington,  Athens, 
Constantinople,  Madrid,  Belgrade,  and  Lisbon,  whence  he  quit  a sinecure  to 
work  in  Room  40,  and  who  later  succeeded  to  a baronetcy. 

With  the  increase  in  traffic,  Room  40  ceased  simply  passing  edited  inter- 
cepts to  the  Operations  Division  and  began  sending  daily  summaries  that 
integrated  the  cryptanalytic  with  the  direction-finding  and  other  radio  intelli- 
gence. Captain  H.  W.  W.  Hope  was  replaced  as  editor  and  correlator  of  the 
cryptanalyzed  naval  messages  in  May  of  1917  by  Commander  William  James, 
who  later  became  administrative  head  of  I.D.  25,  or  Room  40.  Starting  in 
November  of  1916,  Hugh  Cleland  Hoy,  secretary  to  the  director  of  naval 
intelligence,  read  through  the  hundreds  of  intercepts  to  sift  the  wheat  from  the 
chaff  and  to  send  the  kernels  on  to  the  proper  division  of  government — the 
Cabinet,  the  War  Office,  or  Scotland  Yard. 

The  staff  included  several  men  who  already  had  or  later  would  achieve  a 
modicum  of  fame.  In  addition  to  Toye,  Tiarks,  and  Ewing  himself,  there  were

Ronald  Knox,  who  later  became  a Catholic  priest  and  made  a highly  praised 
translation  of  the  Bible ; Dr.  Frank  Adcock,  dean  of  Kings  College,  Cambridge, 
who  was  later  knighted  for  his  work  as  one  of  the  three  joint  editors  of  the  11- 
volume  Cambridge  Ancient  History,  and  who  also  served  as  a cryptanalyst  in 
World  War  II ; Desmond  McCarthy,  a widely  known  author  and  critic,  later 
knighted,  who,  like  Knox,  joined  only  late  in  the  war;  the  second  Baron 
Monkbretton,  who  served  as  chairman  of  the  London  County  Council  from 
1920  to  1930;  and  W.  Lionel  Fraser,  later  chairman  of  three  substantial 
financial  firms — Banque  de  Paris  et  des  Pays-Bas,  Cornhill  Insurance  Com- 
pany, and  Scandinvest  Trust,  Ltd. — and  president  of  Babcock  and  Wilcox, 
Ltd.;  Gerald  Lawrence,  the  actor;  and  Professor  E.  Bullough,  chiefly  known 
as  the  son-in-law  of  the  famous  actress  Eleanora  Duse. 

Less  well  known — sometimes  unknown — to  the  public,  but  outstanding  as 
cryptanalysts,  were  Ronald  Knox’s  older  brother,  Dilwyn,  who  is  credited 
with  having  solved  the  three-letter  German  naval  flag  code  in  his  bath,  and 
who  found  cryptanalysis  so  to  his  taste  that  he  made  a career  out  of  it  in  the 
War  Office;  Dr.  John  D.  Beazley,  then  a tutor  at  Oxford  and  later  professor 
of  classical  archaeology  there,  later  knighted;  Dr.  Gilbert  Waterhouse,  pro- 
fessor of  German  at  the  University  of  Dublin,  regarded  as  a “first-class 
performer” ; Dr.  Leonard  A.  Willoughby,  lecturer  in  German  at  Oxford  and 
later  a Freeman  of  the  City  of  London;  Professor  E.  C.  Quiggin,  who  enjoyed 
considerable  success  with  the  Austrian  messages;  and  Dr.  Douglas  Savory, 
professor  of  the  French  language  and  Romance  philology  at  the  University  of 
Belfast,  later  knighted,  who,  after  Quiggin  died,  took  over  the  Austrian 
traffic  and  produced  some  important  solutions. 

Not  all  in  the  Room  40  galaxy  were  cryptanalysts;  in  fact,  in  the  entire 
personnel,  there  were  only  about  50  of  this  exalted  breed.  The  others  were 
support  troops  or  worked  on  the  other  aspects  of  radio  intelligence.  Tiarks 
and  Lawrence,  for  example,  unraveled  the  directional  bearings;  the  call-sign 
section,  where  Toye  worked,  was  directed  by  W.  F.  Clarke,  son  of  the  attorney 
who  had  defended  Oscar  Wilde.  Edward  Molyneux,  later  a famous  dress 
designer,  came  to  work  in  Room  40  answering  a telephone  and  sorting  in- 
coming messages  as  one  of  several  wounded  officers  sent  over  by  the  War 
Office.  The  place  was  loaded  with  peers  and  social  types  and  seemed  to  be 
sort  of  an  Eton  Alumni  Club:  McCarthy,  Lord  Monkbretton,  Young,  Knox, 
and  others  all  had  attended.  The  very  typists  had  to  be  daughters  or  sisters  of 
naval  officers  with  a knowledge  of  at  least  two  foreign  languages!  Their  chief 
was  Lady  Hambro,  who  smoked  cigars. 

The  most  important  personnel  change  came  with  the  retirement  of  Ewing 
and  his  replacement  as  immediate  overseer  of  Room  40  by  the  director  of 
naval  intelligence.  On  May  6,  1916,  Ewing  had  been  offered  the  principalship 
of  the  University  of  Edinburgh.  It  was  an  attractive  offer,  especially  to  one 
who  had  spent  the  25  years  before  becoming  director  of  naval  education  in 
1903  as  a professor  of  engineering  or  of  applied  mechanics.  In  addition,

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Ewing  was  by  this  time  taking  little  part  in  actual  cryptanalysis,  for  as  his  staff 
had  grown,  it  had  come  to  include  persons  whose  talent  for  the  work  far 
exceeded  his  own.  They  would  leap  or  fly  to  conclusions  with  an  agility  in- 
comprehensible, he  said,  to  his  own  pedestrian  wits.  He  was  mainly  admin- 
istrator of  the  department.  He  discussed  the  Edinburgh  offer  several  weeks 
later  with  his  chief,  the  new  First  Lord,  Arthur  Balfour,  who  also  happened  to 
be  chancellor  of  the  University.  Balfour  told  him  that  he  had  organized  Room 
40  so  well  that  he  could  safely  delegate  its  supervision.  Accordingly,  Ewing 
accepted  the  offer  as  of  October  1,  1916,  the  date  on  which  he  ceased  to  be 
director  of  naval  education,  a post  he  had  held — not  without  a certain 
amusement — during  his  captaincy  of  Room  40.  He  continued  to  make  weekly 
visits  to  Whitehall  in  an  advisory  capacity,  but  by  the  following  year  the 
claims  of  Edinburgh  were  becoming  too  insistent  for  double  duty,  and  on 
May  31,  1917,  he  said  goodbye  to  his  Admiralty  friends  once  and  for 
all. 

The  reins  of  Room  40  had  by  then  been  long  since  in  the  firm  grasp  of  a 
most  remarkable  man,  a man  who  made  an  unforgettable  impression  on  all 
those  who  met  him  and  whose  positive  brilliance  in  espionage  ably  served  his 
country  just  when  it  needed  it  most.  He  was  Captain  William  Reginald  Hall, 
R.N.,  director  of  naval  intelligence.  He  had  almost  literally  been  born  for 
intelligence  work:  his  father  had  been  the  first  director  of  the  Admiralty’s 
intelligence  division.  Hall  had  joined  the  Navy  at  14,  had  been  promoted  to 
captain  at  35,  and,  after  commanding  a cruiser  and  a battle  cruiser,  had  been 
appointed  to  the  intelligence  directorship  in  November,  1914.  A dapper, 
alert  man  with  a perfectly  domed,  prematurely  bald  head  and  a large  hooked 
nose,  Hall,  then  in  his  middle  forties,  looked  like  a demonic  Mr.  Punch  in 
uniform. 

But  his  eyes,  with  their  penetrating,  hypnotic  quality,  were  his  most 
remarkable  feature.  “Such  eyes  as  the  man  has!”  the  American  ambassador, 
Walter  Hines  Page,  wrote  to  President  Woodrow  Wilson.  “For  Hall  can  look 
through  you  and  see  the  very  muscular  movements  of  your  immortal  soul 
while  he  is  talking  to  you.”  A nervous  tic  caused  one  of  his  eyes  to  twitch 
incessantly,  giving  him  the  nickname  “Blinker.”  He  burst  with  energy  and 
confidence.  “He  was  the  most  stimulating  man  to  work  for  I have  ever 
known,”  Toye  later  wrote.  “When  ...  he  spoke  to  you,  you  felt  that  you 
would  do  anything,  anything  at  all,  to  merit  his  approval.”  Page  summed  him 
up  best:  “Hall  is  one  genius  that  the  war  has  developed.  Neither  in  fiction  nor 
in  fact  can  you  find  any  such  man  to  match  him.  Of  the  wonderful  things  that 
I know  he  has  done,  there  are  several  that  it  would  take  an  exciting  volume  to 
tell.  The  man  is  a genius — a clear  case  of  genius.  All  other  secret-service  men 
are  amateurs  by  comparison.”  Hall  and  Page  were  soon  to  swirl  together 
through  a grave  international  gavotte  of  intrigue  and  propaganda  that  was  to 
have  the  most  crucial  effects  on  the  war.  But  neither  of  them  guessed  any  of 
that  when  Hall  took  over  officially  from  Ewing  in  the  fall  of  1916. 


Room  40 


277 


Despite  its  efficiency,  England’s  Room  40  held  no  monopoly  on  naval  or 
diplomatic  cryptanalysis  during  the  war.  In  the  cryptanalytic  section  of  the 
French  War  Ministry,  Lieutenant  Paul  Louis  Bassieres  and  the  reserve  inter- 
preter Paul-Brutus  Dejardin  reconstructed  a German  U-boat  code  as  the 
first  triumph  of  their  diplomatic-naval  branch.  Captain  Georges  Painvin 
solved  the  four-letter  German  naval  code,  superencipherment  and  all,  and 
Commandant  Marcel  Givierge  the  three-letter  flag  code. 

Later  in  the  war,  the  French  discovered  that  each  midnight  the  Nauen 
station  broadcast  to  U-boats  in  the  Mediterranean  the  sailing  times  and 
itineraries  of  French  ships  departing  Marseilles — information  that  had 
evidently  been  sent  to  the  Germans  by  waterfront  spies.  French  radio  posts 
intercepted  the  coded  messages  and  telegraphed  them  to  the  cryptanalytic 
bureau.  Depending  on  the  accuracy  of  the  transmission,  the  French  crypt- 
analysts took  between  30  minutes  and  an  hour  to  crack  the  messages.  A mes- 
senger took  the  solutions  to  the  Ministry  of  Marine  by  bicycle,  and  by  3 or 
4 a.m.  the  harbormaster  at  Marseilles  had  been  notified  in  time  for  him  to 
alter  schedules  and  foil  the  waiting  submarines.  Ships  that  had  already  sailed 
were  radioed  to  change  course.  In  one  case,  the  transport  Alger  could  not  be 
contacted  at  sea  because  of  an  electrical  storm.  It  was  torpedoed  and  sunk 
with  a loss  of  500  soldiers  and  considerable  materiel.  The  spies  were  later 
captured. 

The  French  sent  many  of  their  naval  solutions  to  London,  but  Room  40 
reciprocated  as  minimally  as  possible.  Hall  apparently  never  sent  the  Magde- 
burg nor  any  other  in-force  naval  codebooks  to  the  French.  His  motives  were 
understandable.  England  depended  for  her  very  existence  on  control  of  the 
seas,  and  every  additional  person  who  knew  of  the  German  solutions  added 
to  the  danger  of  loss  of  this  supremely  valuable  intelligence  and,  consequently, 
of  the  nation’s  maritime  mastery.  But,  in  the  opinion  of  Colonel  Franqois 
Cartier,  head  of  the  French  cryptologic  service,  Hall  exceeded  all  decent 
bounds  in  his  jealous  hoarding  of  his  cryptanalytic  secrets. 

Once  when  Cartier  was  visiting  Hall,  he  told  the  director  of  naval  intelli- 
gence that  his  bureau  was  cryptanalyzing  the  German  naval  codes  but  had 
only  progressed  to  partial  solutions.  Hall  suggested  that  Cartier  leave  the 
naval  traffic  to  the  British,  who  had  an  actual  copy  of  the  German  code,  could 
read  the  German  messages  with  ease,  and  would  apprise  the  French  of  any- 
thing of  importance  to  them.  Cartier  replied  by  telling  Hall  how  one  of  the 
fragmentary  French  decryptments  had  enabled  them  to  save  one  of  their 
auxiliary  cruisers  from  possible  torpedoing;  the  English  must  have  known  of 
the  danger  from  the  same  intercept,  but  they  had  not  warned  the  French.  The 
intelligence  chief  explained  that  it  was  better  to  lose  the  ship  than  to  take 
precautionary  measures  that  risked  disclosing  the  cryptanalysis  to  the  Ger- 
mans. “Would  you  feel  the  same  way  if  the  cruiser  had  been  English?” 
Cartier  asked  coldly.  Hall  dodged  that  one,  and  a change  of  code  ended  the 
negotiations.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Mutual  need  sometimes  overrode  these  differences,  however,  and  crypt- 
analytic  collaboration  continued  among  the  Allies.  England,  for  example,  read 
the  Berlin-Madrid  diplomatic  messages  in  both  the  Spanish  and  the  German 
codes  and  offered  them  to  the  French;  France  managed  to  solve  a superen- 
cipherment in  this  traffic  the  very  day  that  it  was  put  into  service,  and  then  sent 
the  solution  to  Hall.  It  was  in  this  code  that  the  German  naval  attache  in  Madrid 
radioed  to  Germany  several  times  to  ask  for  funds  and  instructions  for  agent 
h-21.  The  agent,  a beautiful  dancer  better  known  by  her  stage  name  of  Mata 
Hari,  was  ordered  to  Paris.  But  the  French  had  read  the  messages,  which 
were  the  first  concrete  evidence  that  they  had  been  able  to  collect  that  Mata 
Hari  was  a German  spy.  They  picked  her  up,  and  though  she  fiercely  con- 
tended that  the  money  was  a payment  from  her  lovers,  the  messages  convicted 
her.  A few  months  later,  courageously  refusing  a blindfold,  she  was  executed 
by  a twelve-man  firing  squad. 

The  French  also  solved  an  Austro-Hungarian  code,  which  they  later  got 
from  Hall,  and  a naval  code  of  the  same  country,  which  was  superenciphered 
in  a way  that  gave  rise  to  such  peculiar  codewords  as  plesdepots,  cody- 
figaro,  and  ognisexual.  The  French  discovered  in  May  of  1916  that  the  first 
four  digits  of  the  ten  underlying  codenumbers  were  enciphered  in  two  groups 
of  two  and  the  last  six  digits  in  two  groups  of  three.  The  solution  proved  of 
great  value  to  the  Italians.  The  Austrians  apparently  later  changed  this  code, 
for  in  the  autumn  of  1917,  Hall  learned  that  the  Italians  were  having  little 
success  in  obtaining  information  about  the  movements  of  the  Austro- 
Hungarian  fleet,  despite  its  extensive  use  of  wireless.  He  dispatched  three  of 
Room  40's  staff  as  a “special  secret  information  service”  to  study  the  Austro- 
Hungarian  signals,  and  the  British  ambassador  to  Italy  later  wrote  the  foreign 
secretary  that  this  service  “has  been  of  great  value  to  us  to  obtain  rapid  and 
sure  information  of  what  was  going  on  on  the  other  side  of  the  Adriatic,  and 
I do  not  think  either  we  or  the  Italians  would  have  had  much  if  it  had  not  been 
for  the  system  which  he  [Hall]  devised  and  induced  the  Italians  to  work.” 

Just  as  the  reading  of  secret  naval  and  diplomatic  messages  was  not  re- 
stricted among  the  Allies  to  Room  40,  so  it  was  not  restricted  among  the 
belligerents  to  the  Allies.  The  Germans  had  finally  set  up  a cryptanalytic 
section,  with  an  intercept  and  transmission  post  at  Neumunster.  They  succeeded 
in  penetrating  the  British  naval  codes  (whether  by  capture  or  by  cryptanalysis 
is  unknown),  and  during  Jutland  they  read  Jellicoe’s  order  massing  his 
destroyers  to  his  rear  to  shield  from  a torpedo  attack.  Neumunster  passed 
this  order  to  Scheer.  This,  together  with  other  information,  confirmed  his 
position  well  astern  of  the  British  battle  fleet.  He  therefore  thought  it  was 
safe  enough  for  him  to  cross  his  enemy’s  wake — and  he  did,  running  safely 
for  home  without  encountering  the  superior  British  dreadnoughts. 

Room  40  intercepted  and  read  this  message.  Whether  it  specifically 
motivated  them  to  change  or  improve  their  naval  systems  is  unknown,  but  it 
is  certain  that  they  ended  the  war  with  unquestionably  the  era’s  finest  code. 


Room  40

This  is  Cypher  sa,  apparently  invented  by  one  J.  C.  F.  Davidson,  who  received 
£300  for  it.  It  went  into  force  at  noon  August  1,  1918,  replacing  Cypher  w. 

Despite  its  name,  it  was  a two-part  code,  bound  in  two  volumes  in  the 
standard  lead  covers  so  it  would  sink  when  jettisoned  in  time  of  danger.  The 
encoding  section  ran  341  pages  and  gave  five-digit  codenumbers  for  every- 
thing from  A to  Zwyndrecht,  with  up  to  15  homophones  for  many  plaintext 
expressions.  Ship,  for  example,  had  that  many,  but  the  effective  number  was 
even  larger  because  of  the  35  phrases  containing  the  word  ship,  as  ship  will  be, 
which  itself  had  three  homophones,  plus  the  separate  entries  for  ships,  ship- 
ping, shipped,  and  so  on.  The  code  included  two  pages  of  nulls,  tables  of 
digraphs  and  single  letters  for  spelling  words  not  in  the  vocabulary,  separate 
sections  for  numbers,  dates,  message  references,  senior  officers’  names, 
British  navy  warships,  and  names  of  foreign  men-of-war,  as  well  as  indicators 
to  shift  to  a separate  “code  index”  with  names  of  important  merchantmen 
and  steamship  companies.  The  536-page  decoding  section  ran  from  00100  (for 
Vathy)  to  53698  (for  Nought  one  four  five),  but  many  numbers  were  skipped 
in  the  codegroup  series;  at  one  point,  for  example,  it  ran  07401,  07403,  07404, 
07406.  The  instructions  called  for  the  use  of  at  least  25  per  cent  nulls  in  every 
message — which  had  to  start  with  one. 

The  code’s  major  feature,  however,  was  its  extensive  use  of  the  polyphone, 
a codegroup  that  has  multiple  meanings.  Obviously,  if  codegroup  07640  can 
mean  either  eight,  or  fifth  April,  or  then  North-ward,  the  task  of  the  crypt- 
analyst becomes  substantially  more  difficult.  This  situation  prevailed  in 
Cypher  sa  with  a large  percentage  of  the  groups.  How,  then,  could  the 
legitimate  decoder  keep  the  meanings  separate,  so  that  he  would  not  inad- 
vertently select  eight  when  fifth  April  is  meant?  The  code  distinguished 
between  the  three  meanings  by  tagging  the  three  polyphones  with  an  a,  a b, 
or  a c both  fore  and  aft  of  the  codenumber.  In  encoding,  the  code  clerk  had 
to  pick  the  codegroup  that  had  the  same  letter  in  front  of  it  as  the  codegroup 
preceding  had  behind  it.  In  other  words,  a group  ending  with  a b must  be 
followed  by  one  beginning  with  a b.  The  code  was  so  constructed  that  wher- 
ever the  clerk  had  to  make  this  selection,  a choice  of  codegroups  was  provided. 
All  the  polyphones,  in  other  words,  were  homophones  (but  not  vice  versa).  The 
code  clerk  dropped  the  letters  before  transmitting  the  cryptogram.  The 
decoder  could  pick  up  the  thread  with  the  first  group,  a null,  because  all 
the  nulls  and  many  plaintext  groups  were  prefixed  with  a dash.  This  meant  that 
they  did  not  have  to  follow  any  particular  letter,  and  so  could  serve  as  the 
free  end  of  a chain.  The  letter  at  their  tail,  however,  forged  the  first  link  in  this 
chain,  which  the  decoder  tracked  through  his  codebook. 

Polyphones  are  a powerful  weapon  for  confusing  a cryptanalyst,  for  a 
codegroup  may  not  always  be  what  it  seems.  This  is  not  to  say  that  Cypher  sa 
was  unbreakable;  but  it  undoubtedly  would  have  demanded  considerably 
more  time,  more  traffic,  and  more  corollary  information  than  others.  The 
connoisseur  may  also  revel  in  its  exquisite  ingenuity.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Hall’s  supersession  of  Ewing  roughly  coincided  with  the  end  of  the  great 
sea  battles.  This  was  largely  due  to  Room  40.  “Without  the  cryptographers’ 
department  there  would  have  been  no  Battle  of  Jutland,”  Churchill  wrote, 
and  Jutland  bottled  up  the  German  fleet  so  effectively  that  it  never  ventured 
forth  again.  The  closing  of  this  phase  of  the  war  reduced  the  need  for  tactical 
intelligence,  and  Hall,  as  aggressive  as  any  man,  shifted  the  emphasis  to  the 
strategic.  He  gained  access  to  the  larger  and  more  exciting  arena  of  inter- 
national affairs  through  Room  40’s  diplomatic  decryptments.  This  was 
usurpation  of  power,  for  his  province  was  nominally  just  naval  intelligence, 
and  indeed,  while  the  Foreign  Office  appreciated  his  information,  it  grudged 
him  his  powers.  But  it  was  helpless  to  stop  him,  for  his  control  of  Room  40 
made  him  absolute  master  of  the  vital  information  it  produced,  from  dis- 
closures of  the  far-flung  subversions  and  conspiracies  and  aggrandizements  of

the  Central  Powers  to  the  coded  squeakings  of  a minor  spy.  Though  Hall 
did  pass  this  information  to  other  governmental  departments  (usually  in  a 
form  that  concealed  the  source),  he  also  stuck  his  fingers  into  more  than  one 
political  pie.  Fortunately  for  Britain,  he  nearly  always  came  out  with 
plums. 

He  was  doing  this  even  before  Ewing  left.  There  was,  for  example,  the 
German  plan  for  a revolt  in  Persia,  bared  by  Room  40’s  cryptanalysis  of  the 
plotters’  messages.  In  another  case,  Trebitsch  Lincoln,  an  embittered  former 
member  of  Parliament,  sent  military  information  to  the  German  consul  in 
neutral  Rotterdam  in  one  dictionary  code  and  two  jargon  codes  that  were 
solved  by  Room  40.  In  one  of  the  jargon  systems,  family  names  meant  ships 
or  ports;  in  the  other,  various  petroleum  products  stood  for  them.  A message 
that  read  cable  prices  five  consignments  vaseline,  eight  paraffin  really 
meant  [At]  Dover  [are]  five  first-class  cruisers,  eight  sea-going  destroyers. 
Lincoln,  unfortunately,  evaded  the  British  authorities  and  escaped  to  New 
York.

Room  40  also  read  coded  messages  involving  Sir  Roger  Casement,  the 
former  British  consul  who,  after  failing  to  recruit  an  anti-English  battalion 
among  Irish  prisoners-of-war  in  Germany,  sought  to  raise  rebellion  in  Ireland. 
Several  of  these  cryptograms  were  passed  between  Berlin  and  German 
diplomatic  posts  in  the  United  States.  One  urged  German  military  support 
of  the  rebellion  by  “troops,  arms,  and  ammunition”;  another  dealt  with  the 
transmission  of  $500  to  Casement  by  John  Devoy,  an  Irish  agitator  in  America 
who  had  arranged  for  Germany’s  delivery  of  20,000  rifles  and  ten  machine 
guns  for  the  uprising.  Another  message  read  by  Room  40  reported  to  Devoy 
that  Casement’s  sailing  on  a submarine  was  imminent  and  arranged  that  the

codeword  oats  would  be  cabled  if  the  U-boat  left  with  Casement  aboard  as 
scheduled  and  the  codeword  hay  if  there  was  a hitch.  On  April  12,  1916, 
among  the  day’s  usual  batch  of  intercepts  appeared  one  containing  the  word 
oats.  Ten  days  later,  Casement  landed  near  Tralee  Bay — and  was  promptly 
arrested  by  waiting  authorities.  He  remained  cool,  giving  a false  name  and 
saying  he  was  a writer,  but  on  the  way  to  Adfert  Barracks  he  tried  to  discard 
a piece  of  paper  on  which  was  written  a small  code  of  phrases  he  might  need, 
such  as  send  more  explosives.  The  police  saw  it  and  confiscated  it  for  evidence. 
He  was  tried  and  convicted  of  high  treason.  Hall  deflated  the  strong  public 
pressure  for  a reprieve  by  surreptitiously  circulating  through  London  clubs 
and  the  House  of  Commons  specimen  pages  of  Casement’s  homosexually- 
inclined  "Black  Diaries.”  Casement  was  hanged  on  August  3. 

Not  all  Hall’s  activities  were  so  nefarious.  Spy  scares  were  rampant,  so 
much  so  that  when  a bird  flew  up  from  near  where  a foreign-looking  individual 
stood,  a hysterical  bystander  called  police,  convinced  that  the  “alien  was 
sending  messages  to  the  enemy  by  homing  pigeon.  One  day  a self-described 
“code  expert”  from  the  London  financial  district  came  to  tell  Hall  that  he 


282 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


had  solved  secret  messages  relating  to  the  movement  of  troops  that  had  been 
concealed  as  personal  advertisements  in  newspapers.  The  head  of  naval  in- 
telligence listened  attentively  and  invited  him  to  return  when  he  had  further 
proofs.  Then  Hall,  who  was  not  without  a sense  of  humor,  composed  a sus- 
picious-sounding message  and  inserted  it  in  the  personal  column  of  The 
Times.  Next  day  the  expert  arrived,  highly  agitated,  with  a “solution”  that 
disclosed  that  certain  battleships  were  about  to  sail  from  the  naval  ports  of 
Chatham,  Portsmouth,  and  Plymouth.  His  reaction  when  Hall  told  him  what 
had  happened  is,  regrettably,  not  recorded. 

At  about  half-past  ten  on  the  morning  of  January  17,  1917,  the  Reverend 
William  Montgomery,  a thin,  gray-haired  scholar  of  the  early  church  fathers 
who  was  serving  as  a cryptanalyst  in  the  diplomatic  section  of  Room  40,  came 
to  tell  Hall  of  what  looked  like  an  important  message.  Montgomery’s  in- 
stincts were  right.  The  cryptogram  that  he  and  a youthful  colleague,  Nigel  de 
Grey,  had  partially  read  was  to  become  the  single  most  far-reaching  and  most 
important  solution  in  history. 

The  message  was  a long  one,  consisting  of  about  a thousand  numerical 
codegroups.  Dated  at  Berlin  January  16,  it  was  addressed  to  the  German 
ambassador  in  the  United  States,  Count  Johann  Heinrich  Andreas  von  Bern- 
storff,  and  the  two  cryptanalysts  recognized  that  it  was  encoded  in  a German 
diplomatic  code  known  as  0075,  upon  which  they  had  been  working  for  six 
months.  Room  40  knew  from  its  analyses  that  0075  was  one  of  a series  of 
two-part  codes  that  the  German  Foreign  Office  designated  by  two  zeros  and 
two  digits,  the  two  digits  always  showing  an  arithmetical  difference  of  2. 
Among  the  others,  some  of  which  Room  40  had  solved,  were  0097,  0086, 
which  was  used  for  German  missions  in  South  America,  0064,  used  between 
Berlin  and  Madrid  and  perhaps  elsewhere,  0053,  and  0042.  Code  0075  was  a 
new  code  that  the  German  Foreign  Office  had  first  distributed  in  July  of  1916 
to  German  missions  in  Vienna,  Sofia,  Constantinople,  Bucharest,  Copenhagen, 
Stockholm,  Bern,  Lugano,  The  Hague,  and  Oslo.  Somehow  the  British 
obtained  copies  of  enough  of  the  telegrams  in  this  code  to  enable  Mont- 
gomery and  de  Grey,  whose  assignment  it  probably  was,  to  make  a start  in 
breaking  it.  In  November,  Room  40  began  intercepting  messages  to  the 
German  embassy  in  the  United  States  in  the  same  code,  and  if  Hall  guessed 
that  the  code  and  the  keys  to  the  superencipherment  that  it  sometimes  used 
had  been  sent  across  the  Atlantic  on  the  second  voyage  of  the  cargo  U-boat 
Deutschland,  which  docked  at  New  London  on  November  1,  1916,  he  would 
have  been  right. 

Montgomery  and  de  Grey  could  read  only  parts  of  the  long  message.  But 
they  could  see  that  it  was  a double-decker,  consisting  of  Berlin’s  messages 
Nos.  157  and  158  to  Bernstorff.  They  could  read  the  signature  of  the  German 
Foreign  Minister,  Arthur  Zimmermann.  As  far  as  they  could  extricate  its 
sense  on  the  basis  of  their  partial  solution  of  0075,  the  second  message  read : 


Room  40 


283 


Most  secret  for  your  Excellency’s  personal  information  and  to  be  handed  on 
to  the  Imperial  Minister  in  (?  Mexico)  with  Telegram  No.  1 (...)  by  a safe  route. 

We  propose  to  begin  on  the  1st  February  unrestricted  submarine  warfare.  In 
doing  so,  however,  we  shall  endeavor  to  keep  America  neutral.  (?)  If  we  should 
not  (succeed  in  doing  so)  we  propose  to  ( ? Mexico)  an  alliance  upon  the  following 
basis: 

[joint]  conduct  of  the  war. 

[joint]  conclusion  of  peace. 

(...) 

Your  Excellency  should  for  the  present  inform  the  President  [of  Mexico] 
secretly  (?  that  we  expect)  war  with  the  U.S.A.  (possibly)  (.  . .)  (Japan)  and  at 
the  same  time  to  negotiate  between  us  and  Japan.  (Please  tell  the  President)  that 
(.  . .)  or  submarines  (.  . .)  will  compel  England  to  peace  in  a few  months. 

• Acknowledge  receipt.  Zimmermann. 

Montgomery  handed  this  fragmentary  solution  to  Hall,  who  stared  down  at 
the  phrases  that  seemed  to  jump  off  the  page  at  him:  “unrestricted  submarine 
warfare,”  “war  with  the  U.S.A.,”  “propose  ...  an  alliance.”  He  realized  at 
once  that  here  was  a weapon  of  enormous  potentiality.  He  urged  Montgomery 
to  hurry  the  solution,  ordered  all  copies  except  the  original  message  and  a 
single  solution  burned,  and,  without  a word  to  the  Foreign  Office,  sat  down 
by  himself  to  contemplate  the  situation. 

It  was  as  bleak  as  that  winter's  day.  The  war  that  everyone  had  expected 
would  last  only  a few  weeks  had  now  dragged  into  its  third  year.  Nor  was 
there  any  prospect  of  an  end.  France  had  expended  half  a million  lives  at 
Verdun  and  only  succeeded  in  restoring  the  battle  line  to  where  it  was  ten 
months  before.  England,  which  had  lost  60,000  men  at  the  Somme  in  a single 
day,  struggled  to  gain  a few  yards  of  shell-blasted  earth,  then  fell  back 
exhausted.  The  Hindenburg  line  remained  unbreached.  Rumania,  a new  ally, 
had  been  quickly  overrun,  and  Russia,  the  colossus  of  the  east,  was  virtually 
defeated.  The  stepped-up  U-boat  campaign  increased  the  economic  pressure 
on  the  Allies.  Worst  of  all,  despite  the  provocation  of  the  Lusitania  sinking 
and  despite  the  tug  of  ancient  common  ties,  the  United  States,  guided  by  a 
President  who  had  just  won  reelection  on  the  slogan  "He  kept  us  out  of  war,” 
remained  obstinately  neutral. 

Things  were  no  better  in  Germany.  Her  initial  offensive  had  stalled  at  the 
Marne  and  her  gray-coated  troops  had  been  locked  in  the  futile  trench 
slaughter  ever  since.  Civilians  were  living  on  potatoes — a result  of  the 
stranglehold  of  the  British  blockade.  Fifteen-year-olds  were  being  conscripted. 
Greece  and  Portugal  had  recently  entered  the  war  against  her.  Like  the  Allies, 
she  could  see  no  immediate  hope  for  victory. 

Except  one. 

Unleash  the  submarines,  the  generals  cried,  and  England  would  soon  be 
“gasping  in  the  reeds  like  a fish."  The  blockaders  would  become  the  blockaded. 
For  months  the  generals  had  hammered  away  on  this  theme,  and,  as  the  signs

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


of  exhaustion  multiplied,  they  finally  prevailed.  Foreign  Minister  Zimmer- 
mann,  who  had  long  opposed  the  idea,  fell  in  line.  But  this  big  jolly  bachelor, 
the  first  to  break  the  Junker  barrier  in  the  higher  regions  of  the  Kaiser's 
officialdom,  perceived  that  the  repeated  sinkings  of  American  vessels  would 
sooner  or  later  torpedo  American  neutrality,  and  he  bethought  himself  of  a 
scheme  to  counter  this  danger.  He  proposed  a military  alliance  with  Mexico, 
then  particularly  hostile  to  the  imperialistic  Norteamericanos  as  a result  of 
Pershing’s  punitive  expedition  into  Mexican  territory.  He  sweetened  the  pro- 
position with  an  offer  of  money  and  the  possibility  of  support  from  Japan, 
standing  at  America’s  back,  and  with  still  more  anti-Yankee  inducements. 

Unable  to  deal  through  the  Mexican  ambassador,  who  was  in  Switzer- 
land, Zimmermann  sent  his  proposal  to  his  minister  in  Mexico,  Heinrich  J.  F. 
von  Eckardt,  by  way  of  Washington.  To  ensure  that  it  would  get  there,  he 
routed  it  two  ways,  both  monitored  by  Britain.  The  cruise  of  Telconia  was 
paying  off. 

One  way  was  called  the  “Swedish  Roundabout”  by  the  British.  Sweden, 
which  was  neutral  in  favor  of  Germany,  had  since  early  in  the  war  helped  the 
German  Foreign  Office  get  messages  past  the  British  cable  blockade  by  send- 
ing them  as  her  own.  British  censorship  detected  this  practice.  When  Sweden 
complained  in  the  summer  of  1915  that  Britain  was  delaying  her  messages, 
Britain  informed  her  that  it  had  positive  knowledge  of  the  unneutral  practice. 
The  Swedish  government  admitted  this  and  promised  that  it  would  no  longer 
send  any  German  messages  to  Washington.  It  did  not.  Instead,  it  sent  them  to 
Buenos  Aires.  Here  they  were  transferred  from  Swedish  to  German  hands  and 
then  forwarded  to  Washington.  This  was  a circuitous  route  of  about  7,000 
miles,  half  of  them  in  flat  violation  of  the  prerogatives  of  a nonbelligerent. 

But  the  cable  from  Stockholm  to  South  America  touched  at  England. 
Germany  feared  that  British  censorship  might  recognize  the  German  code- 
groups in  the  Swedish  messages  and  would  stop  the  dispatches.  So  the  German 
Foreign  Office  disguised  the  codegroups  by  enciphering  them.  This  was  done 
with  Code  13040  in  messages  to  Latin  America  and  to  Washington.  Un- 
fortunately for  the  Germans,  the  superencipherment  did  not  obliterate  all 
traces  of  the  underlying  code,  which  employed  a distinctive  mixture  of  3-,  4-, 
and  5-digit  codegroups.  These  traces  aroused  the  suspicions  of  the  ever-alert 
Room  40;  it  resolved  the  superencipherment,  and  Code  13040  reappeared. 
Room  40  then  looked  closely  at  other  official  Swedish  messages.  Many  of 
them  proved  to  be  German  as  well;  concealed  under  one  superencipherment, 
for  example,  they  found  Code  0075.  But  this  time  England  entered  no  protest. 
Hall  perceived  that  it  was  more  advantageous  to  listen  to  what  the  Germans 
were  saying  than  to  stop  them  from  talking. 

The  second  route  that  Zimmermann  used  was  of  such  simplicity,  perfidy, 
and  barefaced  gall  that  it  probably  remains  unequaled  in  the  annals  of 
diplomacy.  It  had  its  inception  in  the  pompous  mind  of  Colonel  Edward  M. 
House,  President  Wilson’s  alter  ego  and  a major  exponent  of  personal 


Room  40

diplomacy.  On  one  of  his  missions  to  Europe  in  1915,  House  arranged  to  have 
coded  reports  from  the  embassies  cabled  directly  to  him,  bypassing  the  State 
Department.  When,  on  December  27,  1916,  Ambassador  Bernstorff  discussed 
a new  peace  attempt  by  Wilson  with  House,  he  pointed  out  that  the  chances 
would  be  improved  if  his  government  could  communicate  directly  with  Wilson 
through  House.  House  checked  with  the  President.  The  next  day  Wilson 
permitted  the  German  government  to  send  messages  in  its  own  code  between 
Washington  and  Berlin  under  American  diplomatic  auspices — an  arrange- 
ment that  was,  at  best,  simpleminded,  and  that,  furthermore,  contravened 
the  accepted  international  practice  of  requiring  the  messages  to  be  submitted 
in  clear  for  transmission  in  American  code. 

Germany  availed  herself  of  this  arrangement  to  make  America  seal  her 
own  doom  by  letters  she  herself  bore.  Under  the  aegis  of  American  sovereignty, 
Zimmermann  sent  his  message  striking  at  that  sovereignty.  It  was  delivered  to 
the  American  embassy  in  Berlin  at  3 p.m.  January  16.  It  could  not  go  direct 
to  Washington,  but  had  to  be  sent  first  to  Copenhagen — and  then  to  London. 
Only  from  there  could  it  go  to  Washington.  Consequently  Britain  seized  this 
copy  as  well.  Room  40  was  “highly  entertained”  at  the  sight  of  the  German 
code  in  an  American  cable,  but  again  did  not  protest. 

With  two  copies  of  the  same  text  helping  to  eliminate  garbles,  Mont- 
gomery and  de  Grey  rammed  into  the  cryptogram.  De  Grey,  though  at  30  the 
younger  of  the  two,  had  been  in  Room  40  the  longer.  Slightly  built,  rather 
handsome,  with  dark  hair  and  brown  eyes  and  chiseled,  movie-star  features, 
an  Eton  graduate,  he  was  descended  from  the  peerage  as  the  grandson  of  the 
fifth  Baron  Walsingham  (no  relation  to  Sir  Francis  Walsingham).  He  had 
worked  for  the  prestigious  publishing  house  of  William  Heinemann  for  seven 
years  before  the  war,  when  he  joined  the  Royal  Naval  Air  Service.  He  came 
to  Room  40  in  1915. 

Soon  after  his  work  on  the  cryptogram  that  became  known  as  the  Zimmer- 
mann telegram,  he  left  40  O.B.  to  serve  as  head  of  the  naval  intelligence  mis- 
sion that  Hall  had  sent  to  Rome.  After  the  war,  he  became  director  of  the 
Medici  Society,  a publishing  house  specializing  in  art  prints.  In  1939,  his 
government  remembered  his  World  War  I services,  and  he  joined  the  crypt- 
analytic  division  of  the  Foreign  Office,  soon  becoming  deputy  director.  A 
man  who  listed  as  his  recreations  the  odd  threesome  of  shooting,  gardening, 
and  acting,  he  also  enjoyed  carpentry  and  was  useful  around  the  house.  He 
died  May  25,  1951,  leaving  two  sons  and  a daughter. 

Montgomery  was  45  at  the  time  of  his  work  on  the  Zimmermann  telegram. 
A Liverpool  shipowner's  son  who  studied  in  private  schools  or  under  tutors 
in  England,  France,  and  Germany,  he  took  a bachelor  of  divinity  degree  at 
Presbyterian  College,  London.  But  his  health  prevented  an  active  pastorate 
and  he  became  a member  of  St.  John’s  College  at  Cambridge  University.  He 
specialized  in  early  church  history,  editing  the  Confessions  of  St.  Augustine 
for  the  Cambridge  Patristic  Series  and  writing  a study  on  the  life  and  thought

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


of  the  African  father.  His  most  memorable  work,  however,  was  as  a translator. 
It  was  said  of  his  translation  of  Albert  Schweitzer’s  The  Quest  of  the  Historical 
Jesus  in  1910  that  “no  German  work  has  ever  been  rendered  into  English  so 
idiomatically  and  yet  so  faithfully.”  A modest,  reticent  man,  Montgomery 
entered  the  censor’s  office  in  1916,  and  later  that  year  transferred  to  Room 
40.  Cryptanalysis  so  suited  his  aptitudes  that  after  the  war  he  continued  the 
work  in  the  Foreign  Office,  remaining  there  until  his  sudden  death  in  October, 
1930. 

While  in  Room  40  his  familiarity  with  Scripture  unriddled  a problem  that 
had  baffled  most  of  the  other  staffers.  A Sir  Henry  Jones  had  received  a blank 
postcard  from  Turkey  addressed  to  him  at  184  King’s  Road,  Tighnabruaich, 
Scotland.  Sir  Henry  knew  that  the  card  was  from  his  son,  who  had  been  cap- 
tured by  the  Turks,  but  Tighnabruaich  is  a small  village,  with  no  King’s  Road 
and  so  few  houses  that  no  number  would  have  been  needed  in  any  case.  The 
card  found  its  way  to  Room  40,  where'nobody  seemed  able  to  ascertain  what 
Sir  Henry’s  son  was  trying  to  tell  him.  Finally  Montgomery  suggested  a 
reference  to  chapter  18,  verse  4,  of  one  of  the  books  of  Kings.  Second  Kings 
shed  no  light,  but  First  Kings  revealed  that  “Obadiah  took  a hundred 
prophets,  and  hid  them  fifty  in  a cave,  and  fed  them  with  bread  and  water.” 
Montgomery  interpreted  this  to  mean  that  Sir  Henry’s  son  was  safe  with 
other  prisoners  but  in  need  of  food — and  this  proved  to  be  the  case. 

But  the  solution  of  the  Zimmermann  telegram  required  more  than  a flash 
of  inspiration.  It  demanded  the  reconstruction  of  Code  0075,  a two-part  code 
of  10,000  words  and  phrases  numbered  from  0000  to  9999  in  mixed  order. 
Since  a code  is,  in  a sense,  a gigantic  mon  alphabetic  substitution,  the  estab- 
lishment of  plaintext  equivalents  is  the  “only”  task  involved.  But  where  the 
cryptanalyst  of  cipher  deals  with  only  26  such  elements,  the  cryptanalyst  of 
code  must  keep  his  eye  on  hundreds  or  thousands,  whose  characteristics, 
moreover,  because  of  their  reduced  frequency,  are  much  scantier  and  more 
diffuse  than  the  sharply  defined  traits  of  letters. 

Solution  usually  begins  with  the  identification  of  the  groups  meaning 
stop.  Groups  that  recur  near  the  end  of  telegrams  are  likely  candidates.  The 
identification  of  stop  or  period  is  often  aided  because  often  only  a few  of  the 
many  code  equivalents  are  employed.  Code  clerks,  referring  frequently  to 
stop,  come  to  memorize  one  or  two  of  its  codegroups;  they  then  simply  use 
these  groups  in  encoding  instead  of  hunting  up  a different  one  in  the  codebook. 
Indeed,  cryptanalysts  familiar  with  a given  embassy’s  messages  can  often  tell 
when  a new  code  clerk  has  been  hired  by  the  sudden  efflorescence  of  new 
equivalents  for  stop\ 

The  identification  of  the  stops  outlines  the  structure  of  the  message.  In 
English  messages,  nouns,  as  the  subjects  of  sentences,  will  often  appear  directly 
after  stops.  In  German,  where  the  predicate  often  comes  at  the  end  of  the 
sentence,  the  codegroup  immediately  preceding  a stop  may  be  a verb.  Other 
clues  come  from  the  stereotyped  expressions  that  diplomats  so  love  in  their 


Room  40  287 

dispatches:  “I  have  the  honor  to  report  to  Your  Excellency.  . . .”  Collateral 
information  is  of  very  great  value. 

The  first  tentative  identifications  are  usually  written  in  pencil  for  easy 
erasing,  and  such  are  called  “pencil  groups.”  Eventually,  further  traffic  con- 
firms them  and  they  become  “ink  groups.”  Solution  proceeds  much  more 
rapidly  if  a code  is  one-part.  If  codegroup  1234  represents  a word  beginning 
with  d,  then  5678  must  represent  one  farther  back  in  the  alphabet ; this  both 
rules  out  some  guesses  and  suggests  others.  Sometimes  the  meaning  of  a 
codegroup  can  be  indicated  rather  precisely  by  its  location  between  two  ink 
groups.  This  is  not  possible  with  a two-part  code,  where  the  code  and  plain 
equivalents  are  matched  in  an  absolutely  arbitrary  fashion.  Code  0075  was  of 
this  type.  It  required  more  traffic  for  its  solution  than  a one-part  code,  and 
the  identifications  came  more  slowly  and  with  greater  difficulty.  It  had  been 
in  service  on  the  Continent  for  only  half  a year— not  a very  long  time  for  a 
diplomatic  code— and  portions  of  many  messages  remained  unreadable. 

As  more  traffic  came  in  (including  now  the  messages  to  and  from  Bern- 
storff),  Montgomery  and  de  Grey,  working  night  and  day,  filled  in  more  and 
more  groups,  ever  more  rapidly.  On  January  28,  de  Grey  brought  Hall  part 
of  Bernstorff’s  protest  against  Zimmermann’s  plan  of  unrestricted  submarine 
warfare,  which,  to  the  ambassador’s  dismay,  had  been  announced  to  him  in 
message  No.  157,  the  first  part  of  the  double-decker.  Bernstorff  argued 
vigorously  against  this  plan,  for  he  felt  that  it  negated  all  his  efforts  to  bring 
about  a detente  between  the  two  countries  and  that  it  would  drive  the  United 
States  into  the  war  on  the  side  of  the  Allies. 

And  in  fact,  on  February  3 Wilson  announced  to  Congress  that  he  was 
breaking  diplomatic  relations  with  Germany,  as  he  had  said  he  would  the 
previous  April  if  Germany  continued  its  course  of  submarine  warfare.  Though 
he  added  that  “only  actual  overt  acts”  on  Germany’s  part  would  make  him 
believe  that  she  really  would  sink  neutral  vessels  on  the  high  seas,  it  must  have 
seemed  to  the  war-weary  Allies  that  now,  at  last,  within  a few  days  or  a fort- 
night at  most,  the  United  States  would  enter  the  war.  Day  by  day,  they 
awaited  the  final  inevitable  step. 

While  waiting,  Room  40  continued  its  work  on  Code  0075.  De  Grey  had 
taken  to  Hall  Bernstorff’s  message  giving  details  of  his  interview  with  Wilson 
severing  relations.  Recovered  codegroups  were  substituted  into  the  Zimmer- 
mann telegram,  and  on  February  5 Hall  was  able  to  show  a more  fully  solved 
version  of  it  to  Ford  Hardinge  at  the  Foreign  Office. 

Hall  had  realized  from  the  first  day  that  Montgomery  had  brought  him 
the  first  sketchy  solution  of  the  Zimmermann  telegram  that  he  had  in  it  a 
propaganda  weapon  of  titanic  proportions.  Exposure  of  this  German  plot 
directed  against  the  United  States  would,  in  the  present  circumstances, 
almost  certainly  compel  that  nation  to  declare  war  on  Germany.  This  was  an 
immensely  strong  argument  for  showing  it  to  the  Americans.  But  for  the 
moment,  at  least,  even  stronger  considerations  militated  against  it.  First,  Room

40  and  its  cryptanalytic  capabilities  was  one  of  Britain’s  darkest  secrets.  How 
could  she  disclose  the  message  without  Germany’s  guessing  that  her  codes  were 
being  read?  Britain  might  minimize  the  risk  by  hinting  that  the  plaintext  had 
been  stolen,  but  the  danger  would  still  remain  that  Germany  would  suspect 
the  truth,  change  her  codes,  and  deprive  Britain  of  her  most  valuable  intelli- 
gence. In  the  second  place,  to  reveal  the  message,  Britain  would  have  to  admit 
that  it  had  been  supervising  the  code  telegrams  of  a neutral:  Sweden.  It  would 
not  require  much  wit  for  the  Americans  to  surmise  that  England  might  also 
be  supervising  the  code  telegrams  of  another  neutral:  the  United  States, 
which,  like  Sweden,  was  working  as  a messenger  boy  for  the  Germans  and 
had,  in  fact,  transmitted  this  very  message.  This  realization  would  both  em- 
barrass and  anger  the  United  States  and  would  not  conduce  to  pro-Allied 
feelings.  In  the  third  place,  the  solution  was  still  not  complete.  The  missing 
portions  would  inevitably  raise  doubts  about  the  validity  of  the  solution  and 
so  weaken  its  impact.  Perhaps  the  British  had  failed  to  solve  a word  like  “not” 
that  would  completely  alter  the  sense,  the  arguments  would  run.  Perhaps  the 
British  had  not  even  correctly  solved  the  portion  that  they  were  offering  as 
evidence  of  German  duplicity.  Moreover,  the  gaps  would  shout  “code- 
breaking,”  preventing  any  subterfuges  about  captured  codes  or  a stolen 
message  and  exposing  the  very  secret  Britain  sought  to  conceal. 

But  the  most  powerful  argument  against  disclosure  of  the  German  plot, 
with  all  the  attendant  difficulties,  was  that  events  might  make  it  unnecessary. 
Relations  had  been  severed  between  Germany  and  the  United  States.  Ameri- 
can public  opinion  seemed  to  be  turning  increasingly  against  Germany. 
Shipping  dared  not  sail;  ports  were  congested;  men  were  laid  off;  business 
languished.  Bitterness  was  growing.  It  seemed  only  a matter  of  a short  while 
until  the  declaration  of  war.  And  so  the  British  continued  to  wait,  and  to  hope. 

Hall,  however,  while  waiting  for  events  to  dictate,  did  not  remain  idle.  His 
job  was  only  half  done  if  he  merely  solved  the  Zimmermann  telegram  without 
making  it  ready  for  use  by  his  government.  Consequently,  he  conceived  a plan 
that  at  one  stroke  might  resolve  the  three  difficulties  connected  with  the 
telegram’s  exposure,  in  what  still  appeared  the  unlikely  event  that  that  might 
be  necessary.  He  reasoned  that  the  telegram  as  received  in  Mexico  would 
differ  in  small  but  significant  details  from  the  telegram  as  sent  from  Berlin. 
The  date  would  almost  certainly  be  different,  and  probably  the  serial  number 
as  well.  The  preamble  addressed  to  Bernstorff  ordering  him  to  forward  the 
message  would  of  course  be  omitted.  If  Hall  could  produce  the  copy  from 
Mexico,  perhaps  the  Germans  would  spot  these  slight  variations  and  infer  that 
the  plaintext  had  been  betrayed  on  the  American  continent  and  would  not 
change  their  codes.  Other  collateral  details  might  confirm  a tale  of  a Mexican 
theft  to  the  Americans.  Moreover,  Room  40  perhaps  knew,  from  its  numerous 
solutions  of  German  messages  via  the  Swedish  roundabout,  that  the  German 
mission  in  Mexico  had  not  used  Code  0075  and  probably  did  not  hold  it. 
Bernstorff  might  then  have  had  to  re-encode  the  Zimmermann  telegram  in 


Room  40 


289 


another  code,  which  Room  40  might  have  solved  more  completely  than 
0075  and  which  might  therefore  enable  it  to  fill  in  the  missing  portions  in 
its  solution. 

On  February  5,  therefore,  Hall  began  trying  to  get  a copy  of  the  Zimmer- 
mann telegram  as  received  in  Mexico.  An  English  agent  known  only  as  T 
obtained  from  the  Mexico  City  telegraph  office  a copy  of  the  message  that 
Bernstorff  had  sent  to  Eckardt  by  Western  Union.  Soon  Hall  had  it. 

It  proved  him  right  in  every  one  of  his  assumptions.  Eckardt  did  not  have 
Code  0075,  and  so  Bernstorff  had  had  to  recode  the  dispatch  in  one  that 
Eckardt  did  have.  This  was  Code  13040,  which  was  an  older  and  simpler 
code  than  0075  and  whose  superencipherment  had  led  to  the  discovery  of  the 
Swedish  roundabout.  It  had  been  distributed  to  German  missions  in  Central 
and  South  America  between  1907  and  1909  and  to  Washington,  New  York, 
Havana,  Port-au-Prince,  and  La  Paz  in  1912.  Its  basic  repertory  contained 
about  25,000  plaintext  elements  with  a fair  number  of  homophones— Bern- 
storff’s  telegram  alone  employed  six  different  groups  for  zu — and  proper 
names  took  up  a huge  section  of  75,000  codenumbers.  But  Code  13040  was  a 
cross  between  one-part  and  two-part  codes.  In  the  encoding  section,  blocks 
of  several  hundred  codenumbers  in  numerical  order  stood  opposite  the 
alphabetized  plaintext  elements,  but  the  blocks  themselves  were  in  mixed 
order.  A skeleton  code,  made  up  from  a few  groups  from  Bernstorff’s  en- 
coding, will  illustrate  this:

The  solution  of  such  a hybrid  code  stands  midway  in  difficulty  between  the 
two  pure  types:  harder  than  a one-part  code  but  easier  than  a two-part.  The 
large  orderly  segments  considerably  help  the  cryptanalyst,  though  his  guesses 
are  not  as  delimited  as  in  a one-part  code.  For  example,  the  cryptanalyst 
could  not  assume,  as  he  could  in  a one-part  solution,  that  a codegroup  for 
Krieg  will  be  higher  in  number  than  the  codegroup  for  Februar.  But  if  he 
knows  that  Februar  is  13605  and  finanzielle  is  13850,  he  will  know  that  the 
codegroup  for  fest  must  almost  certainly  fall  somewhere  between  the  two. 
His  identifications  thus  come  with  greater  speed  and  certainty.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Owing  to  this  weakness,  and  to  the  fact  that  they  had  had  all  of  the  war  to 
work  on  a great  volume  of  messages,  the  codebreakers  of  Room  40  had  re- 
covered most  of  Code  13040’s  commonly  used  groups.  They  could  co*.’e-

The  Zimmermann  telegram  as  re-encoded  in  Washington  into  Code  13040  and 
forwarded  to  Mexico 


quently  read  all  or  nearly  all  of  Bernstorff’s  message  to  Eckardt,  and  in  those 
few  places  where  a rare  proper  name  or  syllable  might  have  been  used  for  the 
first  time,  the  partial  alphabetical  arrangement  afforded  a strong  check  on

their  guesses.  This  eliminated  the  problem  of  having  only  a partial  solution. 
In  addition,  it  confirmed  their  almost-complete  solution  of  the  original 
Berlin-to-Washington  message  and  added  a few  new  values  to  their  recon- 
struction of  Code  0075. 

The  cryptanalysts  also  found  the  slight  changes  in  heading  that  Hall  had 
foreseen.  BernstorfT  had  deleted  the  Foreign  Office  preamble  and  substituted 
one  of  his  own:  “Foreign  Office  telegraphs  January  16:  No.  1.  Most  Secret. 
Decode  yourself.’’  He  replaced  the  Berlin-Washington  serial  number  with  a 
Washington-Mexico  City  serial  number,  which  was  3.  And  finally,  his  mes- 
sage was  dated  January  19,  which,  due  to  the  numerous  steps  in  the  com- 
plicated transmission  routes,  differed  from  the  January  16  date  that  the 
original  German  text  bore. 

Fairly  early  in  February,  it  seems,  Hall  was  ready.  With  a stroke  bordering 
on  genius,  he  had  done  his  job.  His  must  stand  as  one  of  the  most  subtly  dis- 
sembling moves  in  the  whole  history  of  espionage.  It  was  now  possible  to  give 
the  message  to  the  Americans,  should  that  prove  necessary,  with  as  little  risk 
as  possible  to  Britain’s  intelligence  sources.  But  though  Hall  had  covered  his 
tracks  fairly  well,  it  remained  possible  that  the  Germans  might  guess  the 
truth.  Events  might  yet  make  it  unnecessary  to  chance  this.  So  Britain  held  the 
message  and  waited. 

And  waited.  The  days  passed.  On  the  Western  Front  the  lifeblood  of  the 
Empire  and  of  the  French  republic  trickled  into  the  earth.  The  armies  shud- 
dered in  mortal  combat.  Still  there  came  no  sign  that  America  was  going  to 
enter  the  war.  Though  it  seemed  that  Germany’s  announcement  of  unrestric- 
ted torpedoings  of  American  ships  had  made,  as  BernstorfT  himself  had 
warned  in  cables  read  by  Room  40,  “war  unavoidable,”  the  American 
President  seemed  unable  to  do  what  the  British  thought  that  honor,  self- 
respect,  and  the  whole  course  of  recent  actions  made  obligatory.  Even 
Ambassador  Page,  a long-time  friend  of  the  President  and  a wholehearted 
sympathizer  with  the  Allied  cause,  was  irked  enough  to  note  in  his  diary, 
“The  danger  is  that  with  all  the  authority  he  wants  (short  of  a formal  declara- 
tion of  war)  the  President  will  again  wait,  wait,  wait — till  an  American 
liner  be  torpedoed!  Or  till  an  attack  is  made  on  our  coast  by  a German 
submarine!”  Evidently  Wilson  was  waiting  for  the  “overt  acts”  that  he 
had  mentioned  in  his  address  to  Congress.  But  perhaps  Germany  would 
not  actually  be  so  rash  as  to  torpedo  American  ships  and  thereby — Britain 
thought — cut  her  own  throat.  More  days  passed.  The  Germans  did 
nothing.  Tension  mounted.  The  situation  was,  a British  diplomat  in  America 
reported,  “much  that  of  a soda-water  bottle  with  the  wires  cut  but  the  cork 
unexploded.” 

It  exploded  on  February  22,  1917.  Unable  to  wait  any  longer,  the  British 
gave  the  cork  a push.  Hall,  with  Foreign  Office  approval  if  not  under 
its  orders,  showed  the  Zimmermann  telegram  to  Edward  Bell,  a secre- 
tary of  the  American  embassy  who  maintained  liaison  with  the  various

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


intelligence  offices  of  the  British  government.  He  read  an  astounding  tale  of 
German  intrigue  against  his  country: 

We  intend  to  begin  on  the  first  of  February  unrestricted  submarine  warfare. 
We  shall  endeavor  in  spite  of  this  to  keep  the  United  States  of  America  neutral. 
In  the  event  of  this  not  succeeding,  we  make  Mexico  a proposal  of  alliance  on 
the  following  basis : 

Make  war  together,  make  peace  together,  generous  financial  support,  and  an 
understanding  on  our  part  that  Mexico  is  to  reconquer  the  lost  territory  in  Texas, 
New  Mexico  and  Arizona.  The  settlement  in  detail  is  left  to  you. 

You  will  inform  the  President  [of  Mexico]  of  the  above  most  secretly,  as  soon 
as  the  outbreak  of  war  with  the  United  States  of  America  is  certain  and  add  the 
suggestion  that  he  should,  on  his  own  initiative,  invite  Japan  to  immediate 
adherence  and  at  the  same  time  mediate  between  Japan  and  ourselves. 

Please  call  the  President’s  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  ruthless  employment 
of  our  submarines  now  offers  the  prospect  of  compelling  England  in  a few 
months  to  make  peace. 

Zimmermann. 

Bell  did  not  believe  it.  The  notion  that  anyone  in  his  right  mind  would 
consider  giving  away  a chunk  of  the  continental  United  States  was  simply  too 
preposterous.  But  Hall  convinced  him  of  its  authenticity,  and  the  two  went 
over  to  Grosvenor  Square.  When  Page  saw  the  message,  he  realized  at  once 
that  the  entry  into  war  on  England’s  side,  which  he  had  so  single-mindedly 
pursued  and  the  President  had  so  obstinately  opposed,  was  at  last  delivered 
into  his  hands.  Hall,  Bell,  Page,  and  Irwin  Laughlin,  first  secretary  of  the 
embassy,  spent  the  day  trying  to  decide  how  best  to  instill  confidence  in  the 
telegram’s  genuineness,  to  minimize  incredulity,  and  to  maximize  its  impact. 
They  decided  that  the  British  government  should  officially  present  the  telegram 
to  Page,  and  in  his  room  at  the  Foreign  Office  the  next  day  Arthur  Balfour, 
now  secretary  of  state  for  foreign  affairs,  formally  communicated  it  to  Page 
in  a moment  that  Balfour  later  confessed  was  “as  dramatic  a moment  as  I 
remember  in  all  my  life.” 

Page  worked  all  night  to  draft  a covering  message  explaining  how  the 
telegram  was  obtained.  At  2 a.m.  February  24  he  cabled,  “In  about  three 
hours  I shall  send  a telegram  of  great  importance  to  the  President  and 
Secretary  of  State,”  but  it  was  not  until  1 p.m.  that  the  Zimmermann  telegram, 
with  his  explanation,  was  transmitted.  He  gave  the  President  the  collection  of 
half-truths  that  Hall  had  given  him — for  Hall  naturally  withheld  the  deep 
secret  of  British  cryptanalytic  ability,  particularly  since  it  might  start  the 
Americans  wondering  whether  Britain  was  reading  their  code  messages  as 
well : 


Early  in  the  war  the  British  government  obtained  possession  of  a copy  of  the 
German  cipher  code  used  in  the  above  message  and  have  made  it  their  business 
to  obtain  copies  of  Bernstorff’s  cipher  telegrams  to  Mexico,  among  others,  which 


Room  40 


293 


are  sent  back  to  London  and  deciphered  here.  This  accounts  for  their  being  able 
to  decipher  this  telegram  from  the  German  government  to  their  representative 
in  Mexico,  and  also  for  the  delay  from  January  19th  until  now  in  their  receiving 
the  information.  This  system  has  hitherto  been  a jealously  guarded  secret  and  is 
only  divulged  to  you  now  by  the  British  government  in  view  of  the  extra- 
ordinary circumstances  and  their  friendly  feeling  toward  the  United  States.  They 
earnestly  request  that  you  will  keep  the  source  of  your  information  and  the 
British  government’s  method  of  obtaining  it  profoundly  secret,  but  they  put  no 
prohibition  on  the  publication  of  Zimmermann’s  telegram  itself. 

Page’s  pilot  telegram  rattled  the  Morse  sounders  at  the  State  Department 
at  9 a.m.  Saturday,  February  24,  but  the  “telegram  of  great  importance”  did 
not  arrive  until  8:30  that  evening.  Frank  L.  Polk,  counselor  of  the  depart- 
ment and  acting  secretary  in  the  absence  of  Secretary  of  State  Robert  L. 
Lansing,  telephoned  to  ask  the  President  to  expect  him  and  carried  the  four 
typewritten  yellow  sheets  across  the  street  to  the  White  House.  Wilson,  Polk 
reported,  showed  “much  indignation”  on  reading  it,  and  wanted  to  make  it 
public  at  once.  But  he  agreed  to  Polk’s  suggestion  to  await  Lansing’s  return 
from  a long  weekend. 

On  Tuesday,  February  27,  Lansing  came  back  from  White  Sulphur 
Springs.  Polk  told  him  about  the  Zimmermann  telegram  and  showed  him  an 
exceptionally  long  cable  of  1,000  codegroups  that  he  had  found  in  the  State 
Department  files.  It  had  come  for  Bernstorff  in  an  American  cablegram  of 
January  17  from  Berlin  and  was,  Polk  felt,  almost  certainly  the  coded  original. 
(It  was,  in  fact,  the  double-decker,  which  included  the  Zimmermann  tele- 
gram.) At  1 1 that  morning,  Lansing,  armed  with  this,  discussed  the  whole 
situation  with  the  President,  who  exclaimed  “Good  Lord!”  several  times  at 
the  outrageous  German  abuse  of  the  cable  privileges  he  had  extended  them. 
He  consented  to  Lansing's  plan  to  release  the  telegram  through  the  press, 
which  Lansing  felt  “would  avoid  any  charge  of  using  the  document  im- 
properly and  would  attract  more  attention  than  issuing  it  openly.”  Ac- 
cordingly, at  6 p.m.  the  next  day,  E.  M.  Hood  of  the  Associated  Press  was 
called  to  Lansing’s  home,  given  the  message  and  some  background  details, 
and  pledged  to  secrecy  on  the  greatest  scoop  of  the  war. 

The  story  broke  in  eight-column  streamers  in  the  morning  papers  of 
March  1.  “Profound  sensation,”  Lansing  noted.  The  nation  gasped.  In  Con- 
gress, the  House  orated  patriotically  and  passed  by  403  to  13  a bill  to  arm 
merchant  ships.  But  the  Senate,  more  deliberate,  wondered  whether  the  whole 
thing  was  not  just  a crude  Allied  plot.  This  reaction  had  been  foreseen. 
Lansing  had  asked  Page  to  “Please  endeavor  to  obtain  copy  of  German  code 
from  Mr.  Balfour,”  but  the  British  had  told  him  that  the  code  was  “never 
used  straight,  but  with  a great  number  of  variations  which  are  known  to  only 
one  or  two  experts  here.  They  can  not  be  spared  to  go  to  America."  This  was, 
of  course,  another  half-truth — the  0075  message  was  probably  superenciph- 
ered  (the  “variations”)  but  the  13040  one  was  not.  Polk,  meanwhile,  exerted 


294 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

tremendous  pressure  on  Newcomb  Carlton,  the  president  of  Western  Union, 
and  finally  managed  to  get  a copy  of  Bernstorff’s  telegram  to  Eckardt  despite 
a federal  law  protecting  the  privacy  of  telegrams.  Lansing  appended  this  code- 
text to  the  wire  he  sent  Page  at  8 p.m.  the  day  of  the  expose: 

Some  members  of  Congress  are  attempting  to  discredit  Zimmermann  message 
charging  that  message  was  furnished  to  this  government  by  one  of  the  belliger- 
ents. This  government  has  not  the  slightest  doubt  as  to  its  authenticity  but  it 
would  be  of  the  greatest  service  if  the  British  government  would  permit  you  or 
someone  in  the  Embassy  to  personally  decode  the  original  message  which  we 
secured  from  the  telegraph  office  in  Washington,  and  then  cable  to  Department 
German  text.  Assure  Mr.  Balfour  that  the  Department  hesitated  to  make  this 
request  but  feels  that  this  course  will  materially  strengthen  its  position  and  make 
it  possible  for  the  Department  to  state  that  it  had  secured  the  Zimmermann  note 
from  our  own  people. 

The  message,  No.  4494,  was  received  the  next  day,  and  by  4 p.m.  Page 
cabled  back:  “Bell  took  the  cipher  text  of  the  German  messages  contained 
in  your  4494  of  yesterday  to  the  Admiralty  and  there,  himself,  deciphered  it 
from  the  German  code  which  is  in  the  Admiralty’s  possession.”  In  fact  Bell 
wrote  only  a dozen  or  so  plaintext  groups  before  letting  de  Grey  do  the  rest 
in  his  neat  handwriting.  Page  then  sent  the  German  text  as  decoded  by  Bell 
and  de  Grey.  But  Lansing  and  the  President  had  already  sent  up  to  the 
Senate  a statement  that  the  government  possessed  evidence  establishing  the 
telegram  as  genuine,  and  that  no  further  information  could  be  disclosed. 

Everyone  already  had  his  own  pet  theory  of  how  the  United  States  had 
gotten  it.  Most  popular  was  the  spy  story.  Most  farfetched  was  that  four  Ameri- 
can soldiers  had  found  it  on  a German  agent  trying  to  cross  into  Mexico.  Most 
plausible  was  that  the  telegram  had  been  found  among  Bernstorff’s  effects 
when  his  baggage  was  searched  at  Halifax  after  his  dismissal.  Most  amusing 
were  the  attacks  by  the  British  press  on  the  inefficiency  of  their  secret  service 
and  its  inferiority  to  the  American.  (At  least  one  of  these  was  instigated  by 
Hall  himself  to  throw  the  theorizers  off  the  scent.) 

Wilhelmstrasse,  too,  wondered  where  the  leak  had  occurred.  Though  the 
message  as  published  in  the  papers  did  not  carry  either  Bernstorlf's  heading  or 
his  serial  number,  it  did  bear  the  significant  date  January  19.  “Please  cable  in 
same  cipher,”  the  Loreign  Office  purred  at  a quivering  Eckardt,  who  had 
already  tried  to  blame  Bernstorff  for  the  betrayal,  “who  deciphered  cable 
dispatches  1 [the  Zimmermann  telegram]  and  11  [ordering  Eckardt  to 
negotiate  at  once  for  the  proposed  alliance],  how  the  originals  and  decodes 
were  kept,  and,  in  particular,  whether  both  dispatches  were  kept  in  the  same 
place.”  Six  days  later,  it  picked  up  the  clue  that  Hall  had  carefully  planted: 
“Various  indications  suggest  that  the  treachery  was  committed  in  Mexico. 
The  greatest  caution  is  indicated.  Burn  all  compromising  material.” 

Eckardt  mustered  impressive  details  to  exculpate  himself:  “Both  dis- 
patches were  deciphered,  in  accordance  with  my  special  instructions,  by  [Dr.

German-speaking  servant,  the  Foreign  Office  capitulated.  “After  your  tele- 
gram it  is  hardly  conceivable  that  betrayal  took  place  in  Mexico.  In  face  of  it 
the  indications  which  point  in  that  direction  lose  their  force.  No  blame  rests 
on  either  you  or  Magnus.”

Meanwhile,  the  problem  of  authenticity,  which  had  so  troubled  the  Anglo- 
American  officials  and  stirred  uneasy  questioning  in  the  Senate  and  the  press, 
had  been  eliminated  by  Zimmermann  himself.  Completely  unexpectedly,  he 
confessed:  “I  cannot  deny  it.  It  is  true.”  Knowledge  of  the  plot  had  been 
blandly  disavowed  by  the  Mexicans,  the  Japanese,  and  Eckardt,  and  to  this 
day  no  one  knows  why  Zimmermann  admitted  it.  His  acknowledgment 
buried  the  last  doubts  that  the  story  might  have  been  a hoax. 

Suddenly,  Americans  in  the  middle  of  the  continent  who  could  not  get 
excited  about  the  distant  poppings  of  a European  war  jerked  awake  in  the 
realization  that  the  war  was  at  their  border.  Texans  blinked  in  astonishment: 
the  Germans  meant  to  give  away  their  state!  The  Midwest,  unmoved  because 
untouched  by  the  submarine  issue,  imagined  a German-officered  army 
crossing  the  Rio  Grande  and  swung  over  to  the  side  of  the  Allies.  The  Far 
West  blew  up  like  a land  mine  at  the  mention  of  Japan.  Within  a month, 
public  opinion  crystallized.  Wilson,  who  three  months  before  had  said  that 
it  would  be  a “crime  against  civilization”  to  lead  the  nation  into  war,  de- 
cided that  “the  right  is  more  precious  than  peace”  and  went  up  to  Capitol 
Hill  on  April  2 to  ask  Congress  to  help  make  the  world  safe  for  democracy. 
He  cited  the  Zimmermann  telegram  in  his  address: 

“That  it  [the  German  government]  means  to  stir  up  enemies  against  us  at 
our  very  doors,  the  intercepted  note  to  the  German  minister  at  Mexico  City 
is  eloquent  evidence.  We  are  accepting  this  challenge  of  hostile  purpose.  ...  I 
advise  that  the  Congress  declare  the  recent  course  of  the  Imperial  German 
Government  to  be  in  fact  nothing  less  than  war  against  the  government  and 
people  of  the  United  States,  that  it  formally  accept  the  status  of  belligerent 
which  has  thus  been  thrust  upon  it.” 

The  Congress  did.  Soon  the  Yanks  were  coming.  The  fresh  strength  of  the 
young  nation  poured  into  the  trenches  of  the  Western  Front  to  rescue  the 
exhausted  Allies.  And  so  it  came  about  that  Room  40’s  solution  of  an  enemy 
message  helped  propel  the  United  States  into  the  First  World  War,  enabling 
the  Allies  to  win,  and  into  world  leadership,  with  all  that  that  has  entailed. 
No  other  single  cryptanalysis  has  had  such  enormous  consequences.  Never 
before  or  since  has  so  much  turned  upon  the  solution  of  a secret  message. 
For  those  few  moments  in  time,  the  codebreakers  held  history  in  the  palm  of 
their  hand.

A WAR  OF  INTERCEPTS:  I 


radio,  envisioned  by  its  inventor  as  a great  humanitarian  contribution,  was 
seized  upon  by  the  generals  soon  after  its  birth  in  1895  and  impressed  as  an 
instrument  of  war.  For  it  immeasurably  magnified  the  chief  military  advan- 
tage of  telegraphy : instantaneous  and  continuous  control  of  an  entire  army 
by  a single  commander.  By  eliminating  the  need  for  physical  linkage  by  wire, 
radio  speeded  communication  between  headquarters,  joined  through  the 
ether  units  that  could  not  connect  by  wire  because  of  distance,  terrain,  hostile 
forces,  or  rapid  movement,  opened  communications  with  naval  and  air 
forces,  and  eased  the  economic  burden  of  producing  immense  quantities  of 
wire. 

But  few  blessings  are  unmixed.  Just  as  the  telegraph  had  made  military 
communications  much  more  effective  but  had  also  increased  the  possibility 
of  interception  over  that  of  hand-carried  dispatches,  so  radio’s  vast  amplifica- 
tion of  military  communications  was  accompanied  by  an  enormously  greater 
probability  of  interception.  The  public,  omnidirectional  nature  of  radio 
transmissions,  which  makes  wireless  communication  so  easy  to  establish, 
makes  it  equally  easy  to  intercept.  It  was  no  longer  necessary  to  gain  physical 
access  to  a telegraph  line  behind  the  enemy’s  front  to  eavesdrop  upon  his 
communications.  A commander  had  only  to  sit  in  his  headquarters  and  tune 
his  radio  to  the  enemy’s  wavelength.  Radio  thereupon  introduced  two 
revolutionary  factors  in  the  interception  of  communications:  volume  and 
continuity. 

Communications  are  intercepted,  of  course,  so  that  they  may  be  submitted 
to  cryptanalysis.  Now  cryptanalysis  has  a potential  that  cryptography  does 
not.  Cryptanalysis  can  alter  the  status  quo.  Cryptography  can  at  best  con- 
serve it.  Cryptanalysis  can  bring  countries  into  war,  engender  naval  battles 
and  win  them,  compel  besieged  cities  to  yield,  condemn  queens  to  death  and 
prove  innocent  the  unjustly  accused.  Cryptanalysis  hammers  upon  the  real 
world.  Cryptography  does  not. 

Consequently,  the  telegraph,  which  affected  only  cryptography,  had  had 
a wholly  internal  influence  upon  cryptology.  That  a hierarchy  of  special 
systems  had  arisen  to  displace  the  nomenclator  interested  only  cryptologists ; 
it  did  not  matter  to  generals  or  statesmen.  And  although  the  telegraph  greatly 

298 


299 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

increased  the  volume  of  communications,  wiretapping  could  produce  inter- 
cepts only  at  rare  and  irregular  intervals.  Cryptanalysis  could  exercise  only 
transient  and  haphazard  effects.  Its  potential  remained  largely  unfulfilled. 
Kerckhoffs  accurately  regarded  it  as  an  auxiliary  to  cryptography,  a means 
to  the  end  of  perfecting  military  codes  and  ciphers.  Cryptanalysis  during  the 
telegraph  years  was  interesting  but  inconsequential,  intriguing  but  academic 
—an  ideal  topic  to  pass  a Victorian  tea-time,  perhaps,  but  not  much 
more. 

The  radio,  however,  turned  over  to  the  commander  a copy  of  every  enemy 
cryptogram  it  conveyed.  It  furnished  a constant  stream  of  intercepts.  And  with 
these,  cryptanalysis  could  bear  continually  upon  operations,  could  be  de- 
pended upon  for  information,  could  affect  events  decisively.  The  generals  and 
the  statesmen  took  notice.  This  was  no  longer  a polite  trifling  discussion;  this 
had  become  a weapon,  a pursuit  entailing  all  the  savagery  of  warfare  and  life 
against  death.  Radio  made  cryptanalysis  an  end  in  itself,  elevating  it  to  an 
importance  coordinate  with  that  of  cryptography,  if  not  superior  to  it.  Radio  s 
impact  upon  cryptology  reverberated  in  the  outside  world. 

Wire  and  wireless  thus  complemented  one  another.  The  telegraph  created 
modern  cryptography;  the  radio,  modern  cryptanalysis.  The  one  developed 
cryptology  internally,'  the  other  externally.  The  telegraph  had  given  cryptology 
shape  and  content;  now  the  radio  carried  it  out  into  the  arena  of  life.  One 
gave  it  form;  the  other,  meaning.  The  radio  completed  the  work  that  the 
telegraph  had  begun.  And  so  it  was  that  radio,  first  widely  used  in  the  Great 
War  of  1914  to  1918,  brought  cryptology  to  maturity. 

On  the  Western  Front,  only  France  was  ready.  Her  prewar  activities,  more 
extensive  and  better  conceived  than  those  of  any  other  nation,  had  prepared 
her.  Posts  that  had  intercepted  German  radiograms  in  peace  simply  continued 
to  do  so  in  war.  The  cipher  system  approved  by  the  Commission  on  Military 
Cryptography  went  into  effect.  The  cryptologic  section  set  up  by  Cartier  at 
the  War  Ministry  was  quickly  fleshed  out  with  mobilized  personnel.  His 
assistant,  Major  Marcel  Givierge,  arrived  alone  at  general  headquarters  to 
set  up  a cryptologic  section — and  a week  later  had  six  assistants  working 
round  the  clock.  For  the  first  few  days,  there  was  little  to  do,  but  when  the 
invading  Germans  crossed  the  frontier  early  in  August,  passing  beyond  the 
wires  of  their  telegraph  network,  their  messages  filled  the  air. 

The  French  hauled  them  in.  At  first  the  only  intercept  stations  were  in  the 
great  fortresses  of  Maubeuge,  Verdun,  Toul,  Epinal,  and  Belfort  and  at  three 
special  posts  at  Lille,  Rheims,  and  Besan<;on.  Later  in  the  war  Lrance  had  an 
elaborate  network,  with  the  country  divided  into  three  zones  centered  on 
Paris,  Lyons,  and  Bordeaux.  The  capital  itself  had  one  intercept  station  in  the 
Eiffel  Tower  and  another  in  a Metro  station  (Trocadero).  A line  of  six 
direction-finding  stations  extended  behind  the  entire  front.  All  these  stations 
were  connected  by  direct  wire  to  the  War  Ministry  at  14  Rue  Saint-Dominique 


300 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


in  Paris,  where  Colonel  Cartier’s  office  stood  next  to  the  telegraph  central. 
The  French  thus  received  German  radiograms  as  quickly  as  the  legitimate 
recipients.  During  the  course  of  the  war,  Cartier  estimated,  they  intercepted 
more  than  100,000,000  words,  or  enough  to  make  a library  of  a thousand 
average-sized  novels. 

At  the  start,  however,  the  organization  was  so  crude  that  the  French  even 
lacked  direction-finders.  They  had  to  work  instead  on  an  assumption  that  all 
German  stations  emitted  at  the  same  strength  and  that  the  loudness  of  the 
intercepted  signal  roughly  indicated  the  distance  of  the  transmitter.  Operators 
thus  noted  whether  they  heard  German  signals  very  loudly,  loudly,  medium 
loudly,  weakly,  or  very  weakly.  By  making  quantities  of  such  readings  and 
drawing  circles  on  the  map  with  a radius  equal  to  the  estimated  distance,  the 
French  less  than  two  weeks  after  the  outbreak  of  the  war  had  diagrammed  the 
probable  locations  of  the  German  stations — a grouping  that  later  proved  in 
large  measure  correct. 

The  French  also  recorded  call-signs,  volume  of  traffic,  and  correspondents 
for  all  stations.  These  soon  segregated  themselves  into  four  main  networks, 
each  of  which,  the  French  assumed,  belonged  to  a combat  group.  The  patterns 
of  correspondence  defined  the  headquarters  stations,  and  volume  soon 
differentiated  the  fast-moving  and  fast-sending  cavalry  stations  from  the 
infantry.  Occasional  cleartext  signatures  disclosed  the  commanders’  names. 
In  this  way,  the  French  gradually  built  up  a picture  of  the  German  forces 
facing  them. 

This  was  the  first  radio  traffic  analysis.  It  attained  a high  refinement  later 
in  the  war.  Traffic  analysis  aided  in  delineating  the  enemy  order  of  battle, 
and  frequently  forewarned  of  important  enemy  activities  by  detecting  an 
increase  in  message  volume.  It  also  made  a preliminary  sorting  of  messages 
for  cryptanalysis.  Different  enemy  armies  may  use  different  codes  with  the 
same  codewords  or  different  keys  for  a single  cipher  system,  and  only  the 
pinpointing  of  the  transmitter  by  direction-finding  and  call-sign  will  enable 
the  cryptanalyst  to  separate  messages  in  one  cryptographic  “language”  from 
those  in  another.  It  is  the  modern  version  of  looking  at  the  seal  and  the 
signature  of  an  intercepted  letter  so  that  cryptograms  from  Venice  will  not  be 
mixed  with  those  from  Parma.  The  careful  filing  of  every  detail  surrounding 
an  intercepted  radiogram— its  sender,  receiver,  time,  preamble,  length— often 
yielded  supplementary  benefits. 

Early  in  the  war,  for  example,  the  French  intercepted  a German  cleartext 
radiogram,  “Was  ist  Circourt?”  The  elaborate  cross-references  permitted  an 
easy  identification  of  the  cryptogram  that  gave  rise  to  the  query.  Meanwhile, 
the  geographic  service  furnished  the  information  that  the  name  “Circourt” 
showed  in  full  on  certain  German  general  staff  maps  while  the  troop  maps  had 
only  the  initial  C.  Other  characteristics  of  the  cryptogram  implied  that  it 
dealt  with  a troop  movement,  and  when  it  was  attacked  on  this  basis  and  on 
the  now  highly  probable  supposition  that  it  contained  the  plaintext  word 


301 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

Circourt,  it  succumbed.  The  French  then  recovered  the  key  and  read  all  the 
traffic  for  the  week  or  so  that  it  remained  in  force. 

The  cipher  was  the  ubchi,  the  famous  double  columnar  transposition  that 
the  Germans  had  used — and  the  French  had  known — since  even  before  the 
war.  It  employed  a keyword  or  keyphrase  prescribed  by  the  high  command, 
which,  before  actual  encipherment,  had  to  be  transformed  into  a numerical 
sequence.  This  was  done— as  is  conventional — by  numbering  the  letters  of  the 
keyword  in  their  alphabetical  order,  numbering  repeated  letters  from  left  to 
right.  For  example,  with  the  keyphrase  DIE  WACHT  AM  RHEIN,  the  two 
A’s  would  be  given  numbers  1 and  2.  There  are  no  B’s,  so  the  C would  take 
number  3,  the  D number  4,  the  two  E’s  5 and  6,  and  so  on:

Actual  encipherment  of  a plaintext— say  Tenth  division  X Attack  Mon- 
tigny  sector  at  daylight  X Gas  barrage  to  precede  you — involved  six  separate 
steps.  The  encipherer  (1)  wrote  the  plaintext  horizontally  into  a block  beneath 
this  numerical  sequence:

He  (2)  transcribed  the  letters  vertically  by  columns  in  order  of  the  key- 
numbers.  hkaay,  ityg,  dmtro,  and  so  on,  and  (3)  inscribed  them  horizontally 
into  another  block  under  the  same  numbers.  To  this  he  (4)  added  as  many 
null  letters  as  there  were  words  in  the  original  keyphrase— four,  in  this  case:

The  encipherer  then  (5)  again  took  out  these  letters  by  columns  in  key  order: 
vnner,  gdtea,  iagab,  and  so  on,  and  (6)  divided  them  into  the  standard  five-

Decipherment  was  precisely  the  inverse  of  this  process,  except  that  the 
decipherer  had  first  to  determine  the  size  of  the  transposition  block  so  that 
he  would  know  how  deep  his  columns  ran.  He  did  this  by  dividing  the  number 
of  digits  in  the  key  into  the  number  of  letters,  in  the  message;  in  this  case,  15 
into  71.  The  quotient — here,  4 — gave  the  number  of  full  lines  in  the  block; 
the  remainder — 1 1 — the  number  of  letters  in  the  final  incomplete  line. 

Solution  of  a single  message  enciphered  by  double  transposition  con- 
stitutes an  exceedingly  difficult  problem.  Why  this  is  so  can  best  be  under- 
stood from  the  cryptanalysis  of  a single  columnar  transposition.  This  is  a 
cipher  that  would  pass  its  plaintext  through  only  one  block,  taking  as  its 
ciphertext  the  result  of  step  2 of  the  double  transposition.  Obviously,  such  a 
ciphertext  is  composed  of  segments  that  were  originally  the  columns  of  the 
tableau.  A cryptanalyst  will  cut  up  that  ciphertext  into  what  he  thinks  might 
be  the  columns  and  then  will  juxtapose  one  segment  against  another  until  he 
finds  two  that  look  as  if  they  might  have  stood  next  to  one  another  in  the 
original  block. 

With  the  following  40-letter  cryptogram,  for  example,  the  cryptanalyst 
might  begin  by  assuming  a keylength  of  five.  The  columns  would  then  run 
eight  letters  deep,  and  the  cryptanalyst  would  slice  the  cryptogram  into  groups 
of  eight  letters  and  pair  the  first  group  with  the  other  four:

He  can 

then  either 

examine 

these 

by 

eye 

or 

use 

various 

mathematical 

techniques  to  see  which  two  segments  go  together  the  best.  One  such  tech- 
nique is  to  give  each  assumed  digraph  its  frequency  in  plaintext  and  then  to 
add  these  frequencies;  the  combination  with  the  highest  total  is  most  likely  to 
be  right.  Thus,  in  the  1-2  pairing,  en  has  a normal  frequency  of  25  (per  2,000 
English  digraphs),  ih  of  zero,  and  so  on,  with  the  eight  digraphs  totaling  to 
69.  The  other  combinations  come  to  73,  143,  77,  77,  73,  62,  and  78,  respec- 
tively. The  cryptanalyst  would  probably  select  the  1-4  combination  with  its 


303 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

143  total,  try  to  extend  its  digraphs  into  trigraphs  on  both  right  and  left,  and 
continue  like  that  until  he  has  reconstructed  the  entire  block.  If  nothing  looks 
good,  he  must  modify  his  original  guess  as  to  the  keylength  and  start  over. 

This  process  is  greatly  simplified  if  all  the  columns  are  the  same  length — a 
condition  that  obtains  when  the  block  is  completely  filled.  This  is  called 
regular  columnar  transposition.  In  irregular  columnar  transposition,  where 
the  last  line  of  the  block  is  not  full  and  the  columns  are  consequently  of  two 
different  lengths,  the  solution  involves  some  jockeying  up  and  down  of  the 
columns  to  get  the  proper  matches. 

This  sort  of  reconstruction  is,  in  exceptional  cases,  possible  on  a second- 
order  basis  to  permit  the  solution  of  a single  double-transposition  crypto- 
gram. In  theory  the  cryptanalyst  merely  has  to  build  up  the  columns  of  the 
second  block  by  twos  and  threes  so  that  their  digraphs  and  trigraphs  would 
in  turn  be  joinable  into  good  plaintext  fragments.  But  this  is  far  more  easily 
said  than  done.  Even  a gifted  cryptanalyst  can  accomplish  it  only  on 
occasion;  and  even  with  help,  such  as  a probable  word  like  Circourt,  it  is 
never  easy. 

Solution  becomes  relatively  simple,  however,  with  several  double- 
transposition cryptograms,  all  of  exactly  the  same  length  and  enciphered  by 
the  same  keys.  The  cryptanalyst  can  then  apply,  on  a letter-by-letter  basis,  the 
multiple-anagramming  technique  used  in  1878  by  Hassard,  Holden,  and 
Grosvenor  on  a word-by-word  basis.  Usually  the  two  messages  are  written 
out  one  underneath  the  other  on  strips  of  paper,  the  paper  is  cut  vertically  so 
that  two  letters — one  from  each  message — are  on  a single  slip,  and  the  slips 
tried  one  next  to  the  other  until  plaintext  appears  on  both  top  and  bottom. 
The  method  very  often  succeeds,  and  French  cryptanalysts  accordingly 
sought  cryptograms  of  identical  length  and  key  which  they  could  subject  to  it. 
The  Germans  eased  their  search  by  keeping  a single  key  in  effect  for  eight  or 
ten  days  over  the  entire  Western  Front.  And  as  summer  waned,  the  intercepts 
were  fluttering  onto  French  desks  as  thickly  as  the  leaves  of  the  war’s  first 
autumn. 

But  the  four  or  five  cryptanalysts  that  Cartier  had  under  him  at  the 
Ministry  of  War  could  not  concentrate  solely  on  them.  They  had  to  lend  a 
hand  with  the  naval  traffic,  because  the  Ministry  of  Marine  had  no  cryptana- 
lysts whatsoever,  and  with  the  Berlin-Madrid  diplomatic  correspondence, 
because  the  Foreign  Office  experts  were  too  overloaded  to  solve  them  quickly 
enough  to  be  useful.  Their  work  was  further  disrupted  when,  on  September  2, 
their  office  was  evacuated  to  Bordeaux  with  the  rest  of  the  government  in  the 
face  of  the  German  threat  to  Paris.  Despite  these  difficulties,  they  began  to 
send  daily  solutions  to  general  headquarters  later  that  month,  when  the  war 
had  been  in  progress  only  a few  weeks.  Sometimes  these  consisted  of  only  the 
gist  of  messages,  for  multiple  anagramming  sometimes  restores  only  patches 
of  plaintext.  A complete  solution,  however,  will  permit  reconstruction  of  the 
original  transposition  key.  This  reconstruction  is  a tedious  task,  but  it  is

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


worth  the  effort,  for  the  basic  key  would  unlock  all  the  cryptograms  enciphered 
in  it,  irrespective  of  identical-length  requirements.  On  October  1,  Cartier  and 
three  of  his  cryptanalysts — Major  Adolphe  Olivari  and  Officer-Interpreters 
Henry  Schwab  and  Gustave  Freyss — made  this  breakthrough  for  the  first 
time.  They  communicated  the  primary  ubchi  key  to  the  various  headquarters 
for  on-the-spot  decipherment  of  local  German  cryptograms. 

It  promptly  became  the  hottest  topic  of  conversation  in  the  French  army. 
The  news  raced  through  the  ranks,  and  telephone  lines  were  clogged  with 
excited  calls  about  the  key  recovery.  Soldiers  chattered  about  the  existence  of 
the  key  and  discussed  the  contents — real  or  imagined — of  cryptograms.  So 
serious  was  the  breach  of  security  that  on  October  3 G.H.Q.  had  to  issue  an 
order  to  try  to  stop  indiscreet  talk  about  it.  It  didn’t  help.  A few  weeks  later, 
after  the  Germans  had  changed  their  key,  an  officer  asked  loudly  in  the 
vestibule  of  headquarters  whether  it  had  been  discovered  again.  The  gossip 
swelled  and  expanded  until  it  even  reached  civilian  ears  in  Bordeaux. 

The  Germans  seemed  not  to  have  heard  it,  however,  for  they  continued  to 
use  their  double  transposition  with  their  infrequent  key  changes.  On  October 
17,  a new  key  went  into  effect,  but  the  French,  more  experienced  now,  re- 
covered this  one  four  days  later.  A new  change  at  the  beginning  of  November 
took  only  three  days  to  solve;  the  next  key  was  ascertained  the  very  day  it 
went  into  service.  One  of  the  new  solutions  enabled  the  French  to  bomb 
Thielt  in  occupied  Belgium  at  the  very  moment  that  Kaiser  Wilhelm  II  was 
entering  it  for  a review.  This  story  was  too  good  for  anyone  to  keep  to  him- 
self: soon  Le  Matin  published  it,  specifying  the  source  of  information.  This 
time  the  Germans  took  notice.  On  November  18,  they  instituted  an  entirely 
new  system. 

It  was  a case  of  what  cryptologists  call  “illusory  complication.”  For 
though  on  its  face  it  appeared  more  intricate  and  harder  to  solve  than  the 
double  transposition,  it  proved  to  be  solvable  with  a single  cryptogram  in- 
stead of  the  two  or  more,  limited  to  highly  specific  conditions,  required  for 
multiple  anagramming.  The  cipher  consisted  of  a Vigenere  encipherment  with 
key  ABC — which  could  be  done  in  the  head — followed  by  a single  columnar 
transposition.  One  weakness  was  that  the  ciphertext  equivalents  stood  at 
most  two  places  away  from  their  plaintext  in  the  normal  alphabet.  The  errors 
of  cipher  clerks  enabled  Lieutenant  Colonel  Anatole  Thevenin,  a member  of 
the  Commission  of  Military  Cryptography  who  was  serving  as  a part-time 
cryptanalyst  at  his  post  as  assistant  chief  of  staff  of  the  21st  Army  Corps,  to 
solve  it  by  December  10. 

A month  later  there  arrived  on  Cartier’s  desk  a memorandum  suggesting 
a simplified  method  of  breaking  this  system,  called  the  abc  by  the  French.  It 
had  been  written  by  Georges  Jean  Painvin,  a 29-year-old  reserve  lieutenant  of 
artillery  on  the  staff  of  the  6th  Army.  Painvin,  who  had  a mind  that  flashed 
and  cut  like  a rapier,  was  destined  to  become  the  Perseus  of  cryptologists  in 
the  epic  struggle  of  World  War  I,  slaying  one  German  cryptographic  Gorgon 


305 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

after  another.  Tall  and  slender,  with  dark,  rather  Spanish-looking  features 
and  piercing  black  eyes,  Painvin  worked  with  an  intense  concentration  that 
gave  no  hint  of  either  the  lightning  agility  of  his  intelligence  or  his  native 
charm  and  generosity.  A high-ranking  graduate  of  the  famed  Ecole  Poly- 
technique, he  had  taught  paleontology  at  the  Ecole  Nationale  Superieure  des 
Mines  in  Paris.  He  was  also  an  outstanding  ’cellist  and  had  once  won  first 
prize  in  this  instrument  at  the  Nantes  conservatory. 

When,  after  the  Battle  of  the  Marne,  the  fighting  settled  into  the  stagna- 
tion of  trench  warfare,  Painvin  found  his  afternoons  unoccupied.  He  had  be- 
come friendly  with  Captain  Victor  Paulier,  a cryptanalyst  who  had  been  sent 
to  the  6th  Army  from  Cartier’s  bureau,  and  from  him  learned  about  the 
ubchi.  Painvin  took  up  multiple  anagramming  of  the  German  intercepts 
much  as  one  might  do  crossword  puzzles,  and  soon  his  recreations  were 
crowned  with  practical  success.  He  recovered  several  keys  which  were  reported 
to  Cartier,  who,  after  receiving  the  abc  memorandum,  dispatched  his  con- 
gratulations to  Painvin. 

On  several  occasions  during  inspection  visits  to  6th  Army  headquarters 
at  the  Chateau  de  Montgobert  near  Villers-Cotterets,  the  Minister  of  War, 
Alexandre  Millerand,  asked  the  commander,  General  Michel-Joseph  Maun- 
oury,  to  release  Painvin  for  service  at  the  Bureau  du  Chiffre.  But  Painvin  had 
been  through  too  much  with  the  elderly  Maunoury  to  feel  able  to  leave  him. 
Maunoury  finally  yielded  to  the  pressure,  however,  and  in  March  of  1915 
told  Painvin  to  go  for  two  weeks  and  see  whether  he  could  be  of  more  use 
with  the  cryptanalysts  than  with  the  6th  Army  staff.  Painvin  went;  soon 
thereafter,  Maunoury  was  grievously  wounded.  There  was  now  no  one  to 
recall  the  young  cryptanalyst,  and  he  remained  in  Cartier’s  office  for  the  rest 
of  the  war. 

That  office  now  headed  the  first  echeloned  organization  in  the  history  of 
cryptology.  The  Bureau  du  Chiffre,  which  had  returned  to  the  War  Ministry 
building  in  Paris,  employed  several  dozen  people,  of  whom  only  about  10 
were  cryptanalysts.  It  worked  in  the  cryptologic  stratosphere — inter-Allied 
communications,  enemy  diplomatic  and  naval  cryptograms,  new  military 
systems,  and  messages  from  distant  fronts.  Its  chief,  Cartier,  also  directed 
the  intercept  service.  Under  the  Bureau  du  Chiffre  was  G.H.Q.’s  Service  du 
Chiffre,  headed  by  Givierge.  Its  staff  of  15  officers  handled  the  cryptographic 
correspondence  of  the  French  headquarters  and  solved  the  strategic  crypto- 
grams of  the  German  Army,  usually  with  methods  and  keys  supplied  by  the 
Paris  bureau. 

Beneath  it  in  turn  came  the  cryptologic  offices  that  were  attached  to  the 
various  army  and  army  group  headquarters  in  the  same  way  that  those  head- 
quarters had  their  own  intelligence,  signal,  and  other  specialized  organizations 
for  their  own  needs.  Paulier  constituted  one  such  office.  They  had  been 
inaugurated  by  an  order  of  September  17,  1914,  which  attached  a specialist  to 
each  major  unit  to  enforce  the  cryptographic  regulations  for  their  own  troops. 


306 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


France  was  preparing  a general  advance  and  did  not  want  its  cipher  clerks 
making  the  blunders  on  the  radio  that  they  were  then  making  on  wire  telegra- 
phy. Eventually  this  one  man  became  three,  including  cryptanalysts.  Their 
presence  near  the  front  enabled  them  to  garner  many  details  helpful  in 
solutions.  If,  for  example,  a message  was  sent  to  a German  artillery  unit,  and 
two  hours  later  that  unit  laid  a barrage  on  a certain  sector,  the  French 
cryptanalyst  would  have  a number  of  probable  words  with  which  to  rip  open 
the  message.  These  army  bureaus  generally  solved  low-level  tactical  com- 
munications. 

The  various  branches  of  the  decentralized  French  organization  worked  in 
close  cooperation.  Results  or  partial  results  were  flashed  from  one  to  another 
as  soon  as  a break  was  made:  the  War  Ministry  and  G.H.Q.  later  communi- 
cated via  a telautograph,  which,  since  it  was  the  only  one  in  existence,  they 
regarded  as  sufficiently  secure  to  carry  some  of  the  most  secret  messages  in 
France. 

By  May  of  1915  the  abc  cipher  had  vanished.  The  end  of  the  war  of 
movement  greatly  reduced  the  volume  of  German  military  radio  messages, 
and  for  most  of  1915  traffic  was  at  a very  low  level.  The  lull  gave  the  French  a 
chance  to  attack  other  problems.  Painvin,  Schwab,  Givierge,  Olivari,  and 
Paulier  cudgeled  naval  dispatches.  Officer-Interpreters  Belard  and  Trannoy 
struggled  with  Bulgarian,  Greek,  and  Turkish  cryptograms.  The  several  codes 
used  in  the  busy  Berlin-Madrid  and  Vienna-Madrid  diplomatic  circuits  were 
under  attack,  the  German-language  ones  by  Painvin,  Olivari,  and  Paul- 
Brutus  Dejardin,  the  Spanish  by  Lieutenant  Pannier  and  Officer-Interpreter 
J.  Periere. 

The  cryptanalysts  also  engaged  in  retrospective  solution  of  some  of  the 
cryptograms  of  the  first  days  of  the  war.  These  helped  explain  why  the  Ger- 
mans had  made  the  historic  turn  to  the  east  that  led  to  the  crucial  Battle  of  the 
Marne,  where  they  were  stopped,  and  shed  light  on  the  thinking  of  German 
commanders  during  the  critical  “race  to  the  sea,”  which  established  warfare's 
first  continuous  front.  The  picture  that  emerged  of  the  German  way  of  con- 
ducting war  was  so  helpful  to  the  French  staff  that  General  Joffre,  the  com- 
mander in  chief,  wrote  to  the  Minister  of  War:  “I  have,  like  all  the  army  com- 
manders, during  the  last  few  days  learned  to  realize  the  value  of  the  services 
which  have  been  rendered  by  the  cryptanalytic  bureau  of  your  department. 
Please  transmit  the  thanks  of  all  of  us  to  Major  Cartier  and  his  group.” 

The  radio  lull  ended  explosively  at  the  start  of  1916.  This  was  the  year  in 
which  the  Germans  oscillated  wildly  over  the  entire  cryptographic  spectrum 
in  a frantic  hunt  for  the  ideal  cipher.  But  the  French  kept  up  with  them,  and 
sometimes  G.H.Q.  received  two  or  three  solutions  of  a new  problem  within  a 
few  hours. 

Every  possible  weakness  was  exploited  in  these  solutions.  Particularly 
helpful  were  stereotyped  messages.  “Night  calm ; nothing  to  report”  appeared 


307 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

with  what  Givierge  called  “terrible  regularity”  in  German  transmissions.  One 
command  required  regular  morning  reports  from  its  units  in  line.  When  the 
cipher  changed,  the  practice  did  not,  and  the  French  promptly  pried  open  the 
cipher  with  the  leverage  of  a known  plaintext.  The  French  turned  to  similar 
advantage  the  thoughtless  German  practice  of  checking  out  new  systems  by 
enciphering  proverbs  as  test  messages.  The  German  version  of  “The  early 
bird  gets  the  worm”  was  a particular  favorite — but  it  was  the  French  who 
profited. 

Their  familiarity  with  German  habits  of  phraseology  and  transmission 
technique  greatly  helped.  They  had  gained  this  insight  during  the  very  first 
days  of  the  war,  when  the  radio  operators  in  General  Georg  von  der  Marwitz’ 
cavalry  corps  on  the  wheeling  German  flank  became  simultaneously  intoxi- 
cated by  their  speedy  conquests,  overwhelmed  by  the  volume  of  their  traffic, 
and  exasperated  by  the  nuisance  of  ciphering.  They  began  sending  messages 
in  clear.  Soon,  by  a kind  of  cryptologic  Gresham's  Law,  everyone  was  doing 
it,  while  the  French  took  copious  notes.  They  bore  down  mercilessly  on 
ciphering  errors,  studied  captured  notebooks  with  cryptographic  worksheets, 
compared  messages  from  different  sectors  that,  individually,  offered  little  but, 
conjointly,  suggested  much.  They  fished  about  wildly  for  keywords — and, 
given  the  German  predilection  for  patriotic  terms  such  as  VATERLAND, 
KAISER,  and  DEUTSCHLAND,  sometimes  hooked  the  prize.  They 
bombarded  enemy  trenches  and  feigned  preparations  for  attacks  just  to  get 
some  badly  needed  probable  words  into  enemy  cryptograms.  And,  above  all, 
they  carved  away  at  the  ciphers  with  their  keen,  surgical  minds,  dissecting, 
discarding  hypotheses,  until  at  last  they  cut  through  to  the  heart  of  the  system. 
Painvin  in  particular  shone  brilliantly  in  this  pure  cryptanalysis. 

The  first  of  the  new  German  systems  appeared  with  the  outburst  of  new 
wireless  activity.  The  French  high  command  believed  that  these  signs  presaged 
a new  German  attack,  and  Painvin  and  Olivari  fell  upon  the  intercepts.  They 
quickly  decided  that  half  of  them  were  fake — mere  meaningless  strings  of 
letters.  But  what  messages  were  the  real  cryptograms  carrying?  Within  two 
weeks,  they  discovered  that  the  system  consisted  of  an  interrupted-key  Vigen- 
ere  with  key  ABCD  followed  by  a single  columnar  transposition.  The  key 
interruptions  were  controlled  by  the  numbers  of  the  transposition  key.  The 
system  was  an  elaboration  of  the  old  abc;  they  called  it  the  abcd.  The  plain- 
texts proved  to  be  nothing  but  simple  ciphering  exercises,  portions  of  com- 
muniques, extracts  from  newspapers,  even  trigonometrical  formulas.  This 
showed  that  the  entire  radio  busyness  was  a German  deception,  and  the 
cryptanalysts  thereby  relieved  the  French  staff  of  some  of  its  worries. 

The  cumbersome  abcd  expired  in  April.  It  was  replaced  for  the  first  time 
in  German  cryptography  by  pure  substitution  ciphers.  These  were  numerous, 
but  of  two  general  kinds:  monalphabetic  substitution  in  which  the  choice  of 
the  24  available  alphabets  was  left  to  the  encipherer,  and  polyalphabetic 
substitution  with  12,  24,  or  25  mixed  alphabets.  These  grew  ever  more 


308 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


complicated,  but  as  the  development  was  progressive  the  French  never  lost 
cryptanalytic  contact.  Painvin  solved  one  that  spring  thanks  to  a Bavarian 
prince’s  telling  his  parents,  the  king  and  queen,  that  he  had  been  wounded. 
The  polyalphabetic  systems  culminated  in  one  used  between  Berlin  and  Con- 
stantinople. It  employed  25  alphabets,  required  32  tableaux,  and  was  so 
excessively  complex  that  only  cipher  clerks  comfortably  ensconced  in  quiet, 
well-equipped  headquarters  offices  could  handle  it.  In  fact,  it  was  too  elaborate, 
and  the  pendulum  swung  away  from  substitution  to  transposition.  At  the  end 
of  1916,  transposition  messages  again  appeared  in  German  military  com- 
munications. 

By  January,  1917,  the  French  cryptanalysts  recognized  these  as  turning 
grilles.  About  all  that  these  grilles  have  in  common  with  the  fixed  concealment 
grille  of  Cardano  is  the  name  and  the  openings  in  the  mask.  The  turning 
grille  is  usually  a square  sheet  of  cardboard  divided  into  cells;  one  quarter  of 
these  are  punched  out  in  a pattern  such  that  when  the  grille  is  rotated  to  its 
four  positions,  all  the  cells  on  the  paper  beneath  will  be  exposed  and  none 
will  be  exposed  more  than  once.  A 6x6  grille  might  look  like  this: 


This  is  laid  over  a sheet  of  paper  and  the  first  nine  letters  are  written  through 
the  apertures.  Then  it  is  turned  90  degrees,  the  next  nine  letters  are  written 
through  the  openings  in  their  new  position,  and  so  on  for  two  more  turns. 
By  then  each  of  the  36  cells  on  the  paper  will  have  a letter  inscribed  in  it,  and 
the  cryptographer  can  read  it  off  in  any  pattern  he  chooses — usually  by  rows. 
Messages  longer  than  36  letters  must  repeat  the  process;  in  the  last  section  of 
less  than  36  letters,  the  unwanted  cells  can  simply  be  blocked  out. 

The  Germans  provided  their  signal  troops  with  a variety  of  sizes  for 
different  length  messages.  Each  grille  had  a codename:  anna  for  25  letters, 
berta  for  36,  clara,  49,  dora,  64,  emil,  81,  franz,  100.  These  codenames 
were  changed  weekly. 


309 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

Grille  systems  are  particularly  susceptible  to  multiple  anagramming — 
which  is  the  general  solution  for  transposition  systems — because  their 
sections  are  of  necessity  of  equal  length.  But  the  system  produces  intriguing 
geometrical  symmetries,  and  the  French  soon  devised  attacks  exploiting  this 
and  other  weaknesses.  The  grilles  lasted  four  months. 

Britain,  too,  had  her  military  cryptanalytic  bureaus.  But  she  had  made  no 
more  preparations  for  them  before  the  war  than  she  had  done  for  Room  40, 
and  her  Army  cryptanalysts,  expert  though  they  became,  never  achieved  the 
proficiency  of  the  French. 

Her  setup  was  essentially  the  same  as  France’s.  The  head  organization, 
M.I.  1(b),  was  attached  to  the  War  Office.  A field  agency  was  established  at 
British  Expeditionary  Force  headquarters,  and  individual  cryptanalysts  were 
stationed  with  the  several  armies. 

M.I.  1(b)  was  still  a small,  four-man  section — 1(b) — of  the  Military  Intel- 
ligence Division  in  December  of  1915  when  Malcolm  Vivian  Hay  of  Seaton 
was  placed  in  charge.  Hay,  then  34,  was  the  grandson  of  the  second  son  of  the 
seventh  Marquess  of  Tweeddale  and  had  succeeded  to  the  Seaton  Estates  near 
Aberdeen  when  he  was  2.  After  an  education  at  Beaumont  College  and 
abroad,  he  returned  to  supervise  his  farms;  he  joined  the  Gordon  Highlanders 
as  a captain  at  the  outbreak  of  war.  He  was  machine-gunned  at  the  Battle  of 
Mons  and  was  captured  by  the  Germans  when  he  was  left  on  the  field  by  the 
British  retreat.  Partly  paralyzed  as  a result  of  his  head  wound,  he  was  re- 
patriated in  February,  1915,  as  unfit  for  military  duty.  After  learning  to  walk 
with  the  aid  of  a cane,  he  was  promoted  to  major  and  given  command  of 
M.I.  1(b). 

He  began  at  once  to  scour  the  universities  for  bright  young  men,  preferably 
language  scholars,  to  supplement  the  three  original  civilians  on  the  staff: 
J.  St.  Vincent  Pletts,  a radio  engineer  from  Marconi’s  Wireless  Telegraph 
Company;  J.  D.  Crocker,  a young  Cambridge  scholar,  and  Oliver  Strachey  of 
the  Indian  Civil  Service,  who  liked  cryptanalysis  so  much  that  he  switched 
after  the  war  from  administering  the  East  Indian  Railway  to  codebreaking  for 
the  Foreign  Office.  Hay  recruited  a remarkable  concentration  of  men  who 
were  later  to  achieve  eminence,  if  listing  in  Who's  Who  may  be  taken  as  an 
index.  Among  them  were  his  chief  assistant,  John  Fraser,  32,  later  professor 
of  Celtic  as  a fellow  of  Jesus  College,  Oxford;  Arthur  Surridge  Hunt,  45,  then 
and  later  professor  of  papyrology  at  Oxford  and  one  of  the  world’s  most 
eminent  authorities  on  ancient  writing;  David  Samuel  Margoliouth,  58, 
professor  of  Arabic  at  Oxford,  later  president  of  the  Royal  Asiatic  Society 
and  author  of  many  works  on  Arabic  literature  and  history;  Zachary  Nugent 
Brooke,  33,  then  lecturer  in  history  at  Cambridge,  later  professor  of  medieval 
history  there  and  an  editor  of  the  Cambridge  Medieval  History,  Edward 
Thurloe  Leeds,  39,  then  assistant  keeper  of  the  department  of  antiquities  of 
the  Ashmolean  Museum  and,  after  the  war,  keeper  of  that  first  public  museum

Amongst  the  Alps.  The  chief  himself,  Hay,  became  well  known  as  a historian, 
writing  half  a dozen  major  historical  works  (most  presenting  the  Catholic 
viewpoint  on  controversial  questions)  and  almost  as  many  on  other  subjects. 
His  first  study,  A Chain  of  Errors  in  Scottish  History,  concerning  early  church 
history,  was  violently  denounced  and  extravagantly  praised.  But  subsequent 
works,  such  as  The  Enigma  of  James  II,  were  received  with  more  moderate  but 
more  extended  applause,  and  his  later  The  Foot  of  Pride,  an  erudite  examina- 
tion of  European  anti-Semitism,  was  universally  lauded. 

The  staff  of  M.I.  1(b)  was  to  number  84,  including  30  women,  by  the  end 
of  the  war.  To  shelter  this  growing  organization,  as  well  as  to  conceal  it  from 
the  curious,  the  War  Office  requisitioned  a largish  private  house  at  5 Cork 
Street,  several  blocks  from  its  own  building  in  Whitehall  and  behind  the 
fashionable  Burlington  Arcade.  Hay  immediately  instituted  a complicated 
entrance  procedure  that  involved  locking  visitors  in  a room  temporarily  to 
prevent  their  wandering  about  the  premises. 

Early  in  the  war,  the  French  had  provided  the  English  with  keys  and 
techniques  for  the  German  military  ciphers,  and  with  this  help,  M.I.  1(b) 
was  soon  passing  valuable  information  to  the  army  command.  Eventually  a 
pool  of  skilled  cryptanalysts  was  built  up,  including  one  who  was  familiar 
with  Turkish.  Perhaps  the  most  brilliant  at  Cork  Street  was  Captain  G.  L. 
Brooke-Hunt  of  the  Royal  Engineers,  who  had  served  in  the  Indian  Army. 

Among  his  most  difficult  problems  was  the  “Fur  god”  system,  which  was 
so-called  because  all  messages  in  it  bore  that  prefix  to  show  that  they  were 
for  the  German  wireless  station  whose  call  letters  were  god.  These  messages 
were  sent  irregularly  about  three  times  a week  from  poz,  the  powerful  German 
station  at  Nauen  outside  of  Berlin.  They  began  in  1916  and  lasted  until  the 
fall  of  1918,  making  the  Fur  god  the  longest-lived  German  cipher.  Because 
the  dispatches  bore  no  signature  and  no  address  beyond  the  call-sign, 
suspicion  grew  that  the  cryptograms  concealed  instructions  to  German  secret 
agents. 

Brooke-Hunt  solved  the  Fiir  god  early  in  1917.  It  proved  to  be  a poly- 
alphabetic  system  using  22  mixed  alphabets  and  30  incoherent  keys  of  from 
11  to  18  letters.  The  messages  were  numbered  serially  from  January  to 
December  in  each  year  and  the  keywords  repeated  in  cycles  of  30.  The 
dispatches  were  transmitted  by  the  political  section  of  the  German  general 
staff  to  an  expedition  sent  to  North  Africa  under  Captain  von  Todenwart  to 


311 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

foment  uprisings  by  the  Arab  population.  Some  of  the  messages  were  orders, 
but  many  forwarded  reports  of  the  slaughter  of  colonial  troops  on  the  Western 
Front  as  a result  of  alleged  French  placement  of  them  in  the  most  dangerous 
positions  in  the  line.  Von  Todenwart  was  directed  to  spread  these  reports  as 
anti-Allied  propaganda. 

Among  the  messages  were  several  arranging  for  a submarine  to  bring 
rifles  and  ammunition  to  Abd  el  Malek,  a Moroccan  nationalist.  Hay  was  in 
the  closest  personal  touch  with  Captain  Hall  at  the  Admiralty.  Information 
was  passed,  wheels  turned,  air  commands  were  notified,  and  shortly  after  the 
U-boat  surfaced  in  the  blue  Mediterranean  she  had  submerged  again — this 
time  involuntarily  and  for  good,  taking  her  cargo  with  her.  Later  in  the  war 
Brooke-Hunt  read  with  mingled  pleasure  and  regret  a Fiir  god  message 
declaring  that  “For  security  reasons,  U-boat  arrival  notifications  will  no  longer 
be  made.” 

Hay,  who  was  admired  by  his  subordinates  as  “a  very  good  chief”  (they 
later  gave  him  a silver  loving  cup  and  a book  of  photographs  with  crypto- 
graphic inscriptions  and  affectionate  remembrances),  was  given  charge  of 
constructing  codes  and  ciphers  for  British  forces  early  in  1917.  He  took  his 
responsibilities  seriously  enough  to  make  a visit  to  Cartier’s  office  despite  his 
own  disability,  and  later  in  the  war  his  office  sent  representatives  to  the  Near 
East  to  coordinate  cryptologic  security  there. 

But  M.I.  1(b)  apparently  had  no  hand  in  the  development  of  perhaps  the 
finest  British  cryptanalyst  of  the  war.  O.  T.  (for  Oswald  Thomas)  Hitchings 
had  been  destined  to  be  a schoolmaster  like  his  father,  but  he  loved  music  so 
much  that  he  became  an  organist  instead.  Later  he  taught  music  in  two 
preparatory  schools,  and  while  doing  this  learned  French  and  German  so  well 
by  correspondence  that  he  won  an  honors  degree  in  them  from  London 
University.  In  1911  he  went  to  Bridlington  Grammar  School  as  modern 
language  master.  Quiet,  conscientious,  he  volunteered  for  the  Army  at  the 
start  of  the  war  and  went  directly  to  France,  where  his  knowledge  of  lan- 
guages was  put  to  use  in  the  Field  Censor’s  Office.  One  day  his  colonel  asked 
him  if  he  would  like  to  try  solving  the  German  messages  that  were  being 
intercepted.  He  said  he  would,  found  he  had  a flair  for  the  work,  and  by  1918, 
when  he  was  42,  had  risen  to  the  rank  of  captain  and  the  command  of 
Intelligence  e(c),  2d  echelon — the  Code  and  Cipher  Solution  Section  of  the 
British  Expeditionary  Force’s  general  headquarters. 

This  section  was  located  in  Le  Touquet,  a Channel-side  resort  town  not 
far  from  British  G.H.Q.  at  Montreuil,  probably  for  reasons  of  security.  Here 
the  serious,  earnest  Hitchings  was  assisted  by  a debonair,  kilted  Scot,  Duncan 
Campbell  Macgregor.  Under  them  worked  the  cryptanalysts  at  the  several 
army  headquarters;  at  one  of  these  an  American  visitor  was  astonished  to  see 
a German  prisoner  of  war,  still  wearing  his  uniform,  puzzling  over  the  inter- 
cepts of  his  native  land ! Hitchings’  solutions  were  so  extraordinarily  valuable 
that  one  colonel  exclaimed  that  he  was  worth  four  divisions  to  the  British.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


With  this  superb  background  in  cryptanalysis  to  instruct  them,  what 
systems  did  the  Allies  use?  The  British  employed  the  Playfair  with  random 
keysquare.  Its  use  extended  even  to  Lawrence  of  Arabia.  Behind  the  lines,  the 
French  corresponded  in  a four-digit  superenciphered  code;  they  changed  it 
three  times  between  August  1,  1914,  and  January  15,  1915.  Series  65  of  this 
code  chiffre  was  a two-part  code  of  about  2,300  four-digit  groups.  A tableau 
de  concordance  superenciphered  number  pairs  into  letter  pairs  with  a strad- 
dling gimmick : the  first  digit  was  chopped  off  and  enciphered  separately,  and 
the  subsequent  division  into  pairs  straddled  the  gap  between  codegroups. 
This  kept  a codegroup  from  being  always  superenciphered  the  same  way.  A 
sample  encoding  and  encipherment  of  the  plaintext  “The  relief  will  take  place 
tomorrow  morning”  in  Series  65  would  be:

encicode  rh  br  ag  nu  au  hb  tr  bu  ga  hi  bi  is  si 


The  remarkable  French  acuity  in  matters  cryptological  is  nowhere  better 
shown  than  in  the  instruction  accompanying  this  code:  “Exceptionally,  if 
you  do  not  have  the  time  to  encipher  entirely,  transmit  in  clear.”  The  French 
knew  that  partial  encoding,  which  offered  quick  and  easy  entries  into  a code 
(“Colonel  seriously  6386”  could  have  but  one  meaning,  for  example),  posed  a 
danger  to  the  compromise  of  all  communications  that  a single  cleartext 
message,  which  at  best  disclosed  a single  piece  of  information,  did  not. 

In  the  field,  the  French  sometimes  used  a mixed-alphabet  polyalphabetic 
with  a running  key.  But  the  cipher  they  relied  upon  for  three  years  was  an 
interrupted  columnar  transposition  that  was,  paradoxically,  theoretically 
weaker  than  the  German  double  transposition.  It  employed  the  usual  trans- 
position block  with  a key  sequence  in  which  the  plaintext  was  inscribed 
horizontally.  The  vertical  transcription,  however,  was  preceded  by  a reading 
out  of  letters  on  certain  diagonals.  For  example,  with  the  message  Enemy  has 
brought  up  four  howitzer  batteries  and  three  companies  Stop  We  can  hold  but 
we  need  more  fifty  calibre  machine  gun  ammunition  Third  Battalion  (plus  three 
nulls  to  complete  the  last  five-letter  group),  and  the  key  (the  French  used  long 
ones)  MADEMOISELLE  FROM  ARMENT1ERES,  with  the  rightward 
diagonals  starting  under  3,  5,  7,  8,  and  10  to  be  taken  off  in  that  order, 
followed  by  the  leftward  diagonals  under  16,  18,  21,  and  26:

The  transcription  begins  with  eapch  and  continues  with  behet.  The  left- 
ward diagonals  skip  over  any  letter  previously  transcribed;  thus,  diagonal  21 
would  read  tlb  and  not  tdleb.  Similarly,  the  vertical  transcriptions  ignore 
any  letters  taken  by  the  diagonals:  column  1 would  read  nrst  and  not 
nrsit.  The  full  transcription,  which  would  naturally  be  divided  into  groups  of 
five  for  transmission,  is : eapch  behet  uoea  wnrn  gdbhi  ytii  oeta  tlb  ziom

The  diagonals  break  up  the  columnar  segments  that  the  cryptanalyst 
juxtaposes  and  adjusts  to  solve  uninterrupted  columnar  transpositions.  But 
the  diagonals  constitute  segments  of  their  own,  and  the  columns,  though  frag- 
mented, keep  their  constituent  letters  together  instead  of  scattering  them,  as 
does  the  double  transposition.  The  cryptanalyst  can  seize  upon  these  weak- 
nesses to  reconstruct  the  tableau.  The  task  is  admittedly  more  difficult  than 
with  an  ordinary  columnar  transposition,  but  it  can  be  effected  with  a single 
message  far  more  easily  than  with  the  German  system. 

Why,  then,  did  the  Germans  not  solve  it  for  the  three  years  that  the 
French  kept  it  in  force? 

The  reason  is  absurdly  simple:  Germany  had  no  cryptanalysts  on  the 
Western  Front  for  the  first  two  years  of  the  war. 

She  had  entered  the  war  with  no  military  cryptanalytic  service.  (An 
expected  side  effect  appeared  in  the  erratic  development  of  German  crypto- 
graphy. The  absence  of  the  stabilizing  influence  of  cryptanalysts  resulted  in 
the  overcorrective  swings  from  one  field  cipher  to  another  in  1915  and  1916. 
The  lack  of  cryptanalytic  instruction  also  forced  the  Germans  to  attend  the 
hard-knocks  school  of  cryptography,  learning  through  one  painful  experience 
after  another  the  dangers  of  normal  alphabets,  patriotic  keys,  their  inherent 
love  of  order,  and  the  like.)  But  even  if  Germany  had  had  well-trained 
cryptanalysts  available  at  the  start  of  the  war,  she  would  have  had  little 
opportunity  to  use  them. 

German  victories  drove  the  French  back  into  their  own  territory,  where 
they  used  their  own  wire  network  for  communication  and  thus  deprived  the 
enemy  of  much  chance  of  intercepting  radio  messages.  The  same  situation 
freed  the  French  radio  for  intercept  work  whereas  the  Germans  had  to  use 
their  wireless  for  communication.  French  cryptanalysis  thus  owed  much  of  its 
success  to  the  highly  dubious  advantage  of  having  the  war  fought  on  French 
territory.  One  may  wonder  whether  the  French  would  have  preferred  solving 
enemy  cryptograms  or  the  nondesolation  of  dozens  of  villages,  orchards, 
fields,  and  forests  in  their  northern  provinces. 

As  the  war  progressed,  the  French  began  using  radio  more  and  more.  By 
1916,  the  Germans  awoke  to  their  opportunities  and  set  up  the  Abhorch- 
dienst  (“Intercept  Service”).  Its  main  station  was  at  Neumiinster,  where 
cryptanalysts,  many  of  them  recruited  from  the  ranks  of  mathematicians, 


314 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


were  soon  solving  Playfairs  within  a day  after  a key  change.  Later,  the  Ger- 
mans established  a cryptanalytic  center  at  their  Western  Front  G.H.Q.  at  the 
Belgian  resort  of  Spa.  But  they  never  caught  up  with  the  Allies,  who  had  had 
the  inestimable  advantage  of  familiarity  with  German  phraseology  and  idio- 
syncrasies, gained  in  the  first  chaotic  days,  and  of  preventative  improvements 
in  their  own  communications. 

Both  sides,  however,  were  equally  adept  at  picking  up  the  enemy’s  front- 
line telephone  messages — an  eavesdropping  that  was  facilitated  by  the  fixed 
nature  of  trench  warfare.  Conversations  could  be  heard  either  by  induction 
through  earth  pickups,  or  by  actual  taps  of  enemy  wires  by  intrepid  soldiers 
who  crawled  across  no-man’s-land.  Both  sides  obtained  enormous  quantities 
of  intelligence  from  this  source.  Officers  and  men  repeatedly  violated  the 
strict  regulations  against  transmitting  any  important  information  over  field 
telephones. 

In  1916,  for  example,  the  British  sustained  casualties  in  the  thousands  in  a 
fierce  battle  to  take  Ovillers-la-Boiselle  on  the  Somme.  Battalions  were 
decimated  as  they  went  over  the  top.  When  the  British  finally  captured  their 
objective,  they  found  in  one  enemy  dugout  a complete  transcript  of  one  of 
their  operation  orders.  A brigade  major  had  read  it  in  full  over  a field  tele- 
phone despite  the  protest  of  his  subordinate  that  the  procedure  was  dangerous. 
“Hundreds  of  brave  men  perished,”  the  British  signal  historian  related, 
“hundreds  more  were  maimed  for  life  as  the  result  of  this  one  act  of  incredible 
foolishness.”  The  search  for  protection  resulted  in  the  ultimate  cryptographic 
development  of  the  First  World  War.  These  were  the  trench  codes. 

In  February  of  1916,  General  Auguste  Dubail,  the  handsome  and  ener- 
getic commander  of  the  French  Army  of  Lorraine,  requested  some  kind  of 
code  for  telephone  use  because  indiscretions  had  drawn  so  many  heavy 
bombardments  onto  his  reserves.  The  cryptographic  office  produced  a carnet 
de  chiffre  (“cipher  notebook”).  Important  words  in  telephone  messages  were 
to  be  spelled  out  in  code  form  by  replacing  their  letters  with  the  two-digit 
groups  of  the  carnet.  Soon  a table  of  50  common  expressions  was  added,  and 
the  carnet  authorized  for  use  by  wireless  telegraphy.  This  spurred  its  enlarge- 
ment into  a small  code  of  three-letter  groups  for  use  by  smaller  units.'  This 
was  called  a “carnet  reduit”  (“condensed  notebook”)  in  contrast  to  the  larger 
headquarters  codes. 

The  carnets  were  replaced  from  time  to  time.  Each  had  a name — olive, 
urbain,  and  so  on — and  the  initial  letter  of  that  name,  repeated  three  times, 
indicated  the  carnet  that  had  encoded  the  message.  The  carnets  were  caption 
codes:  the  plaintext  elements  were  arranged  in  categories,  such  as  artillery, 
infantry,  numbers,  letters,  common  words,  prepared  phrases,  place-names, 
verbs,  and  so  forth.  Though  the  codewords  of  the  early  carnets  ran  in  alpha- 
betical order,  the  topical  distribution  of  the  plaintext  ruffled  the  one-part 
aspect  of  the  code.  Later  carnets  thoroughly  mixed  the  codewords  as  well. 


315 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

Germany  did  not  start  using  codes  until  a year  after  France  did,  but  then 
they  evolved  in  roughly  the  same  way. 

The  simple  Befehlstafel  (“command  table”)  came  first.  A small  trench 
code  in  which  bigrams  represented  common  words  or  letters,  it  superseded 
the  grilles  in  March  of  1917.  Some  Befehlstafeln  were  in  the  form  of  note- 
books with  variable  pagination ; others  were  constructed  as  cipher  disks,  in 
which  a change  of  position  would  give  a change  of  equivalencies.  In  June 
these  were  supplemented  on  the  regimental  level  by  the  Satzbuch  (“sentence 
book”),  the  German  version  of  the  French  code  chiffre.  The  2,000  (later 
4,000)  plaintext  expressions  of  the  Satzbuch  were  represented  by  thoroughly 
mixed  three-letter  codewords.  It  provided  numerous  homophones  ( anschluss 
Jehlt , [“link-up  missed”]  = kxl,  roq,  udz)  and  many  Blinde  Signale,  or  nulls. 
Unlike  the  code  chiffre,  it  was  not  superenciphered;  it  relied  instead  on 
planned  obsolescence  for  security.  At  first  a new  codebook  was  issued  about 
every  month,  but  the  interval  was  gradually  cut  down  to  about  15  days.  This 
multiplicity  of  codes  in  time  was  matched  by  one  in  space.  Where  at  first  the 
entire  front  shared  a single  code,  soon  army  groups  and  then  individual  armies 
had  their  own  Satzbucher. 

The  French  called  these  codes  the  “kru”  or  “krusa”  codes,  because  all 
their  codewords  began  with  one  of  those  five  letters.  The  first  one  disconcerted 
the  Service  du  Chiffre,  unaccustomed  as  it  was  to  dealing  with  two-part 
German  codes.  But  it  recovered  quickly  and,  with  Dejardin  playing  a leading 
role,  reconstituted  it  sufficiently  to  read  most  messages.  As  the  number  of 
codes  multiplied,  their  successful  solution  depended  increasingly  on  accurate 
traffic  analysis— an  accurate  separation  of  the  messages  of  one  army  from 
those  of  another.  This  was  managed,  and  the  French  soon  were  straining  to 
recover  the  first  100  or  150  groups  of  each  code  as  quickly  as  possible,  for 
with  this  entry  the  rapid  filling  out  of  the  repertory  was  virtually  assured. 
Most  of  the  30  German  codes  that  France  solved  during  the  war  must  have 
been  Satzbucher.  The  information  obtained  during  the  ten  days  from  Decem- 
ber 5 to  15,  1917,  a period  picked  at  random,  illustrates  the  value  of  the 
cryptanalysis:  discovery  of  four  division  movements,  reconfirmation  of  the 
identity  of  32  regiments,  ascertainment  of  the  presence  of  a counterattack 
division  north  of  St.  Quentin,  and  warning  of  a German  surprise  attack  at  the 
Abia  farm,  which  the  alerted  French  troops  repulsed. 

In  March  of  1918,  the  British  predicted  that  the  Germans  would  soon 
change  their  trench  codes,  probably  in  the  direction  of  enciphered  code. 
Painvin  and  Cartier  were  discussing  this  possibility  with  a visitor  when  Pain- 
vin  was  called  to  the  telephone.  French  G.H.Q.  informed  him  that  what 
appeared  to  be  that  very  switch  had  been  made  that  day  over  the  entire  front, 
replacing  the  Befehlstafel  trench  code.  The  basis  of  the  new  system  was  the 
Schliisselheft  (“keybook”),  a caption  code  of  1,000  three-digit  groups.  Only 
the  first  two  digits  of  each  codegroup  were  enciphered.  This  was  done  with  a 
Geheimklappe  (“secret  flyleaf”),  a 10  x 10  table  with  placode  digits  0 to  9 as 


316 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


coordinates  on  the  top  and  side  and  the  encicode  digits  dispersed  irregularly 
inside.  Toward  the  end  of  the  war,  the  Geheimklappe  changed  daily. 

Though  the  cruel  deadlock  of  the  Western  Front  riveted  the  major  atten- 
tions of  the  Entente  and  of  Germany,  its  chief  antagonist,  battles  on  the 
Eastern  and  the  Southern  Fronts  sacrificed  their  millions  as  well  to  the  clash 
of  national  ambitions.  Russia,  isolated  by  the  cruise  of  the  Goben , hurled  her 
mighty  forces  against  the  German  and  Austro-Hungarian  empires  time  and 
again  in  noble  resolution  of  her  treaty  obligations;  her  eventual  downfall,  in 
no  small  degree  a matter  of  cryptology,  is  a story  in  itself.  In  May  of  1915, 
Italy  denounced  its  treaty  with  the  Central  Powers  and  joined  the  Allies; 
Rumania  followed  a year  later.  Bulgaria  lined  up  with  Germany;  Greece  and 
Portugal  with  the  Entente.  Fighting  blasted  the  Holy  Land.  All  Europe  and 
the  Near  East  flamed. 

Thanks  to  its  prewar  training,  the  Austro-Hungarian  Army’s  Dechif- 
frierdienst  handily  unwrapped  the  Russian  systems,  aided  by  the  innumerable 
confusions  of  mobilization.  They  had  gained  almost  a year  of  invaluable  war- 
time experience  by  the  time  hostilities  broke  out  with  Italy.  Thus  they  achieved 
their  first  solutions  of  Italian  cryptograms  (of  no  tactical  importance)  on 
June  5,  1915,  only  13  days  after  the  declaration  of  war.  These  first  four  were 
followed  by  16  others  in  June,  most  intercepted  by  the  new  station  erected  at 
Marburg.  On  July  5,  the  Austrians  picked  up  their  first  dispatch  in  the  cifrario 
rosso  (“red  cipher”),  the  Italian  staff  cipher,  which  intelligence  chief  Ronge 
had  prudently  acquired  before  the  war.  They  had  the  odd  pleasure  of  reading 
a reprimand  from  General  Luigi  Cadorna,  the  Italian  commander  in  chief,  to 
Lieutenant  General  Frugoni  for  not  having  pressed  an  attack  vigorously 
enough. 

Five  days  later,  the  cifrario  rosso  key  changed.  The  Italian  specialists 
among  the  Austrian  cryptanalysts,  spearheaded  by  the  chief  of  the  entire 
cryptanalytic  section,  Major  Andreas  Figl,  cracked  it  only  after  considerable 
work.  The  number  of  solutions  fell  to  13  in  July.  But  as  the  Austrians 
accustomed  themselves  to  Italian  methods,  their  successes  waxed.  By  August 
12,  they  had  read  63  messages  and  could  send  the  new  key  to  the  several  army 
headquarters,  where  Figl  had  just  stationed  cryptanalysts.  Captain  Albert  de 
Carlo  was  assigned  to  Bozen ; Lieutenant  Alfred,  Baron  von  Chiari,  went  to  the 
11th  Army  at  Adelsburg  in  the  Tyrol  and  Lieutenant  Hugo  Scheuble  to 
the  10th  Army  at  Villach  in  Carinthia.  Soon  afterwards  the  Austrians 
captured  the  enemy’s  field  radio  instructions,  and  thereupon  the  number  of 
solutions  mounted  to  50  and  sometimes  70  a day.  Though  these  usually 
contained  only  administrative  matters,  they  enabled  Colonel  Ronge  to  predict 
the  course  of  impending  offensives. 

By  now  the  Austrian  cryptanalysts  had  become  so  expert  that  they  hardly 
noticed  the  changing  every  six  weeks  of  the  key  of  the  field  cipher,  the  cifrario 
servizio  (“service  cipher”).  In  October,  the  Italians  put  into  front-line  service 


317 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I 

a new  system,  the  cifrario  tascabile  (“pocket  cipher”),  and  Ronge  boasted 
that  “it  was  another  one  of  my  peacetime  purchases  that  was  already  paying 
for  itself.”  For  once  Ronge  was  wrong:  it  had  been  a complete  waste  of 
money.  The  cifrario  tascabile  was  no  more  or  less  than  a Vigenere  with  the 
digits  1 to  0 tacked  on  to  the  end  of  the  plaintext  alphabet  and  with  cipher 
alphabets  consisting  of  the  digits  10  to  45  in  normal  order!  Passwords  usually 
served  as  keys.  It  should  have  taken  the  experienced  Austrian  cryptanalysts 
perhaps  three  or  four  hours  at  the  most  to  identify  and  solve  the  first  message 
or  two  in  the  system. 

This  system  was  the  brainchild  of  Felice  de  Chaurand  de  Saint-Eustache, 
an  Italian  colonel  who  before  the  war  had  laboriously  solved  a correspond- 
ence carried  on  alternately  in  two  enciphered  commercial  codes,  the  Sittler 
and  the  Mengarini.  Subsequently  he  “enhanced”  his  cryptologic  reputation 
by  devising  the  cifrario  tascabile.  It  should  have  rather  brutally  exposed  his 
ignorance — and  it  reflects  badly  on  the  poverty  of  prewar  Italian  cryptology 
that  it  did  not.  Anyone  having  the  slightest  acquaintance  with  the  field  would 
have  seen  the  vulnerability  of  the  cifrario  tascabile,  while  anyone  who  had 
kept  up  with  the  literature  would  have  known  that  de  Chaurand  could  have 
solved  his  code  correspondence  in  a few  hours  if  he  had  applied  Valerio’s 
mechanical  technique  instead  of  requiring  the  two  months  of  several  hours’ 
work  a day  that  he  said,  rather  pridefully,  it  took  him.  Later,  for  some 
inexplicable  reason,  an  Italian  expeditionary  force  in  Albania  corresponded 
in  this  very  same  Mengarini  code ! 

During  the  big  Austrian  drive  in  the  spring  of  1916,  Austrian  cryptanalysts 
preyed  not  only  on  the  cifrario  tascabile,  which  was  an  easy  killing,  but  on  the 
other  systems  as  well.  One  radiogram  was  intercepted  during  the  evening  of 
May  20;  by  3 the  next  morning  Figl’s  group  had  read  of  arrangements  for  a 
heavy  counterattack  with  reserves;  by  4 countermeasures  had  been  ordered 
which  checked  the  Italian  onslaught.  On  June  1,  the  armies’  intercept- 
cryptanalytic  posts — which  Ronge  had  codenamed  “Penkalas,”  after  a pencil 
factory’s  trademark  that  showed  a head  with  a mechanical  pencil  behind  an 
oversized  ear — detected  a change  in  Italian  call-signs  and  cipher  key.  Four 
days  later,  a new  call-sign  was  heard  which  later  proved  to  be  that  of  a newly 
formed  Italian  5th  Army.  On  June  8,  the  Italian  1st  Army  cipher  key 
changed,  and  the  air  force  got  its  own  code.  The  Nachrichtenabteilung  put 
these  indications  all  together  and  they  spelled  “attack.”  Consequently  the 
Austrians  were  prepared  for  the  Italians’  summer  offensives  on  the  Isonzo 
River.  The  cryptanalysts  soon  became  so  expert  that  the  now-daily  Italian 
key  changes  caused  less  trouble  to  them  than  to  the  legitimate  decipherers. 
And  when  a new  system  was  introduced  on  August  20,  they  cracked  it  within 
38  hours. 

Cryptanalysis  had  thus  become  one  of  the  major  sources  of  Austrian 
intelligence,  and  by  April  of  1917,  the  organization  that  generated  this  in- 
formation had  burgeoned  into  a multisection  outfit.  Attached  to  the  general

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


staff’s  Evidenzgruppe  were  Chiffrengruppe  I,  under  Captain  de  Carlo,  and 
Chiffrengruppe  II,  under  Captain  Richard  Imme.  Theoretically  under  the 
Evidenzgruppe,  but,  according  to  Colonel  Ronge  (who  commanded  both), 
the  “real”  Austrian  intelligence  service,  was  the  Nachrichtenabteilung  of 
G.H.Q.  at  Baden.  One  of  its  five  divisions  was  the  Kriegschiffregruppe  (“War 
Cipher  Group”),  headed  by  First  Lieutenant  Hermann  Pokorny,  a brilliant 
cryptanalyst  who  had  solved  the  first  Russian  cryptogram  of  the  war,  and 
who  later  became  chief  of  the  Evidenzgruppe.  The  Kriegschiffregruppe  had 
three  sections:  an  Italian  under  Major  Figl  (who  later  rose  to  colonel),  a 
Rumanian  under  Captain  Kornelius  Savu,  and  a Russian  under  Captain 
Viktor  von  Marchesetti.  Feeding  intercepts  to  them  were  three  major 
Penkalas:  Austro-West,  covering  the  Italian  sector;  Austro-Sud,  the  Ruman- 
ian; and  Austro-Nord,  the  Russian.  The  entire  complex  was  referred  to  by 
the  unofficial  title  “Dechiffrierdienst.” 

Savu’s  group,  incidentally,  made  little  progress  for  a while  after  Rumania’s 
entry  into  the  war  in  1916,  but  then  the  ciphers  caved  in  and  proved  a mine 
of  information,  giving  the  Austrians  full  warning,  for  example,  of  a planned 
counterattack  on  September  14.  Captain  Franz  Jansa,  in  charge  of  Austro- 
Sud,  and  his  assistant,  Captain  Konstantin  Marosan,  found  themselves  so 
overworked  that  a cryptanalyst  had  to  be  attached  to  1st  Army  headquarters. 
Later  the  flood  slackened,  but  on  occasion  the  Austrians  read  messages  that 
the  intended  recipients  could  not,  showing  that  they  had  not  lost  their  touch. 

They  did  not  capture  all  the  laurels,  however.  Italy  had  made  no  pre- 
war cryptographic  purchases,  but  she  was  aided  in  her  efforts  to  catch  up  to 
her  enemy  by  some  remarkably  inept  Austrian  cryptography  and  some 
remarkably  able  Italian  cryptanalysts. 

The  first  and  best  of  these  was  Luigi  Sacco,  an  enthusiastic,  32-year-old 
lieutenant  of  engineers  at  the  Supreme  Command’s  radio  station.  He  had 
first  become  interested  in  cryptography  in  191 1,  at  the  time  of  Italy’s  war  with 
Turkey.  When,  during  the  World  War,  France  rebuffed  his  attempts  to  learn 
about  Central  Powers  cryptography  and  then  failed  to  send  back  solutions  of 
the  Austrian  intercepts  that  Italy  was  giving  her,  Sacco,  who  had  charge  of 
the  intercept  service,  began  to  attack  the  messages  himself.  Though  he  knew 
no  German,  he  chipped  away  so  energetically  and  acutely  that  he  soon 
managed  to  hack  out  fragments  of  plaintext.  These  proved  valuable  enough 
for  him  to  be  placed  in  charge  of  a cryptanalytic  office  attached  to  the 
Supreme  Command’s  intelligence  service.  Called  the  “Reparto  crittografico” 
(“cryptographic  unit”),  it  was  staffed  at  first  with  two  engineers  from  Irre- 
dentist areas  of  Austria — Tullio  Cristofolini  of  Trent  and  Mario  Franzotti  of 
Gorizia— and  with  a distinguished  linguist,  Professor  Remo  Fedi.  It  employed 
several  score  of  people  by  the  end  of  the  war. 

The  cryptanalysts  achieved  their  first  complete  solution  of  Austro- 
Hungarian  radiograms  during  the  Battle  of  Gorizia  in  August  of  1917.  What 


A War  of  Intercepts:  I ^19 

systems  were  then  in  use  are  unspecified.  But  up  to  that  time  the  Austrians 
had  not  displayed  any  singular  excellence  in  their  cryptography.  Among  the 
systems  in  which  they  had  reposed  their  trust  and  their  lives  was  a Vigenere 
with  alphabets  normal  except  for  the  addition  of  a,  o,  and  ii  a circumstance 
that  perhaps  explains  Ronge's  vaunting  of  his  purchase  of  the  closely  similar 
cifrario  tascabile.  There  were  also  what  the  Italians  called  the  ak  and  the  sh, 
in  which  50-odd  ciphertext  digrams  represented  a plaintext  letter,  number,  or 
syllable.  The  ak  was  sent  in  its  original  two-letter  groups,  whereas  the  sh  was 
divided  into  five-letter  groups.  Not  till  November,  1917,  did  the  Austrians 
convert  to  codes,  when  they  placed  into  service  what  the  Italians  called  the 
cw  and  the  Carnia  codes,  both  of  1,000  groups  and  for  use  only  withm  a single 
army.  The  Reparto  crittografico  solved  them  both. 

It  also  solved  a similar  code  on  the  basis  of  a single  message  in  the  crucial 
days  just  before  the  Battle  of  the  Piave.  As  part  of  the  preparations  for  their 
summer  push,  the  Austrians  had  placed  a two-part  code  of  1,000  groups  into 
service  on  June  15,  1918.  At  first  they  used  it  correctly,  but  soon  repetitions 
appeared  that  indicated  letter-by-letter  encoding,  with  groups  exceeding  the 
frequency  of  4 or  5 per  cent  that  would  be  the  normal  maximum  for  word- 
groups  in  such  a code.  On  June  20,  Italy  intercepted  two  messages  with 
virtually  the  same  unusual  ending: 

492  073  065  834  729  589  255  073  255  834  729  264 

The  pattern  of  repetitions  suggested  the  plaintext  radiostation,  with  the  two 
partial  repeats  073  ..  . 834  729  representing  the  repeated  a-io  and  the  two 
255s  standing  for  the  repeated  t.  It  checked  out,  and  thus  this  one  lazy  Austrian 
code  clerk,  who  found  it  easier  to  encode  letter  by  letter  than  to  hunt  up  the 
codegroups  for  radio  and  station,  had  enabled  the  Italians  to  read  a goodly 
portion  of  his  comrades’  code  communications. 

Italy’s  growing  cryptanalytic  experience  enabled  it  to  solve  increasingly 
difficult  problems,  such  as  the  superenciphered  Austrian  diplomatic  code  (for 
which  Sacco’s  group  had  the  aid  of  cleartext  messages).  The  considerably 
larger  naval  cryptanalytic  staff  solved  the  Austrians’  superenciphered  naval 
system.  And  gradually  it  dawned  on  the  Italians  that  if  they  could  read 
Austrian  ciphers,  perhaps  the  Austrians  could  read  theirs.  As  early  as  January, 
1917,  an  attempt  was  made  to  replace  the  old  systems.  It  foundered  on  the 
complaint  that  the  new  methods  required  too  much  time  for  encipherment. 
Later,  improvements  were  made  to  the  cifrario  rosso,  but  these  were  quickly 
nullified  when  a major  army  unit  transmitted  the  new  key  variables  in  the  old 
system.  In  June,  the  cifrario  tascabile  was  replaced  by  a small  codebook,  and 
after  the  bloody  Italian  defeat  at  Caporetto,  there  was  a wholesale  change  of 
army  systems,  to  enciphered  code.  At  about  the  same  time,  Cartier  journeyed 
to  Italy,  visiting  the  intercept  posts  and  talking  with  Sacco.  The  Allied 
military  mission  that  bolstered  Italy  at  the  end  of  1917  included  some 


320

cryptologic  personnel.  All  of  this  noticeably  tightened  Italian  cryptologic 
practice. 

As  a result,  Austrian  cryptanalyses  declined  sharply  in  the  latter  half  of 
the  war.  Nevertheless,  Austria-Hungary  had  enjoyed  the  preponderance  of 
cryptanalytic  success  on  the  Southern  Front.  Ronge  always  cherished  as  the 
greatest  tribute  to  his  Dechiffrierdienst  an  unintended  one  from  the  foe.  A 
postwar  commission  of  enquiry  into  the  Caporetto  disaster  reported  with 
anguish  that  “The  enemy  had  known  and  deciphered  all  our  codes,  even  the 
most  difficult  and  most  secret.”

A WAR  OF  INTERCEPTS:  II 


nineteen  eleven  is  not  a momentous  year  in  American  history.  The  last 
two  territories  on  the  continent,  New  Mexico  and  Arizona,  were  preparing 
for  admission  to  the  Union.  The  large-girthed  William  Howard  Taft  lumbered 
about  the  White  House,  trying  to  ignore  the  pyrotechnics  of  his  predecessor, 
Theodore  Roosevelt.  C.  P.  Rodgers  made  the  first  airplane  flight  across  the 
country.  Carry  Nation  died.  Perhaps  the  most  impressive  event  of  the  twelve- 
month  was  Ty  Cobb’s  batting  that  incredible  .420.  The  year  was  not  out- 
standing, but  it  was  the  year  in  which  the  United  States  took  its  first  faltering 
steps  in  official  military  cryptanalysis. 

They  were  taken  at  Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas.  Here  America’s  tiny  pre- 
war Army  had  its  Signal  School.  In  191 1,  the  school  began  a series  of  technical 
conferences,  and  on  December  20  portions  of  a paper  on  “Military  Crypto- 
graphy” by  Captain  Murray  Muirhead  of  Britain’s  Royal  Field  Artillery  were 
read  to  Conference  No.  4.  The  students  responded  with  some  papers  of  their 
own.  Captain  Alvin  C.  Voris  showed  how  unsuitable  the  purely  administra- 
tive War  Department  Telegraph  Code  was  for  troops  in  the  field  and  proposed 
a tactical  supplement  for  it.  Lieutenant  Frederick  F.  Black  praiseworthily 
made  an  attempt  to  mechanize  en-  and  deciphering  by  putting  caps  over 
typewriter  keys.  Lieutenant  Karl  Truesdell  took  a basic  first  step  by  compiling 
10,000-letter  frequency  tables  for  English,  German,  French,  Italian,  Spanish, 
and  Portuguese.  A few  months  later.  Lieutenant  Joseph  O.  Mauborgne — who 
was  to  become  Chief  Signal  Officer — whiled  away  the  long  hours  of  a trans- 
pacific crossing  by  solving  an  814-letter  Playfair  from  Muirhead ; he  described 
his  methods  in  1914  in  a 19-page  pamphlet  that  is  the  first  published  solution 
of  that  cipher. 

The  Muirhead  seed  ripened  best  in  the  fertile  mind  of  a 34-year-old 
captain  of  infantry  named  Parker  Hitt.  Hitt  was  the  towering  figure  of  Ameri- 
can cryptology  in  those  days,  both  figuratively  and  literally.  Six  feet  four 
inches  tall,  a native  of  Indianapolis,  he  had  left  his  studies  in  civil  engineering 
at  Purdue  University  in  1898  to  join  the  Army.  He  served  in  Cuba,  won  a 
commission,  and  saw,  if  not  the  world,  at  least  the  Philippines,  Alaska,  and 
California.  After  graduating  from  the  Signal  School,  he  stayed  on  as  an 
instructor.  Hitt  participated  in  the  technical  conferences  .and,  among  other 

321

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


things,  demonstrated  the  insecurity  of  Black’s  typewriter  method  by  taking 
only  45  minutes  to  solve  one  of  the  automatic  cryptograms. 

He  discovered  that  he  was  “very  much  interested  in  cipher  work  of  all 
kinds”  and  that  he  had  a real  knack  for  it.  When  the  border  command  began 
intercepting  Mexican  cipher  messages  as  American  friction  grew  with  that 
troubled  country,  the  messages  found  their  way  to  Hitt.  Soon  he  was  solving 
transposition  ciphers,  monalphabetics,  polyalphabetics  (some  with  mixed 
alphabets)  used  by  agents  of  Pancho  Villa  and  others,  and  a homophonic 
substitution  used  by  the  Constitutionalists.  This  had  four  numerical  cipher 
alphabets,  all  of  which  remained  fixed  during  the  encipherment  of  a single 
message,  but  whose  positions  were  changed  from  one  message  to  another. 
The  key  could  be  indicated  by  the  letters  above  the  lowest  number  in  each 
alphabet,  or  by  the  four  numbers  under  A.  For  example,  the  arrangement  used 
for  a message  between  Saltillo  and  Juarez,  intercepted  on  November  26,  1916, 
was: 

ABCDEFGHI  J KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 

24  25  26  01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23 

41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40 

56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  53  54  55 

99  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98 

Hitt  solved  this,  and  many  like  it.  The  system  later  became  more  widely  known 
under  the  name  of  the  Mexican  Army  Cipher  Disk  when  the  four  numerical 
alphabets  were  placed  on  revolving  disks. 

Hitt  demonstrated  his  acuity  in  cryptanalysis  nowhere  more  strikingly 
than  with  a subtle  numerical  system  forwarded  him  by  Lieutenant  Colonel 
Samuel  Reber  of  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Signal  Officer.  Reber  wrote  him  on 
September  21,  1915:  “Some  time  ago  while  in  conversation  with  the  Assistant 
Chief  Engineer  of  the  Western  Electric  Company,  I told  him  that  a good 
cipher  expert  could  work  out  almost  any  cipher,  and  his  letter  of  August  3rd 
shows  what  he  thinks  in  the  matter.  I am  sending  you  the  ciphers.  . . .”  On  the 
24th,  Hitt,  then  at  the  School  of  Musketry  at  Fort  Sill,  Oklahoma,  received 
the  cryptograms,  which  were  two  strings  of  unbroken  numbers,  and  the  next 
day,  a rainy  Saturday,  analyzed  them.  That  afternoon  he  wrote  Reber: 

“No.  1 consisted  of  415  figures  and  the  factors  of  this  are  83  x 5.  This  led 
to  the  conclusion  that  I had  five  figure  groups  to  deal  with  and  this  was  checked 
affirmatively  when  I made  out  a list  of  these  groups  and  found  some  duplicates 
and  a few  triplicates.  The  ratio  of  occurrence  of  these  duplicates  and  tripli- 
cates led  me  at  once  to  the  conclusion  that  each  group  represented  two  letters. 

“The  groups  ran  in  value  from  00518  to  53339  with  large  gaps.  I then  made 
the  small  graph  of  group  values  and  found  that  I could  roughly  superimpose  a 
normal  frequency  table  on  the  graph,  but  the  scale,  if  I may  so  call  it,  was 
larger  at  the  A end  than  at  the  Z end.  This  suggested  a logarithmic  scale  and  I 
reached  for  a table  of  logarithms. 


323 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

“00518  showed  up  as  log  1012  and  53339  as  log  3415  exactly.  If  A = 10, 
then  12  = C,  34  = Y and  15  = F.  The  rest  of  the  solution  merely  involved 
the  use  of  the  logarithm  table  on  these  five  figure  groups  and  the  reduction  of 
the  numerals  so  found  to  letters.”  In  a few  swift  slashes  of  his  mind  he  thus 
cracked  an  ingenious  two-step  cipher,  to  Reber’s  pleasure  (though  he  un- 
graciously said  he  could  have  done  it  himself  if  he  tried)  and  to  the  chagrin  of 
the  Western  Electric  assistant  chief  engineer. 

During  1915  Hitt  was  working  on  a project  that  he  had  mentioned  in  a 
letter  to  Reber  on  January  15:  “I  have  a mass  of  material  on  cipher  work,  the 
accumulation  of  the  last  four  years,  and  hope  to  put  it  into  shape  as  a pamph- 
let before  I leave  here  if  time  permits.  Major  Wildman  has  kindly  suggested 
that  I do  this  in  order  that  the  pamphlet  be  used  as  a basis  for  the  course  in 
cipher  work.”  He  enriched  his  own  experience — greater  than  that  of  any  other 
person  in  the  country  at  that  time — with  theory  and  new  information  from 
European  books  on  cryptology  that  he  borrowed  from  the  Army  War  College. 
He  finally  completed  his  booklet  late  in  1915,  and  the  next  year  the  Press 
of  the  Army  Service  Schools  at  Fort  Leavenworth  published  4,000  copies  of 
his  Manual  for  the  Solution  of  Military  Ciphers,  selling  it  at  35  cents  the 
copy. 

It  was  an  excellent  work.  It  naturally  explained  how  to  solve  the  standard 
ciphers,  up  to  periodic  polyalphabetics  with  mixed  alphabets  and — for  per- 
haps the  first  time  in  the  literature  of  cryptology — combined  transposition- 
substitution.  But  its  special  merit  lay  in  its  practical  tone.  The  book  was 
imbued  with  a verisimilitude,  an  air  of  this-is-how-things-really-are,  that  stem- 
med largely  from  Hitt’s  grounding  in  the  realities  of  signal  communication. 
This  pragmatic  approach  cropped  up,  for  example,  in  the  book’s  discussions 
of  why  cryptanalytic  offices  should  be  attached  to  field  headquarters  and  how 
they  should  be  organized,  of  the  need  for  accurate  intercept  and  recording 
procedures  and  how  they  may  be  achieved,  and  of  how  to  correct  errors  in 
enciphering  and  transmission — a subject  of  the  utmost  practical  importance 
and  one  almost  invariably  neglected  in  treatises.  Hitt  replaced  the  waxen 
examples  of  other  books  with  real  cryptograms,  several  with  Spanish  plain- 
texts, whose  presence,  in  view  of  the  Pershing  punitive  expedition,  intensified 
the  feeling  of  reality.  As  a military  man,  Hitt  wrote  with  directness;  as  one 
with  an  extra  measure  of  intelligence,  he  wrote  with  clarity;  and  as  one  with  a 
touch  of  the  poet,  he  flavored  his  101  pages  with  a prairie  tang  all  his  own. 
“As  to  luck,”  he  observed  when  discussing  the  fourth  of  four  factors  that 
determine  success  in  cryptanalysis  (the  others  being  perseverance,  careful 
analysis  and  intuition),  “there  is  the  old  miner’s  proverb:  ‘Gold  is  where  you 
find  it.’  ” 

Yet  the  book  was  outdated  at  the  moment  of  its  birth.  Events  in  Europe 
had  far  outrun  its  elementary  notions.  Cryptograms  were  no  longer  being 
solved  on  the  basis  of  single  messages,  as  in  Hitt's  examples.  Military  ciphers 
had  long  since  attained  a complexity  never  hinted  at  in  the  Manual.  The

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

French  had  anticipated  his  ideas  on  cryptanalytic  organizations.  The  Spanish- 
language  examples  might  better  have  been  German.  And  in  view  of  the  trench 
codes  which  were  then  emerging  as  the  dominant  form  of  cryptography,  one 
sentence  was  singularly  inapt:  “The  necessity  for  exact  expression  of  ideas 
practically  excludes  the  use  of  codes  for  military  work  although,”  he  hedged, 
“it  is  possible  that  a special  tactical  code  might  be  useful  for  preparation  of 
tactical  orders.” 

All  this  is  true.  Yet  it  remains  equally  true  that  the  book  filled  a real  need. 
Many  people,  struck  by  the  interest  in  these  matters  that  war  always  enlarges, 
wanted  to  know  about  cryptology.  But  the  United  States  was  achingly  devoid 
of  information:  Hitt’s  was,  in  surprising  fact,  the  first  book  on  the  subject 
published  in  America*— and  indeed  the  first  devoted  to  cryptanalysis  in 
English  since  Philip  Thicknesse’s  1772  A Treatise  on  the  Art  of  Decypher ing\ 
Soldiers  and  civilians  grabbed  at  it.  A second  edition  became  necessary,  and 
this  time  16,000  paperbound  copies  were  run  off,  giving  it  a greater  circulation 
than  any  previous  book  in  the  history  of  cryptology.  Elementary  it  may  have 
been,  but  for  those  who  knew  nothing  of  the  subject,  a basic  work  was  what 
was  needed.  When  the  United  States  declared  war,  Hitt’s  Manual  served  as 
the  textbook  to  train  future  cryptanalysts  of  the  American  Expeditionary 
Forces.  Some  of  this  training  was  done  at  the  Army  War  College  in  Washing- 
ton under  the  auspices  of  MI-8,  the  cryptologic  section  (number  8)  of  the 
Military  Intelligence  Division,  headed  by  Herbert  O.  Yardley,  and  some  at  the 
Riverbank  Laboratories  in  Geneva,  Illinois,  where  cryptologic  research, 
mainly  aimed  at  proving  that  Bacon  wrote  Shakespeare,  had  been  carried  on 
since  before  the  war.  Riverbank  also  had  some  texts  of  its  own. 

In  doing  the  research  for  his  book,  Hitt  ran  across  a military  cipher  that 
greatly  impressed  him  as  affording  more  security  than  any  other  that  he  knew. 
He,  and  probably  all  the  other  young  cryptanalysts  at  the  Signal  School, 
stood  aghast  at  what  was  then  the  “official”  U.S.  Army  field  cipher.  This  was 
the  Signal  Corps  cipher  disk,  a celluloid  device  with  a reversed  cipher  alphabet 
revolving  inside  a standard  plaintext  alphabet.  The  Army  used  it  with  a 
repeating  keyword  to  produce  a straight  periodic  Beaufort  cipher.  It  was 
equivalent  to  the  Confederate  cipher  disk  of  50  years  before  and  inferior  to 
the  cipher  disk  described  by  Porta  three  centuries  before  that— a record  of 
retrogression  unmatched,  perhaps,  by  any  science  in  the  world.  Even  though 
the  cipher  disk  was  the  “official”  system,  Hitt’s  own  2nd  Division  used  a then- 
popular  cipher  called  the  “Larrabee.”  It  was  simply  an  ordinary  Vigenere 
printed  so  that  the  plaintext  alphabet  was  repeated  for  all  26  cipher  alphabets. 
Neither  it  nor  the  cipher  disk  would  have  delayed  an  expert  cryptanalyst  for 
more  than  an  hour.  On  May  19,  1914,  Hitt  had  recommended  that  the 
Larrabee  be  replaced  by  the  Playfair  as  the  2nd  Division  cipher,  but  was 

* The  only  previous  works  on  cryptology  to  appear  in  the  United  States  were  magazine 
or  encyclopedia  articles  and  two  pamphlets — Mauborgne’s  and  a totally  obscure  work  of 
31  pages  by  one  Harvey  Gray,  entitled  Cryptography  and  published  at  Boston  in  1874.

turned  down.  Undaunted,  he  proposed  the  new  cipher  that  impressed  him 
so  much  to  the  director  of  the  Army  Signal  School  on  December  19, 
1914. 

“This  device  is  based,  to  a certain  extent,  on  the  ideas  of  Commandant 
Bazeries,  of  the  French  Army,”  he  wrote  in  his  memorandum.  Hitt  in  effect 
peeled  the  alphabets  off  the  disks  of  the  Bazeries  cylinder  and  stretched  them 
out  in  strip  form.  He  cut  25  long  slips  of  paper,  printed  a mixed  alphabet  on 
each  of  them  twice,  numbered  them,  and  then  arranged  them  in  a holder  in 
the  order  given  by  a keynumber.  To  encipher,  he  slid  the  slips  up  or  down 
until  they  spelled  out  the  first  20  letters  of  the  message  in  a horizontal  line, 
and  then  selected  any  other  line,  or  generatrix,  as  the  ciphertext,  repeating  this 
process  until  the  entire  message  was  enciphered.  Hitt’s  first  holder  was  7x3^ 
inches.  He  also  made  the  device  in  its  original  Jefferson-Bazeries  form  by 
sawing  disks  off  a cylinder  of  apple  wood. 

He  requested  that  the  device  be  forwarded  to  the  Chief  Signal  Officer. 
About  1917,  his  old  fellow  student  at  the  Signal  School,  Joseph  Mauborgne, 
then  in  charge  of  the  Signal  Corps  Engineering  and  Research  Division,  fixed 
the  device  in  the  cylindrical  form  for  the  Army  and  mixed  the  alphabets  much 
more  thoroughly  than  Hitt  had,  thereby  making  solution  more  difficult.  In 
1922,  the  Army  issued  its  m-94,  which  strung  25  aluminum  disks  the  size  of  a 
silver  dollar  on  a spindle  4\  inches  long.  The  m-94  remained  in  Army  service 
until  early  in  World  War  II.  Between  the  wars,  both  the  Coast  Guard  and  the 
Radio  Intelligence  Division  of  the  Federal  Communications  Commission 
made  use  of  it.  In  the  1930s,  the  Army  reverted  to  Hitt’s  slide  form  in  its 
cipher  device  m-138-a,  which  improved  on  the  Hitt  device  by  providing  100 
slides,  30  of  which  were  used  at  a time.  The  State  Department  adopted  the 
m-138-a  in  the  late  1930s  and  early  1940s  as  its  most  secret  method  of  com- 
munication. The  Navy  likewise  used  it  very  widely  in  World  War  II.  It  was 
commonly  called  the  “strip  system.”  Thus  Hitt’s  few  paper  slides  became 
one  of  the  most  widely  used  systems  in  the  history  of  American  cryptography. 

In  1917,  Hitt  went  to  France  with  Pershing’s  staff  as  assistant  to  the  Chief 
Signal  Officer.  When  the  A.E.F’s  1st  Army  was  formed,  Hitt  became  its 
Chief  Signal  Officer.  Though  there  was  no  cryptology  involved  in  this  job,  his 
book  had  made  him  the  American  expert  on  the  subject,  and  his  advice  was 
often  sought.  It  was  even  followed,  since  Hitt  was  widely  respected. 

While  he  was  overseas,  his  wife,  Genevieve,  who  was  operating  the  code 
room  at  Fort  Sam  Houston  in  San  Antonio,  struck  up  a friendship  with  a 
young  lieutenant  and  his  wife  who  lived  across  the  way.  Their  names  were 
Dwight  and  Mamie  Eisenhower,  and  the  friendship  of  the  two  families 
stretched  across  the  years.  One  morning  during  World  War  II  the  Hitts 
stumbled  across  Ike,  stretched  out  asleep  in  the  living  room  of  their  home  in 
Front  Royal,  Virginia,  and  in  the  1950s  Parker  Hitt  attended  one  of  the 
famous  and  exclusive  stag  dinners  given  by  the  President  at  the  White 
House.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


When  the  United  States  entered  the  war,  its  Army  had  no  official  code- 
making or  codebreaking  agency.  Codes  were  occasionally  compiled,  of 
course,  and  each  unit  seemed  to  prescribe  its  own  field  ciphers,  as  Hitt  found 
out  when  he  tried  to  replace  the  Larrabee  with  the  Playfair.  Any  cryptanalysis 
was  on  a strictly  informal  basis,  like  the  messages  that  were  sent  to  Hitt,  often 
with  a request  like  that  from  the  acting  intelligence  officer  of  the  Southern 
Department  on  March  7,  1917:  “1.  The  inclosed  cipher  messages  have  been 
received  from  the  Chief  of  the  War  College  Division,  General  Staff.  2.  It  is 
requested  that  you  decipher  them  as  they  are  unable  to  do  it  in  Washington. 
3.  The  results  obtained  are  desired  at  the  earliest  practicable  date.”  (Hitt 
returned  these  on  March  10  saying  that  they  appeared  to  be  in  code  and  that 
he  could  not  read  them.)  Usually  Hitt  had  to  squeeze  this  work  in  among  his 
regular  duties.  The  Riverbank  Laboratories  also  did  some  informal  crypt- 
analysis for  the  War  Department. 

It  was  obvious,  upon  the  arrival  of  the  first  token  units  of  the  American 
Expeditionary  Force  in  France  in  the  spring  of  1917,  that  the  A.E.F.  would 
have  both  cryptographic  and  cryptanalytic  work  to  do.  Consequently, 
General  Orders  No.  8 of  July  5,  1917,  which  established  the  A.E.F.  head- 
quarters organization,  provided  for  these  functions.  It  assigned  “American 
codes  and  ciphers”  to  the  Signal  Corps  but  gave  “policy  regarding  prepara- 
tion and  issue  of  ciphers  and  trench  codes”  to  the  Intelligence  Division, 
probably  because  this  was  also  charged  with  “enemy’s  wireless  and  ciphers” 
and  “examining  of  enemy’s  ciphers.”  Having  the  cryptanalysts  supervise  the 
cryptographers  was  excellent  in  theory — and  it  worked  out  fine  in  practice. 
The  two  organizations  that  came  into  being  in  accordance  with  this  order 
collaborated  closely  throughout  the  war.  One  was  g.2  a. 6,  the  Radio  Intellig- 
ence Section  (the  6)  of  the  Military  Information  Division  (the  a)  of  the 
Intelligence  Section  (the  2)  of  the  General  Staff  (the  g).  The  other  was  the 
Code  Compilation  Section  of  the  Signal  Corps.  Both  were  stationed  at  Ameri- 
can G.  H.Q.  at  Chaumont,  a town  on  the  Marne  about  1 50  miles  east  of  Paris. 

The  Code  Compilation  Section  was  set  up  in  December  of  1917.  There  had 
been  no  real  need  for  it  before  then  because  the  United  States  had  no  troops  in 
the  line.  In  command  was  Howard  R.  Barnes,  a 40-year-old  Ohioan  who  had 
been  commissioned  a captain  because  of  his  ten  years  of  experience  in  the 
State  Department  code  room.  Under  him  were  three  lieutenants  and  a 
corporal.  The  unit  examined  and  discarded  the  three  means  of  secret  com- 
munications then  authorized  for  the  A.E.F. — the  War  Department  Telegraph 
Code,  which,  as  Voris  had  pointed  out,  was  unsuited  to  tactical  work,  the 
cipher  disk,  whose  security  was  nil,  and  the  Playfair,  which  could  not  sustain 
security  under  regular  use,  but  could  and  did  serve  as  an  emergency  system. 

Cryptography  on  the  Western  Front  had  evolved  through  ciphers  to 
codes,  and  Barnes,  bowing  to  this  experience,  began  the  task — never  before 
attempted  in  the  American  Army — of  compiling  a codebook  in  the  field.  His 
section  studied  an  obsolete  trench  code  that  the  British  had  reluctantly  turned 


327 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

over,  made  firsthand  observations  of  communication  needs  at  the  front,  and 
drew  up  The  American  Trench  Code,  of  1,600  elements,  and  the  Front-Line 
Code,  of  500.  Both  were  one-part  codes  to  be  used  with  a monoalphabetic 
superencipherment.  The  1,000  copies  of  the  Trench  Code  were  distributed  only 
down  to  regimental  headquarters,  and  the  3,000  copies  of  the  Front-Line  Code 
to  companies.  They  served  as  the  American  cryptosystems  during  the  first 
weeks  of  real  A.E.F.  participation  in  the  war — the  weeks  of  Chateau- 
Thierry  and  Belleau  Wood. 

But  the  system  of  enciphered  code  did  not  last  long.  Barnes  frequently 
consulted  with  Hitt— “To  him  more  than  to  any  other  officer  of  the  American 
Army  is  due  whatever  success  the  American  Codes  may  have  obtained,  he 
later  wrote — and  Hitt  suggested  testing  the  superencipherment,  g.2  a. 6 lent 
Lieutenant  J.  Rives  Childs.  On  May  17,  1918,  Childs  was  given  a copy  of  the 
codebook  and  44  superenciphered  messages.  Within  five  hours — three  of 
them  spent  just  in  making  frequency  counts — he  had  recovered  the  encipher- 
ment alphabet.  At  about  the  same  time,  Barnes  and  his  men  realized  that  a 
superencipherment  imposed  extra  delay  and  extra  work  upon  the  encoders  at 
the  front,  with  all  the  dangers  that  that  entailed.  Superenciphered  code  would 
have  to  be  junked.  But  what  would  the  A.E.F.  use? 

Barnes  was  in  close  contact  with  Major  Frank  Moorman,  chief  of 
g.2  a. 6,  and  it  may  have  been  Moorman  who  proposed  that  the  A.E.F.  use 
unenciphered  two-part  codes  changed  either  before  the  Germans  could  solve 
them— a period  estimated  at  from  two  to  four  weeks— or  upon  the  capture  of 
a book.  On  May  24,  Hitt  was  writing  to  Moorman:  “I  concur  in  your  ideas 
about  the  trench  code  book.  I believe  that  we  can  republish  it  every  two  weeks 
. . . .”  Barnes,  who  was  no  cryptanalyst,  acquiesced  in  the  views  of  those  who 
were.  Frequent  replacement  was  the  principle  of  the  Satzbuch,  but  the 
American  codes  were  intended  for  service  closer  to  the  front.  Thus  the  burden 
of  augmenting  security  was  lifted  from  the  front-line  soldiers  and  thrown,  in 
the  form  of  the  more  complicated  two-part  arrangement  and  the  rapid  replace- 
ment of  codes,  on  the  relatively  undistracted  personnel  at  headquarters. 

On  June  24,  1918,  the  Code  Compilation  Section  published  the  first  of  the 
superb  series  of  A.E.F.  field  codes— the  Potomac.  A 47-page  booklet,  it 
contained  about  1 ,800  words  and  phrases  for  tactical  needs  ( during  the  night  = 
anf,  machine  gun  ammunition  = apu).  About  2,000  copies  were  printed  and 
turned  over  to  g-2  for  distribution  as  far  down  as  battalion  headquarters. 
It  went  into  service  on  July  15.  The  Potomac  set  the  pattern  for  subsequent 
codes,  which  were  printed  and  held  in  reserve,  one  set  at  army  headquarters, 
a second  at  General  Headquarters.  Thus  when,  as  expected,  the  Potomac 
Code  was  captured  a few  weeks  after  its  publication,  it  took  only  two  days  to 
issue  the  Suwanee  to  the  entire  A.E.F.  The  Wabash  moved  into  place  as  the 
back-up  code  and  then,  16  days  later,  into  service.  It  was  followed  by  the 
Mohawk,  Allegheny,  Hudson,  and  Colorado  codes  at  intervals  of  3,  9,  21,  and 
22  days. 


328 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  rapid  growth  of  the  A.E.F.  necessitated  an  increase  in  the  number  of 
copies  printed  to  3,200,  but  this  also  increased  the  danger  of  capture.  So  with 
the  formation  of  the  2nd  Army,  a series  of  codes  named  for  lakes  was 
instituted  on  October  7 for  the  use  of  that  army,  while  the  river  series  was 
continued  for  the  1st  Army.  The  Champlain,  Huron,  Osage,  and  Seneca

Portions  of  the  encoding  and  decoding  sections  of  the  A.E.F.'s  Hudson  Code 


codes  were  issued  to  the  2nd  Army  at  intervals  of  8,  13,  and  9 days.  At  the 
Armistice,  the  Niagara  Code  was  in  press  and  the  Michigan  and  Rio  Grande 
codes  in  manuscript.  In  the  five  months  between  June  and  November,  the 
section  turned  out  nearly  three  codes  a month — a noteworthy  achievement, 
particularly  in  comparison  with  what  the  other  belligerents  accomplished. 


329 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

The  Code  Compilation  Section  printed  its  codes  under  conditions  of 
tightest  security  at  the  Adjutant  General’s  printing  office  at  Chaumont. 
Codes  took  priority  over  all  other  work  except  general  orders  and  bulletins. 
Under  favorable  conditions,  a field  code  would  go  from  manuscript  to  binder 
in  five  or  six  days.  Each  code  was  proofread  twice.  “During  the  process  of 
printing,”  Barnes  wrote,  “the  codes  were  under  the  constant  supervision  of 
an  officer  whose  duty  it  was  to  destroy  all  spoiled  sheets  containing  impres- 
sions even  to  the  mats  on  the  presses.  All  copies  were  counted  and  accounted 
for  and  the  metal  type  melted  down  after  the  final  impression.  In  many  cases, 
two  or  three  officers  were  on  duty  in  the  printing  office  keeping  the  various 
operations  in  sight.”  The  size  of  an  edition  was  determined  by  G-2.  Because 
the  courier  service  refused  to  carry  the  heavy  packages  of  codebooks,  g.2  a. 6, 
whose  personnel  realized  the  importance  of  secrecy  in  communications,  took 
over  the  actual  distribution  of  copies.  Officers  at  the  headquarters  where  the 
codes  were  kept  in  reserve  were  ordered  to  make  frequent  checks  of  the 
number  of  packages  and  the  seals  on  them.  A British  officer  was  dum- 
founded  when  he  heard  that  American  codes  could  be  prepared  in  ten  days, 
saying  that  it  would  take  his  army  at  least  a month. 

Their  cryptanalytic  resistance  was,  as  with  the  enciphered  code,  gauged  by 
actual  test.  This  time  the  results  were  positive.  Members  of  g.2  a. 6 reported 
that  the  system,  while  not  insoluble,  excelled  that  of  the  Germans.  Coded 
messages  had  been  sent  to  the  British  for  further  examination.  Hay  reported 
that  “We  have  not  been  able  to  solve  them  or  even  to  get  any  light.  The 
security  appears  of  a high  order.”  Hitchings  wrote:  “I  am  sending  you  a short 
survey  of  our  observations  on  the  41  messages.  ...  we  have  not  succeeded  in 
solving  them,  but  you  will  see  in  the  enclosed  survey  a few  possible  lines  of 
attack.”  And  while  Parker  Hitt  had  not  tried  to  solve  any  messages  in  the 
code,  his  general  experience  led  him  to  say,  “We  believe  that  this  code  system 
will  be  better  than  anything  now  in  use  on  either  side.” 

These  field  codes  served  primarily  for  communication  within  each  division, 
though  they  also  encoded  messages  between  divisions  and  to  higher  head- 
quarters. Battalions  on  the  flanks  of  each  army  exchanged  codebooks  to  per- 
mit intercommunication.  The  A.E.F.  supplemented  them  with  a variety  of 
others  needed  by  a modern  army  and  prepared  by  the  Code  Compilation 
Section.  Troops  in  the  very  first  trenches  used  the  Emergency  Code  List,  a 
single  sheet  with  about  50  common  expressions  represented  in  two-part 
arrangement  by  two-letter  groups  (cm  = message  not  understood-,  pv  =our 
artillery  is  shelling  us).  It  resembled  the  carnet  de  chiffre.  New  editions  were 
distributed  at  the  same  time  as  new  editions  of  the  field  codes.  For  head- 
quarters work  Barnes’  section  produced  1,000  copies  of  the  massive  Staff 
Code-.  30,400  words  and  phrases,  whose  four-letter  codewords,  in  one-part 
order,  were  superenciphered  digraphically,  with  different  tables  for  G-l,  g-2, 
g-3,  g-4,  and  g-5.  It  was  probably  the  largest  codebook  ever  printed  in  the 
field.  There  were  also  special  codes  for  reporting  casualties,  for  technical

Front-line  cryptography:  an  A.E.F.  code  list  issued  for  use  in  the  trenches 


radio  matters,  for  extra  secrecy  at  six  major  telegraph  posts  in  reporting  troop 
movements,  and  for  designating  the  names  of  organizations  and  officers  over 
the  telephone  by  using  women’s  names  as  jargon  ( 28th  Division  = jennie: 
Chief  of  Staff  = dow;  Chief  of  Staff  of  28th  Division  = jennie  dow).  In  its 
ten  months  of  active  work,  the  section  printed  more  than  80,000  codebooks 
and  pamphlets,  all  numbered,  recorded,  issued  and  receipted  for. 


331 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

In  addition  to  these  official  codes,  many  A.E.F.  units  cooked  up  their  own 
unauthorized  ones.  In  the  82nd  Division,  for  example,  officers  said  great 
neck  for  Grosreuves  and  buzzard  for  1st  Battalion,  326th  Infantry.  Some 
anonymous  but  avid  baseball  fail  in  the  52nd  Infantry  Brigade  produced  the 
gem  of  these  unofficial  systems.  If  we  were  under  bombardment,  it  was  wagner 
at  bat;  if  the  Germans  simply  lobbed  over  some  enemy  registration  fire, 
wagner  bunted;  if  we  were  under  light  bombardment,  wagner  doubled,  and 
if  we  were  under  heavy  bombardment,  wagner  (whose  nickname,  it  will  be 
remembered,  was  “Hans”)  knocked  a home  run.  Juvenile  all  this  may  be,  but 
if  codes  are  to  delay  enemy  comprehension,  this  one  no  doubt  served  its 
purpose. 

But  the  finest  codes  in  the  world,  changed  at  the  most  rapid  intervals,  are 
worthless  if  wrongly  used.  Did  the  American  doughboy  fulfill  his  opportunity 
under  these  codes  to  achieve  a superior  security  of  communication?  He  did 
not.  His  irritation  at  the  nuisance  of  encoding  and  his  consequent  unconcern 
for  regulations  could  be  matched  against  any  combatant’s.  Encoding  delayed 
signaling,  and  combat  officers  bitterly  resented  this  gumming  of  communica- 
tions just  when  they  were  most  needed.  Aversion  became  so  extreme  that  at 
one  point  a general  actually  gave  his  division  specific  orders  to  use  no  code 
before  and  during  an  important  movement.  The  order  was  undoubtedly  born 
of  some  unhappy  experiences,  and  it  was,  in  ahy  case,  less  dangerous  than 
any  semicoding  or  other  violations  of  coding  regulations,  such  as  sending 
messages  to  addressees  not  having  the  code,  necessitating  repeats  either  in 
clear  or  another  system.  The  well-known  American  disregard  for  regulations 
— especially  ones  as  persnickety  as  these — and  the  tendency  to  take  the 
easiest  way  out  caused  g.2  a. 6 chief  Moorman  to  remark  exasperatedly  that 
“there  certainly  never  existed  on  the  western  front  a force  more  negligent  in 
the  use  of  their  own  code  than  was  the  American  Army.” 

Violations,  in  fact,  became  so  numerous  that  a Security  Service  was  set  up 
to  monitor  American  radio  messages  (later,  telephone  conversations  as  well). 
Its  first  station  began  operating  at  Toul  on  July  11,  1918;  eventually  the 
A.E.F.  had  four.  The  messages  were  sent  to  an  officer  in  g.2  a. 6 who  studied 
them  for  practices  that  would  help  the  Germans  in  solution.  Letters  pointed 
these  faults  out  to  commanders.  One  sent  by  the  adjutant  general  to  the 
commanding  general  of  the  1st  Army  relating  to  a single  message  of 
September  17,  pointed  out  that  the  plaintext  Boche,  spelled  out  1?y  five  code 
groups,  could  have  been  replaced  by  German  or  enemy,  each  a single  code- 
group, that  two  groups  for  day  light  could  have  been  used  instead  ot  the  18  for 
almost  before  the  crack  of  dawn,  that  work  could  have  been  written  instead  of 
business  with  a saving  of  seven  groups,  and  so  on.  v 

Most  of  these  rather  fussy  letters  were  ignored.  “Only  a few  of  these  were 
answered,”  Moorman  complained,  “and  in  these  cases  the  action  taken  was 
entirely  inadequate.  In  one  case  an  officer  was  reprimanded  by  his  com- 
mander. In  others  the  excuse  was  made  that  officers  did  not  know  or  were  too 


332 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


busy  or  thought  they  were  justified  in  their  action.  ...  in  trying  to  check  up 
and  eliminate  faults  we  have  found  great  willingness  and  ability  to  refer  us  to 
someone  else.”  He  proffered  a unique  solution  of  his  own  to  end  the  vexing 
problem:  “My  idea  would  be  to  hang  a few  of  the  offenders.  This  would  not 
only  get  rid  of  some  but  would  discourage  the  development  of  others.  It 
would  be  a saving  of  lives  to  do  it.”  Barnes’  more  moderate  idea  of  assigning 
a cryptographic  control  officer  to  each  headquarters  was  preferred,  but  it  did 
not  go  into  practice  until  20  years  later. 

Perhaps  the  most  interesting  thing  about  the  entire  American  crypto- 
graphic operation  was  the  attitude  taken  toward  it  by  Barnes  and  his  men. 
They  did  not  regard  their  codes  as  immutable;  rather  they  sought  continually 
to  improve  them.  Further,  their  efforts  encompassed  the  physical  as  well  as 
the  cryptographic  aspects.  Paper,  for  example,  was  chosen  so  that  it  would 
stand  up  just  long  enough  for  the  brief  life  of  the  book  and  would  burn  easily 
in  case  of  danger.  The  typeface — named  “Typewriter” — was  picked  for  its 
legibility  in  the  ill-lit  dugouts  of  the  front.  The  books  continually  shrank  in 
size  from  the  x 9|  inches  of  the  Potomac  to  the  5$  x of  the  Colorado  and 
subsequent  books.  In  the  later  books,  nulls  were  prominently  bunched  next 
to  the  encoding  columns  to  encourage  their  use,  and  common  suffixes,  such 
as  -ing,  were  listed  conveniently  at  the  bottom  of  each  page..  Homophones 
grew  more  abundant,  and  blanks  were  provided  for  special  terms  or  names 
needed  within  the  different  divisions.  A g-2  circular  inviting  suggestions 
brought  in  many  requests  to  include  certain  phrases.  To  use  them  all  would 
have  swollen  the  book  beyond  easily  manageable  proportions,  and  Barnes 
winnowed  out  the  many  local  and  transitory  ones.  But  the  adaptability  of  the 
Code  Compiling  Section  is  shown  by  the  fact  that  almost  half  of  the  1,900 
words  and  phrases  in  the  Osage  Code  were  new  compared  to  those  in  the 
Potomac. 

The  section  never  satisfactorily  resolved  a continuing  dispute  over  the 
relative  merits  of  letters  or  numbers  as  codegroups,  though  it  consulted  many 
telegraphists,  radio  operators,  code  clerks,  and  experienced  code  officers. 
Opinion  was  almost  equally  divided.  Most  of  the  codes  used  three-letter 
codegroups,  but  a few  were  published  with  four-digit  ones  in  an  apparent 
experiment  to  see  which  actually  worked  best.  The  same  undogmatic  approach 
was  demonstrated  in  the  submission  of  the  books  for  cryptanalytic  tests,  and 
in  the  testing  of  50,000  telegraphic  combinations  to  empirically  select  those 
resulting  in  the  fewest  errors  as  codegroups  for  the  Staff  Code. 

In  short,  the  Code  Compiling  Section  was  willing  to  learn,  and  it  did  learn  a 
great  deal  that  notably  improved  American  codes.  To  an  astonishing  degree,  it 
encapsulated  “that  practical,  inventive  turn  of  mind,  quick  to  find  expedients,” 
that  historian  Frederick  Jackson  Turner  found  the  frontier  had  shaped 
as  an  American  trait.  Perhaps  this  is  best  epitomized — with  the  important 
addition  of  some  American  humor — by  the  codegroup  to  report  that  the 
code  had  been  lost.  The  early  codes  did  not  even  have  one.  The  Hudson  Code 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II  333 

displayed  in  large  type  on  its  cover,  “Memorize  this  Group:  ‘2222 — Code 
Lost.’  ” Then  the  codegroup  for  Code  Lost  was  changed  to  dam. 

To  the  right  of  the  imposing  dark  stone  headquarters  building  at  Chaumont 
stood  an  undistinguished,  single-story  barracks  of  glass  and  concrete.  Some- 
times called  the  “Glass  House,”  the  caserne  housed  the  other  half  of  the 
American  cryptologic  effort,  the  Radio  Intelligence  Section,  g.2  a. 6. 

Its  chief,  Moorman,  40,  a native  of  Greenville,  Michigan,  was  a blue-eyed, 
brown-haired  Regular  Army  man  who  had  worked  his  way  up  through  the 
infantry  ranks  from  private.  He  was  a 1915  graduate  of  the  Army  Signal 
School  and  knew  enough  about  cryptanalysis  to  devise  an  ingenious  method 
for  almost  automatically  determining  the  letters  of  a Playfair  keyword. 
Hitt  thought  it  valuable  enough  to  include  in  his  Manual.  In  France,  however, 
Moorman  did  not  engage  in  any  actual  cryptanalysis,  except  perhaps  to  help 
out,  since  his  work  as  head  of  g.2  a. 6 was  administrative,  not  operative.  As  a 
boss  he  was  well  regarded  by  his  men  for  his  fairness  and  blunt  honesty. 

His  organization  began  to  take  rudimentary  shape  in  the  fall  of  1917  with 
a mere  handful  of  men,  the  nucleus  of  what  became  a 72-man  unit  at  the 
period  of  the  A.E.F.’s  maximum  expansion.  They  came  from  the  most  varied 
civilian  occupations.  There  were  two  New  York  lawyers,  both  lieutenants — 
Hugo  A.  Berthold,  who  was  of  Germanic  extraction,  knew  the  language  well, 
and  became  Moorman’s  chief  assistant  and  head  of  code  cryptanalysis,  and 
Robert  Gilmore.  Childs,  who  had  solved  the  superencipherment,  had  been  a 
reporter  on  the  Baltimore  American  before  taking  his  M.A.  at  Harvard  in 
1915.  Lieutenant  Lee  West  Sellers  was  a New  York  music  critic,  and  Lieuten- 
ant John  Graham  an  instructor  at  Washington  and  Lee  University,  later  a 
professor  of  Romance  languages  there.  There  was  an  architect  who  had 
studied  Hebrew,  Persian,  and  other  Oriental  tongues;  one  man  was  a chess 
expert,  another  an  amateur  archaeologist.  About  the  only  two  who  had  had 
any  experience  at  all  with  codes  or  ciphers  were  Corporal  Joseph  P.  Nathan, 
who  had  worked  in  the  code  section  of  the  Grace  Line  in  New  York,  and  one 
not  unknown  to  later  fame,  Lieutenant  William  F.  Friedman,  who  had  be- 
come interested  in  the  subject  several  years  earlier.  In  addition  to  these  men, 
six  cryptanalysts  were  assigned  to  each  army  headquarters  to  decrypt  inter- 
cepts from  their  front  with  keys  from  G.H.Q. 

The  work  of  g.2  a. 6 divided  into  cryptanalysis  and  four  minor  areas — 
traffic  analysis,  intercepting  enemy  telephone  conversations,  following  enemy 
air  artillery  spotters,  and  checking  monitored  American  communications  for 
security  breaches.  These  minor  functions  made  more  important  contributions 
than  it  would  at  first  seem.  Moorman,  for  example,  originally  did  not  con- 
sider the  traffic  analysis  particularly  necessary.  But  he  saw  its  value  when  his 
men  became  skilled  enough  to  draw  a map  of  the  German  order  of  battle  and 
to  see  through  German  fake  messages.  They  even  managed  to  discover  two 
newly  formed  armies  and  thus  help  give  warning  of  a new  German  drive.  The 


334 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


aircraft  teams  eavesdropped  on  the  planes  as  they  signaled  targets  to  their 
batteries  and  warned  Allied  troops  that  they  were  about  to  be  fired  upon; 
sometimes  the  g.2  a. 6 experts  even  identified  the  battery  that  was  about  to 
fire,  permitting  Allied  counterbatteries  to  shell  them  first. 

The  monitoring  officer,  Lieutenant  Woellner,  came  up  with  some  frighten- 
ing object  lessons.  He  deduced  the  entire  American  order  of  battle  for  the 
assault  on  the  Saint-Mihiel  salient  from  monitored  telephone  messages, 
missing  the  time  of  attack  by  24  hours  only  because  one  speaker  had  mis- 
stated it!  Most  of  his  information  came  from  a single  switchboard  operator 
who  complained  that  certain  lines  had  been  broken  by  tanks  and  heavy 
artillery  moving  into  a small  woods  near  him  all  night.  “Whether  or  not  the 
Germans  picked  up  this  message  we  never  learned,”  Moorman  commented 
disgustedly,  “but  it  is  certain  that  this  one  operator  did  all  that  could  be 
reasonably  expected  of  one  man  in  the  matter  of  telling  the  Germans  when 
and  where  the  attack  would  take  place  and  the  forces  to  be  engaged.” 

Like  the  other  sections,  the  cryptanalysts  got  off  to  a slow  start.  Their 
training  had  been  all  in  ciphers,  whereas  the  Germans  were  using  code.  In 
November  of  1917,  Berthold  went  to  the  French  cipher  bureau,  where  he 
picked  up  some  instruction  and  probably  some  current  kru  solutions  as  well. 
With  this  help,  g.2  a. 6 discovered  that  certain  nearby  German  stations  radioed 
regular  reports  at  regular  hours— a habit  that  thenceforth  proved  fatal  to 
many  a Satzbuch.  By  the  end  of  the  first  week  of  a code  s month-long  life, 
Moorman  said,  “we  were  reading  some  of  the  routine  messages.  ...  At  the 
end  of  the  second  week  we  were  reading  many  of  the  messages,  and  at  the 
end  of  the  third  week  we  practically  controlled  the  code.  This  really  meant 
that  we  had  for  one  week  a real  control  of  each  code.  ’ 

g.2  a.6’s  first  real  victory  in  the  war  of  the  intercepts  came  with  the 
introduction  of  the  Schliisselheft.  The  success  was  due  in  large  measure  to  the 
alertness  of  the  Signal  Corps’  Radio  Section,  which  operated  the  network  of 
intercept  stations  that  fed  the  cryptanalysts  their  raw  material.  The  first 
stations  were  set  up  in  the  fall  of  1917,  and  by  the  end  of  the  war  the  five  posts 
had  snatched  72,688  German  messages  from  the  airwaves.  Eight  direction- 
finding stations  took  the  astonishing  total  of  176,913  bearings.  The  radio 
operators,  frequently  working  in  damp  and  drafty  shacks  exposed  to  enemy 
fire,  won  high  praise  from  the  cryptanalysts  for  the  accuracy  of  their  intercep- 
tion of  long  strings  of  meaningless  letters.  Often  they  picked  up  messages  that 
the  other  Allies  had  not  heard,  and  this  was  what  happened  on  March  11, 
1948. 

It  was  at  midnight  of  that  date  that  the  Germans  placed  into  service  not 
merely  a new  code,  but  one  that,  from  its  numerical  codegroups,  appeared  to 
be  of  a different  breed  entirely.  The  Allies  were  expecting  a major  German 
push,  and  the  appearance  of  this  code  was  considered  another  straw  in  the 
wind.  Its  solution  would  obviously  be  of  importance  in  giving  clues  to  German 
activities.  Though  the  British  had  suggested  that  a superencipherment  might 


335 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

be  involved,  the  precise  nature  of  the  system  had  to  be  determined,  the 
superencipherment  stripped  off,  and  the  repertory  then  built  up.  This  would 
have  imposed  much  greater  difficulties  than  just  solving  another  Satzbuch 
edition — except  for  American  alertness. 

Forty  minutes  after  midnight,  the  American  intercept  post  at  Souilly 
picked  up  one  of  the  first  messages  in  the  new  system.  Station  x2  was  sending 
it  to  Station  an: 

00:25  chi- 13  845  422  373  792  240  245  068  652  781  245  659  659  504 

At  12 : 52  an  replied : chi-13  os  rgv  kzd.  Five  minutes  later  x2  sent  a second 
message  to  an  : 

00: 25  chi- 14  uyc  rem  kul  rhi  kwz  rlf  rnq  krd  rvj  uob  kuu  uqx  ufq  rqk 

When  these  appeared  on  the  desk  of  Berthold,  head  of  code  cryptanalysis, 
he  guessed  at  once  what  had  happened:  x2  sends  a 13-group  cipher  message 
(chi- 13)  in  a new  system,  an  responds  with  os,  a well-known  service  abbrevia- 
tion for  Ohne  Sinn  (“message  unintelligible”),  and  a reference  to  chi-13, 
followed  by  two  groups  from  the  old  kru  code.  Whereupon  x2  sends  a second 
message,  this  time  in  kru  but  with  the  original  time  group  (00:25).  The  old 
kru  had  been  partially  solved,  and  Berthold  knew  that  the  rgv  of  the  short 
an  message  meant  “old.”  He  did  not  know  the  meaning  of  kzd,  but  it  seemed 
likely  in  view  of  what  happened  that  it  meant  “Send  in  code,”  making  the 
whole  phrase  “Send  in  old  code.”  Could  the  Germans  have  been  so  stupid  as 
to  compromise  their  new  code  within  an  hour  after  putting  it  into  service  by 
sending  the  same  message  in  both  the  old  and  the  new  systems  ? 

Berthold’s  blue  eyes  fairly  snapped  and  the  few  pale  wisps  of  hair  that  lay 
against  his  bald  pate  almost  stood  up  with  excitement  as  he  decoded  the 
second  x2  message  with  his  reconstructed  kru.  It  read: 

UYC  REM  KUL  RHI  KWZ  RLF  RNQ  KRD  RVJ  UOB  KUU  UQX  UFQ  RQK 

An  [?]  Bn.  2 h i r sch  w i tt  e 

The  kwz  and  uob  appeared  to  be  nulls,  used — almost  certainly  in  violation 
of  regulations — as  word  dividers,  and  rem  probably  meant  Kommandant. 
When  Berthold  checked  this  against  the  second  message,  he  saw  at  once  that 
it  had  the  same  plaintext.  The  repetitions  of  the  plaintext  fs  and  t's,  which 
had  been  masked  by  the  homophones  and  the  lexicon  of  the  kru  code, 
appeared  clearly  in  the  trinumeral  message  as  the  repeated  245s  and  659s. 
With  these  four  points  as  anchors,  Berthold  could  set  up  the  following 
equivalencies: 

845  422  373  792  240  245  068  652  781  245  659  659  504

A staff  airplane  sped  his  result  to  the  British  cryptanalytic  bureau,  and 
Berthold  telegraphed  it  in  a special  codebreakers’  code  to  the  French.  It  was

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


a Rosetta  Stone  for  what  turned  out  to  be  the  new  Schlusselheft.  The  three 
bureaus  cooperated  closely,  but  it  was  largely  due  to  Painvin’s  genius  that 
within  two  days  they  had  neutralized  the  Geheimklappe  superencipherment 
and  dismembered  much  of  the  lexicon.  By  March  21,  when  the  expected 
German  blow  fell,  Allied  cryptanalysts  were  reading  Schlusselheft  messages 
better  than  the  German  code  clerks  themselves.  Theoretically  no  important 
information  was  supposed  to  be  carried  in  it,  because  it  was  intended  only  for 
low-level,  front-line  communications.  But  theory  succumbed  at  times  of  great 
activity,  when  the  information  was  most  desirable,  and  the  trinumeral  mes- 
sages were  laden  with  valuable  nuggets.  “The  sending  of  this  one  message 
must  certainly  have  cost  the  lives  of  thousands  of  Germans,”  Moorman  said, 
“and  conceivably  it  changed  the  result  of  one  of  the  greatest  efforts  made  by 
the  German  armies.” 

As  g.2  a. 6 gained  experience,  it  gained  speed.  Perhaps  the  most  dramatic 
demonstration  came  at  9:05  p.m.  April  28,  when  the  Germans  ordered  an 
attack  for  1 a.m.  The  message  was  intercepted,  telegraphed  to  headquarters, 
cryptanalyzed,  and  employed  to  warn  American  troops  half  an  hour  before 
the  Hun  assault.  Despite  this  rather  sensational  demonstration,  the  higher-ups 
seemed  dissatisfied.  They  felt,  Moorman  protested,  “that  we  were  doing  a lot 
of  unnecessary  work.  What  they  wanted  us  to  do  was  pick  out  the  important 
messages,  decode  them,  and  let  the  rest  go.  They  understood  that  the  greater 
part  of  these  messages  were  valueless  and  so  thought  what  was  the  use  of 
bothering  with  them.  It  was  a matter  of  considerable  difficulty  to  make  them 
see  that  we  had  to  work  them  out  and  that  the  Germans  did  not  tag  their 
important  messages  before  sending  them.” 

During  the  summer  of  1918  g.2  a. 6 received  considerable  help  from  a 
source  that  was  seeking  to  hamper  it.  Code  discipline  had  grown  lax  among 
the  signal  troops  of  the  German  5th  Army,  which  faced  the  American  forces, 
and  one  Lieutenant  Jaeger  was  detailed  to  stiffen  it.  He  knew  what  should  be 
done  and  issued  numerous  orders  to  do  it.  Unfortunately,  he  overlooked  the 
circumstance  that  the  German  codebooks  did  not  include  his  name,  which 
therefore  had  to  be  spelled  out  letter  by  letter  every  time  he  affixed  it  to  an 
order.  This  was  frequently.  Its  peculiar  formation — the  repetition  of  the  high- 
frequency  e,  for  example — permitted  g.2  a.6  to  identify  it  readily,  and  this 
in  turn  led  to  important  clues  concerning  the  superenciphering  Geheimklappe 
and,  in  one  case,  to  the  identification  of  40  groups  in  a new  Schlusselheft. 
Perhaps  it  was  Jaeger  who,  before  his  assignment  to  the  5th  Army,  coined 
one  of  the  unforgettable  slogans  of  communication  security — which  was, 
fittingly  enough,  read  by  G.2  a.6:  Weh  dem  der  leugt  und Klartext funkt  (“Woe 
to  him  who  lies  and  radios  in  clear”).  Jaeger  was  beloved  by  his  adversaries 
because  he  kept  them  up  to  date  with  code  changes,  and  it  was  with  genuine 
regret  that  they  saw  his  name  disappear  from  the  German  traffic. 

The  older,  battle-wise  cryptanalytic  bureaus  of  France  and  England 
developed  increasing  respect  for  their  younger  protege  as  it  gradually  proved 


337 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

itself,  and  the  tendency  was  nurtured  by  the  effective  liaison  work  of  Childs. 
A 25-year-old  Virginian,  he  displayed  enough  diplomatic  ability  to  later 
become  American  ambassador  to  Saudi  Arabia,  Yemen,  and  Ethiopia,  and 
sufficient  command  of  French  to  later  write  a book  in  it  (on  Nicolas  Restif  de 
la  Bretonne,  a bawdy  French  novelist  on  whom,  along  with  Casanova,  Childs 
became  an  international  authority).  On  visits  in  the  spring  and  summer  of 
1918,  Childs  built  up  friendly  relations  with  Hay,  Brooke-Hunt,  Hitchings, 
and  Cartier;  he  enjoyed  a particular  rapport  with  Painvin,  under  whom  he 
studied  for  a week. 

Childs  headed  the  small  group  that  concentrated  on  German  ciphers,  a 
post  he  had  obtained  because  Moorman  mistakenly  thought  he  was  an 
amateur  cryptologist  from  New  York  with  the  same  name.  Moorman  made 
him  liaison  officer  because  of  his  impressive  showing  with  the  American 
trench  code  superencipherment — though  up  to  that  time  Childs,  despite 
diligent  application  of  the  principles  he  had  been  taught,  had  not  solved  a 
single  German  message.  His  ignorance  was  so  abysmal  that  in  London 
Brooke-Hunt  lost  all  interest  in  him  as  soon  as  he  discovered  it.  As  a sop  he 
told  Childs  about  the  German  Fur  god  cipher  and  furnished  him  with  the 
keys.  Childs  soon  discovered  that  the  apparently  incoherent  keys  were 
actually  monoalphabetically  enciphered  versions  of  words  like  instrument- 
enmacher  and  goldarbeiter.  It  became  his  personal  turning  point. 

On  August  5,  an  American  intercept  station  picked  up  a 456-letter  message 
addressed  to  the  German  Foreign  Office  from  General  Kress  von  Kressen- 
stein.  He  had  recently  been  shifted  from  Syria  to  Tiflis  to  prevent  the  rich  oil 
fields  of  the  Caucasus  from  falling  into  Turkish  hands.  This  question  of  friction 
between  allies  acutely  interested  Britain,  for  it  affected  not  only  her  Mesopo- 
tamian campaign  but  also  the  whole  future  of  Persia  and  the  gateways  to  India. 

The  intercept  began : pzave  pnbjy  gjcgb  pzav  pfavg  bpfhg  yzan  rpbbp 
gowib  pcbpr  oobp  xbegh  avbrw  ....  Childs  took  his  frequency  count,  found 
to  his  gratification  that  the  immense  frequency  of  ciphertext  b could  only 
mean  that  it  represented  plaintext  e in  a monoalphabetic  substitution,  and 
within  an  hour  had  broken  the  message.  Von  Kressenstein  was  reporting  the 
unconfirmed  capture  of  Baku,  heart  of  the  oil  basin,  by  Turkey.  The  Turkish 
leader,  Enver  Pasha,  had  assured  him  that  he  was  moving  into  Baku  only  to 
improve  his  sanitary  arrangements,  and  von  Kressenstein  was  reciprocating 
this  obvious  trust.  “To  make  the  Turkish  advance  more  difficult,”  he  stated, 
“I  have  hampered  every  shipment  of  munitions  from  Batum  via  Tiflis  up  to 
the  present  time.”  Childs’  solution  was  important  enough  to  be  included 
verbatim  in  a printed  g-2  survey  of  the  Caucasus  and  Central  Asia.  It  demon- 
strated to  the  Allies  that  the  Turco-German  split  had  gone  deep  enough  for 
one  to  deprive  the  other  of  the  very  essentials  of  combat  in  a struggle  for 
national  existence. 

If  Childs  wondered  in  his  elation  why  so  important  a message  was  being 
clothed  in  so  flimsy  a cipher,  he  discovered  the  answer  a few  days  later  when

he  read  a message  from  Berlin  in  another  and  far  more  secure  system.  “The 
cipher  method  prepared  by  General  von  Kress  was  solved  here  at  once.  Its 
further  use  is  forbidden.” 

Extremely  alert,  Childs  pounced  on  the  freaks  of  German  encipherment 
and  twisted  them  to  American  advantage.  The  Germans,  for  example,  were 
still  using  a double  transposition  that  they  called  the  alachi  as  one  of  their 
systems  of  secret  communication  with  their  forces  in  Russian  Georgia  and 


339

the  Near  East.  On  July  24,  two  alachi  messages  were  intercepted,  one  of  226 
letters  from  Berlin  to  a small  post  at  Tiflis,  the  other  of  152  letters  from  Tiflis 
to  Constantinople.  The  Berlin  message  resisted  all  attempts  at  solution,  but 
Childs  discovered  that  the  encipherer  at  Tiflis  had  omitted  the  second  trans- 
position. He  solved  it  as  a simple  columnar  with  a 22-number  key.  When  he 
applied  this  key  twice  to  the  other  message,  he  read  it  with  ease.  It  proved  to 
be  a message  signed  by  General  Erich  Ludendorff,  the  German  chief  of 
staff-. 

In  another  case,  Childs  noticed  that  the  second  part  of  a message  from 
Berlin  to  Constantinople  on  November  1 was  repeated  the  next  day  with  the 
addition  of  only  two  letters.  Using  the  slight  difference  as  a fulcrum,  Childs 
levered  back  and  forth  from  one  message  to  another  like  a bridge  player 
working  a ruff  and  within  an  hour  and  a half  on  the  afternoon  of  November  2 
had  solved  them  both.  At  this  time  and  on  this  front,  German  keys  remained 
in  effect  for  three  days,  and  when  he  used  them  to  read  a long  message  of 
November  3 in  13  parts,  he  detonated  a small  bomb  of  excitement  at 
G.H.Q. 

“By  reason  of  its  length,”  Childs  wrote  later,  “I  was  persuaded  before  the 
message  had  even  been  reduced  to  German  plaintext,  a long  and  tedious  task, 
that  it  was  likely  to  contain  information  of  more  than  ordinary  interest.  . . . 
Every  available  German  translator  of  the  Section  was  pressed  into  service, 
while  I superintended  the  conversion  of  the  ciphertext  to  German,  of  which 
language  I was  almost  entirely  ignorant  save  for  that  instinctive  feel  for  the 
mechanics  of  it  which  any  cryptographer  acquires  from  such  intimate  daily 
contact  with  it  as  I had  had.” 

It  turned  out  to  be  a highly  revealing  review  of  the  situation  in  the  Balkans 
as  seen  by  the  German  commander  there,  Field  Marshal  August  von  Macken- 
sen.  The  dynamite  was  in  the  twelfth  part,  where  Mackensen  proposed  “that 
the  army  of  occupation  be  withdrawn  from  Rumania  at  once.”  The  con- 
queror’s jackboots  there  were  enforcing  a particularly  harsh  peace  treaty,  and 
it  was  not  beyond  conjecture  that  the  Rumanians  would  rise  in  fury  as  soon 
as  the  military  restraint  was  removed  and  fall  upon  the  Germans  from 
behind.  This  possibility  suddenly  brightened  for  the  Allies  with  the  informa- 
tion extracted  from  the  Mackensen  telegram.  Accordingly,  as  soon  as  it  was 
deciphered  and  translated,  Berthold  grasped  Childs  by  the  sleeve  and  rushed 
with  him  and  the  telegram  to  the  office  of  the  assistant  chief  of  staff.  When  the 
colonel  there  read  it,  he  caught  Berthold’s  excitement,  and  he  dashed  out  of 
the  office  carrying  the  telegram.  He  returned  to  say  that  its  contents  had  been 
communicated  to  the  Supreme  War  Council.  A few  days  later,  when  Macken- 
sen evacuated  Bucharest  to  the  hooting  of  the  crowd,  the  Rumanian  govern- 
ment denounced  the  peace  treaty  and  declared  war  anew  upon  Germany. 

The  Mackensen  message  was  in  the  adfgvx  system — probably  the  most 
famous  field  cipher  in  all  cryptology.  It  was  so  named  because  only  those  six 


340  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

letters  appeared  in  the  cryptograms,*  though  just  five  were  used  (no  v)  when 
the  system  sprang  into  use  on  March  5,  1918. 

The  war  in  the  West  had  by  then  become  a stalemate  of  exhaustion.  The 
young  recruits  who  the  Kaiser  had  promised  in  the  glorious  summer  of 
1914  would  be  “home  before  the  leaves  fall”  had  become  veterans  hardened 
by  almost  four  years  of  battle — those  few  who  survived.  The  flower  of 
England’s  youth  had  perished;  in  France,  a generation  had  climbed  out  of 
the  trenches  and  vanished  forever. 

During  the  winter,  Germany  had  come  to  realize  that  she  would  have  to 
win  in  the  spring  if  she  were  to  win  at  all.  The  U-boat  had  failed  to  starve 
England  into  submission,  and  the  United  States  had  entered  the  war  against 
her.  But  the  collapse  of  Russia  had  freed  dozens  of  German  divisions  for 
service  on  the  Western  Front  and,  for  the  first  time,  Germany  held  a numerical 
preponderance  there.  This,  however,  was  only  until  America  could  transport 
her  strong  young  forces  across  the  Atlantic.  It  was  to  be  now  or  never,  and 
the  imperial  government  lashed  its  weary  troops  and  hungry  civilians  for  the 
supreme  effort  that  was  to  bring  final  victory. 

It  was  no  less  clear  to  the  Allies  that  Germany  planned  to  launch  a 
climactic  offensive  in  the  spring.  There  were  many  signs — the  new  cipher  itself 
was  one.  The  question  was:  Where  and  when  would  the  actual  blow  fall? 
The  German  high  command,  recognizing  the  incalculable  military  value  of 
surprise,  shrouded  its  plans  in  the  tightest  secrecy.  Artillery  was  brought  up 
in  concealment;  feints  were  flung  out  here  and  there  along  the  entire  front 
to  keep  the  Allies  off  balance;  the  adfgvx  cipher,  which  had  reportedly 
been  chosen  from  among  many  candidates  by  a conference  of  German 
cipher  specialists,  constituted  an  element  in  this  overall  security,  as 
did  the  new  Schliisselheft.  The  Allies  bent  every  effort  and  tapped  every 
source  of  information  to  find  out  the  time  and  place  of  the  real  assault.  But 
one  of  their  most  flowing  founts — cryptanalysis — appeared  to  have  dried 
up. 

When  the  first  adfgx  messages  were  brought  to  Painvin,  the  best  crypt- 
analyst in  the  Bureau  du  Chiffre,  he  stared  at  them,  ran  a hand  through  his 
thick  black  hair  with  an  air  of  perplexity,  and  then  set  to  work.  The  presence 
of  only  five  letters  immediately  suggested  a checkerboard.  Without  much 
hope,  he  tried  the  messages  as  simple  monalphabetics;  the  tests  were,  as 
he  had  expected,  negative.  He  discarded  a polyalphabetic  checkerboard  as 
too  cumbersome,  and  was  left  with  the  hypothesis  that  the  checkerboard 
substitution  had  been  subjected  to  a transposition.  On  this  basis  he  began 
to  work. 

Nothing  happened.  The  traffic  was  too  light  for  him  even  to  determine  by 
frequency  counts  whether  the  checkerboard  key  changed  each  day,  and  with-

A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

out  this  basic  information  he  did  not  dare  to  amalgamate  the  cryptograms  of 
successive  days  for  a concerted  assault.  Cartier  looked  on  over  his  shoulder  as 
he  braided  and  unbraided  the  letters  and  mused  sadly,  “Poor  Painvin.  This 
time  I don’t  think  you’ll  get  it.”  Painvin,  goaded,  worked  harder  than  before. 
Meanwhile,  Berthold  achieved  his  Schliisselheft  entry  and  Painvin,  shifting 
temporarily  to  that  more  fruitful  field,  completed  it.  But  the  enciphered  code, 
used  only  for  trench  communications,  provided  no  strategic  insights.  These 
would  come,  if  they  were  to  come  at  all,  through  solution  of  the  adfgx, 
which  direction-finding  showed  was  carrying  messages  between  the  higher 
German  headquarters,  chiefly  those  of  divisions  and  army  corps.  Painvin 
strained  even  harder. 

At  4:30  a.m.  March  21,  6,000  guns  suddenly  fired  upon  the  Allied  line  at 
the  Somme  in  the  most  furious  artillery  cannonade  of  the  war.  Five  hours 
later,  62  German  divisions  rolled  forward  on  a 40-mile  front.  The  surprise 
was  complete  and  its  success  overwhelming.  French  and  British  troops  reeled 
back  day  after  day  in  stunned  confusion.  The  head  of  intelligence  at  French 
G.H.Q.  came  into  the  cryptologic  bureau  three  days  later  and  told  Major 
E.-A.  Soudart,  the  replacement  for  Givierge,  who  had  gone  to  the  front,  and 
his  assistant  Marcel  Guitard:  “By  virtue  of  my  job  I am  the  best  informed 
man  in  France,  and  at  this  moment  I no  longer  know  where  the  Germans  are. 
If  we’re  captured  in  an  hour,  it  wouldn’t  surprise  me.”  Within  a week  the 
Germans  had  punched  a hole  38  miles  deep  in  the  Allied  lines,  and  it  was  not 
until  the  British  and  French  troops  fell  back  to  Amiens  that  they  collected 
themselves  and  halted  the  advance. 

The  furious  advance  was  reflected  in  a dramatic  upsurge  in  radio  traffic. 
The  first  result  was  disappointment.  Painvin’s  frequency  counts  showed  that 
the  checkerboard  key  did  change  daily;  presumably  the  transposition  key  did 
also.  Solution  would  therefore  require  a goodly  quantity  of  text  from  a single 
day,  but  until  April  1 the  interceptions  were  too  meager.  On  that  day,  the 
French  picked  up  18  adfgx  messages  totaling  512  five-letter  groups.  Two  of 
them  had  been  sent  in  three  parts,  none  of  the  same  length:  the  Germans  had 
had  their  fingers  burned  by  multiple  anagramming  early  in  the  war  and  had 
learned  their  lesson. 

Studying  them,  Painvin  noticed  on  April  4 that  the  first  parts  of  the  two 
messages  had  identical  bits  and  pieces  of  text  larded  in  the  same  order  in  the 
cryptograms.  This  oddity  could  most  likely  have  resulted  from  both  crypto- 
grams having  identical  beginnings  transposed  according  to  the  same  key;  the 
identical  fragments  of  text  would  then  represent  the  identical  tops  of  the 
columns  of  the  transposition  tableau.  Sectioning  the  cryptograms  so  that  each 
identical  fragment  started  a new  segment  would  yield  the  columns  of  the 
tableau,  in  the  order  of  their  transcription.  Painvin  did  this  to  chi-110,  the 
1 10-letter  first  part  of  a message  from  vi  to  b8,  and  to  chi- 104,  the  104-letter 
first  part  of  a message  sent  13  minutes  later,  also  from  vi  but  this  time  to  bf:

The  problem  now  was  to  discover  the  transposition  key,  or,  to  put  it 
another  way,  to  reconstitute  the  block.  A beginning  could  be  made  on  the 
principle  that  the  long  columns  stood  at  the  left.  Painvin  saw  that  in  both 
cryptograms  columns  3,  6,  14,  and  18 — meaning  the  columns  headed  by  these 
keynumbers— were  longer  than  the  other  columns.  He  moved  them  to  the 
extreme  left  of  the  block.  Columns  4,  7,  9,  11,  16,  and  19  were  short  in  chi- 
104  and  long  in  chi-1  10;  consequently  they  clustered  in  a zone  to  the  right  of 
the  first  four  but  to  the  left  of  the  remaining  ten  columns.  The  remaining  ten 
were  short  in  both  messages  and  thus  pushed  to  the  right.  These  three  zones 
marked  a first  approximation  to  the  key. 

Unable  to  wrest  any  more  information  from  the  first  parts  of  the  messages, 
Painvin  turned  to  their  third  parts  in  the  hope  of  finding  a common  ending. 
Common  repetitions  showed  him  that  they  had  indeed  a common  ending,  and 
this  enabled  him  to  properly  segmentize  them  into  columns  as  he  had  the  first 
parts.  He  partially  divided  up  each  of  the  three  zones  within  themselves  on  the 
same  basis  of  long  and  short  columns.  He  thus  made  a second  approximation 
to  the  transposition  key.  This  showed  conclusively  that  columns  5 and  8 
huddled  next  to  one  another  in  the  middle  of  the  tableau  and  that  12  and  20 
stood  at  the  extreme  right — though  in  neither  case  did  Painvin  yet  know 
whether  their  order  was  5-8  or  8-5,  or  12-20  or  20-12. 

He  went  back  to  the  original  18  intercepts  of  the  day,  sliced  them  into  20 
segments,  and  matched  segment  5 to  segment  8 in  all  of  them.  Sixty  letter- 
pairs  resulted  from  this  juxtaposition,  and  Painvin  took  a frequency  count  of 
them — so  many  aa’s,  so  many  ad’s,  so  many  af’s,  and  so  on.  To  his  delight 
the  count  showed  all  the  characteristics  of  a mon  alphabetic  substitution. 
This  indicated  that  the  two  columns  indeed  belonged  together  in  the  trans- 
position block,  for  placing  two  wrong  segments  side  by  side  would  have 
resulted  in  a flatfish  count.  It  verified  his  original  system  assumptions  as  well 
as  his  transposition  rough-out. 

He  made  a similar  test  with  the  12-20  combination,  and  found  an  equally 
monoalphabetic  count.  The  most  frequent  pair  was  dg,  with  a frequency  of  8, 
probably  representing  plaintext  e.  But  dg  in  the  5-8  coupling  had  a frequency 
of  zero — impossible  for  German  e.  On  the  other  hand,  gd  had  a frequency  of 
8.  Since  Painvin  did  not  know  the  order  of  the  columns  within  each  pairing, 
his  arbitrary  5-8  order  for  the  frequency  count  had  probably  reversed  the 
letter-pairs  respective  to  12-20.  To  correlate  them,  Painvin  reversed  5-8  into 


343 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

8-5,  turning  its  gd  into  dg,  which,  with  its  frequency  of  8,  was  a much  better 
candidate  for  e.  The  former  dg  became  gd,  frequency  zero.  Painvin  could 
now  set  up  a skeleton  checkerboard — which  he  did  on  the  basis  that  the  co- 
ordinates would  be  taken  in  the  order  side-top — and  could  insert  his  plaintext 
values  in  it  as  he  recovered  them: 


A D F G X 


A 

D 

> c 

F 

G 

X 

How  could  the  rest  of  the  transposition  block  be  reconstructed?  Since  the 
coordinates  were  taken  repeatedly  in  the  order  side-top,  side-top,  side-top, 
and  since  the  block  had  20  columns,  all  the  side  coordinates  would  have  fallen 
into  the  1st,  3rd,  5th,  . . . 19th  positions  during  encipherment,  and  all  the  top 
coordinates  into  the  even  positions,  thus : 

position  number  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20 

position  odd  or  even  oeoeoeoeoe  oe  oe  oe  oe  oe 
column  key  number  8 5 12  20 


side  or  top  coO 
ordinates  / 


STSTSTSTS  T S TS  TS  TS  TS  T 

STSTSTSTS  T S TS  TS  TS  TS  T 


If,  Painvin  thought,  the  side  coordinates  could  be  separated  from  the  top 
ones,  this  would  separate  the  odd  positions  from  the  evens.  The  coordinate 
separation  might  be  effected  on  the  basis  of  frequency  characteristics.  The 
frequency  of  the  side  coordinate  d should  differ  from  that  of  the  top  co- 
ordinate d because  the  total  frequency  of  the  five  letters  in  the  d row  should 
differ  from  the  total  frequency  of  the  five  letters  in  the  d column.  The  same 
should  hold  true  for  the  other  coordinates.  Hence  the  top  coordinates  should 
manifest  a different  frequency  profile  than  the  side  coordinates. 

Painvin’s  frequency  counts  showed  that  the  columns  of  the  cryptograms 
indeed  separated  into  two  groups:  one  with  d as  its  maximum  and  G as  its 
minimum,  the  other  group  with  G as  its  maximum  and  f as  its  minimum.  The 
first  group,  which  included  column  12,  turned  out  to  stand  in  the  odd  posi- 
tions. Painvin  then  determined  which  odd  went  with  which  even  by  matching 
one  with  another;  only  correct  pairings  showed  mon  alphabetic  distributions. 
Simultaneously  he  began  solving  for  actual  plaintext  and  building  up  his 
checkerboard,  and,  after  48  hours  of  incredible  labor,  Painvin  had  cracked  the 
first  messages  in  the  toughest  field  cipher  the  world  had  yet  seen. 

His  feat  shows  the  cryptanalytic  mind  at  its  finest.  Painvin  spotted  oppor- 
tunities that  many  would  have  missed,  and  when  he  worked  with  one,  he  did 
not  leave  it  until  he  had  wrung  it  dry.  This  technique  of  extracting  every  drop 
of  information  from  each  phase  of  solution  before  moving  on  served  well,  for 


344 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  cipher  prickles  with  many  defenses.  Most  stem  from  its  fractionating 
nature — the  breaking-up  of  a plaintext  letter’s  equivalent  into  pieces,  with  the 
consequent  dissipation  of  its  ordinary  characteristics.  The  transposition  then 
scatters  these  characteristics  in  a particularly  effective  fashion,  while  the 
dissipation,  in  turn,  dulls  the  clues  that  normally  help  reconstruct  the 
transposition. 

It  is  not  surprising,  therefore,  that  the  Allies  never  developed  a general 
solution  for  the  adfgvx.  Cryptanalysis  nearly  always  depended  on  the  finding 
of  two  messages  with  identical  beginnings  or  endings  or  some  other  quirk. 
This  explains  the  apparent  anomaly  that  although  only  ten  keys  covering  as 
many  days  were  ever  recovered  on  the  Western  Front,  approximately  half  the 
adfgvx  messages  ever  sent  were  solved : solutions  were  achieved  only  on  the 
days  of  heaviest  traffic.  From  the  German  point  of  view,  the  system  was  quick 
and  easy,  involving  only  two  simple  steps.  Messages  were  doubled  in  length, 
but  this  disadvantage  was  somewhat  offset  by  the  presence  of  only  six 
different  letters  in  the  cryptograms,  making  transmission  faster  and  more 
accurate. 

By  the  time  Painvin  had  achieved  his  first  solution,  the  first  German 
offensive  had  spent  its  force,  and  the  volume  of  traffic  had  diminished.  He 
rummaged  through  the  piles  of  intercepts  to  find  others  with  common  endings 
or  beginnings  and  began  working  on  the  messages  of  March  29,  which  were 
relatively  abundant.  On  April  26,  after  three  weeks  of  work,  he  finally  broke 
through.  Meanwhile  the  Germans  again  struck  with  surprise  and  forced  the 
English  back  almost  to  the  sea.  But  Painvin  was  now  getting  his  feet  on  the 
ground,  and  the  subsequent  key  recoveries  came  with  increasing  speed.  It 
took  only  nine  and  a half  days  to  discover  the  key  for  the  April  5 messages. 
On  the  morning  of  May  29,  he  started  to  work  on  the  messages  of  the  day 
before,  and  two  days  later  had  their  key.  He  took  up  the  messages  of  the 
30th  at  4 p.m.  on  May  31  and  was  reading  them  at  5 p.m.  the  next  day. 

By  then  the  French  had  been  dealt  two  unpleasant  blows — one  military, 
one  cryptographic.  Ludendorff  had  again  managed  to  conceal  the  time  and 
place  of  a major  assault.  Fifteen  of  his  divisions  fell  by  surprise  on  seven.  A 
gray  flood  of  Germans  inundated  the  French  positions  in  the  heights  of  the 
Chemin-des-Dames  and  surged  forward  irresistibly  until  it  lapped  the  banks  of 
the  Marne  only  30  miles  from  Paris,  almost  submerging  the  Allied  cause.  At 
the  same  time,  Painvin  suddenly  saw,  on  June  1,  the  adfgx  message  com- 
plicated by  the  addition  of  a sixth  letter,^  Probably  the  Germans  expanded 
their  checkerboard  to  6x6.  But  why?  For  homophones  to  further  blunt  the 
frequency  clues?  Or  to  insert  the  ten  digits?  Painvin  did  not  know. 

“In  short,”  he  said,  “I  had  a moment  of  discouragement.  The  last  two  keys 
of  the  28th  and  the  30th  of  May  had  been  discovered  under  conditions  of  such 
rapidity  that  their  exploitation  was  of  the  greatest  usefulness.  The  offensive 
and  the  German  advance  still  continued.  It  was  of  the  greatest  importance  not 
to  lose  [cryptanalytic]  contact  and  in  my  heart  I did  not  want  to  brusquely 


A War  of  Intercepts:  II  345 

shut  off  this  source  of  information  to  the  interested  services  of  the  armies, 
which  had  become  accustomed  to  counting  on  its  latest  results.” 

He  opened  his  assault  on  the  cryptograms  of  June  1 at  5 p.m.  Three 
messages  of  that  date  all  bore  the  same  time  group  (00:05)  and  had  all  been 
sent  from  a transmitter  with  call-sign  gci.  Painvin  compared  two  of  them,  one 
to  call-sign  dax,  the  other  to  dak,  that  had  almost  identical  texts  of  106  letters 
each.  But  aside  from  indicating  a keylength  of  21,  they  led  nowhere:  they 
were  too  similar.  He  then  compared  the  dax  cryptogram  with  the  third  from 
gci,  a message  of  108  letters  to  dtd  that  closely  resembled  the  others.  These 
he  cut  into  column  segments  as  he  had  done  with  the  messages  of  April  1.  He 
obtained  two  roughed-out  transposition  blocks,  whose  key-order  he  still  did 
not  know. 

Painvin  assumed,  however,  that  the  two  plaintexts  were  the  same  except 
for  the  addition  of  a single  element  to  the  internal  address  of  the  dtd  message. 
This  would  have  pushed  the  identical  portion  two  notches  further  back  in  the 
dtd  block  than  in  the  dax  one.  He  had  only  to  seek  an  arrangement  of 
columns  that  would  produce  such  a result.  Within  an  hour  he  had  found  it: 

6 16  7 5 17  2 14  10  15  9 13  1 21  12  4 8 19  3 11  20  18  '

The  dax  plaintext  read:  14  ID  XX  Gen  Kdo  ersucht  vordere  Linie  sofort 
drahten  XX  Gen  Kdo  7 (“14th  Infantry  Division:  HQ  requests  front  line 
[situation]  by  telegraph.  HQ  7th  [Corps]”).  The  dtd  text  was  identical  except 
for  its  being  addressed  216  ID. 

Painvin  completed  his  solution  at  7 p.m.  on  June  2,  and  sent  it  at  once  to 
G.H  .Q.  By  then  the  French  had  managed  to  halt  Ludendorff’s  push,  but  they 
teetered  precariously  on  the  brink  of  defeat.  The  Germans  were  shelling 
Paris  from  60  miles  away  with  their  long-range  guns.  The  great  German 
successes  of  March  and  May  had  driven  two  vast  salients  into  Allied  territory. 
They  pointed  like  daggers  at  Paris.  And  the  great  question  recurred:  Where 
would  Ludendorff  strike  next?  The  thin  Allied  lines  could  not  hold  against  a 
massive  piledriver  blow  concentrated  on  a single  point.  If  Ludendorff  could 
gain  the  same  surprise  that  he  had  so  successfully  achieved  in  each  previous 
assault,  he  could  puncture  the  Allied  defenses,  overrun  Paris,  and  perhaps 
end  the  war.  The  Allies’  only  hope  of  stopping  him  was  to  absorb  his  thrust 


346  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

head-on  with  their  reserves.  But  to  do  this  they  had  to  know  where  to  send 
them. 

The  French  discussed  the  possibilities.  Would  Ludendorff  lunge  out 
directly  for  Paris  from  the  tip  of  one  of  his  salients  despite  the  danger  to  their 
flanks  ? Or  would  he  first  flatten  out  the  large  dent  between  those  bulges  and 
then  drive  forward  from  a consolidated  position?  If  the  latter,  where  in  the 
huge  pocket  would  he  strike?  No  one  knew. 

Ludendorff,  meanwhile,  was  having  troubles  of  his  own.  German  military 
doctrine  called  for  a sudden,  intense  artillery  bombardment  to  paralyze  the 
defenders  before  the  infantry  attacked.  This  saturation  technique  required 
concentrating  thousands  of  field  pieces  and  tons  of  munitions  at  the  battle- 
front.  At  a conference  early  in  June,  Ludendorff  learned  that  this  concentra- 
tion was  running  behind  the  schedule  he  had  set  for  his  next  assault.  His 
successes  had  strained  his  lines  of  transport,  and  he  had  been  moving  his 
guns  and  shells  only  under  cover  of  night  to  preserve  the  invaluable  advantage 
of  surprise. 

And  this  advantage  he  had  conserved  superbly.  The  hints  that  drifted  out 
to  French  G.H.Q.  about  his  intentions  were  multiple,  petty,  and  contradic- 
tory. Nothing  would  jell.  Gloomy  intelligence  officers  could  reach  no  definite 
conclusions.  Another  attack  was  certainly  in  the  offing,  but  unless  they  could 
ascertain  its  location,  France  might  be  lost. 

Into  this  dismal  atmosphere  on  the  morning  of  June  3 burst  Guitard  of 
the  Service  du  Chiffre,  excitedly  waving  an  intercept.  One  of  the  G.H.Q. 
cryptanalysts,  applying  the  keys  that  Painvin  had  sent  there,  had  just 
read  a cryptogram  sent  at  4:30  a.m.,  only  a few  hours  earlier:

Direction-finders  reported  that  it  had  been  transmitted  by  the  German  High 
Command.  The  addressee,  dic,  was  known  from  traffic  analysis  and  direction- 
finding to  be  the  18th  Army’s  general  staff  in  Remaugies — a town  situated 
just  above  the  concavity  in  the  German  lines.  Its  plaintext  read:  Munition- 
ierung  beschleunigen  Punkt  Soweit  nicut  [error  for  nicht]  eingesehen  auch  bei 
Tag  (“Rush  munitions  Stop  Even  by  day  if  not  seen”). 

Guitard  and  the  intelligence  officers  recognized  at  once  that  the  ammuni- 
tion mentioned  in  the  telegram  was  that  intended  for  the  usual  German  pre- 
assault bombardment,  and  the  location  of  the  addressee  of  the  message  told 
them  where  that  attack  would  come.  Jubilantly  they  communicated  their 
information  to  the  operations  officers:  Ludendorff  was  going  to  hammer  out 
the  dent,  and  the  German  sledge  would  crash  down  onto  the  French  line 
between  Montdidier  and  Compiegne,  a sector  about  50  miles  north  of 
Paris. 

Aerial  reconnaissance  confirmed  the  daylight  transport  of  munitions.

A War  of  Intercepts:  II 

Deserters  reported  that  the  onslaught  would  take  place  June  7.  Foch,  in 
supreme  command,  shifted  his  reserves  into  position,  thinned  out  the  front 
lines,  upon  which  the  brunt  of  the  cannonade  would  fall,  and  braced  his 
secondary  defenses.  On  the  6th,  officers  were  told  that  “the  offensive  is 
imminent.”  Tension  mounted.  The  7th  passed  without  enemy  action,  and  the 
8th:  Ludendorff  had  postponed  the  attack  for  two  days  to  bring  up  more  guns 
and  munitions  because,  he  said,  “thorough  preparation  was  essential  to 
success.”  The  French  waited  tensely  but  with  confidence.  At  midnight  on 
June  9 the  front  from  Montdidier  to  Compiegne  erupted  in  a fierce,  pelting 
hurricane  of  high-explosive,  shrapnel,  and  gas  shells.  For  three  hours  a 
German  artillery  concentration  that  averaged  one  gun  for  no  more  than  ten 
yards  of  front  poured  a continual  stream  of  fire  onto  the  French  positions— 
and  Ludendorff ’s  urgent  demand  for  ammunition  became  clear.  But  this  time, 
for  the  first  time  since  Ludendorff  began  his  stupendous  series  of  triumphs, 
there  was  no  surprise.  Painvin’s  manna  had  saved  the  French. 

A little  before  dawn  15  German  divisions  charged  forward.  The  French 
were  ready.  For  five  days,  fighting  seesawed  back  and  forth.  Initially  the 
Germans  took  the  little  villages  of  Mery  and  Courcelles,  but  on  June  11, 
General  Charles  Mangin  counterattacked  with  five  divisions  and  all  the  elan 
the  French  could  muster.  He  stopped  the  German  advance  cold  and  then 
swept  the  gray  tide  out  of  the  two  villages.  Again  the  Germans  heaved 
forward  in  a great  effort.  They  failed  with  heavy  losses.  For  the  first  time  that 
spring,  Ludendorff  suspended  an  operation  before  it  had  achieved  its  goal. 
Mangin,  wearing  his  gold-brocaded  kepi,  laughed  beneath  the  guns  of  victory. 
Foch,  who  realized  that  other  German  assaults  would  come  and  that  he 
would  have  to  defend  against  them,  knew  at  last  that  he  would  some  day  take 
the  offensive.  He  knew  then  that  the  war  was  not  lost,  and  could  eventually 
be  won.  Within  a few  weeks,  the  final  German  thrusts  did  come,  but  they  had 
run  out  of  steam,  and  the  French  parried  them.  Soon  the  initiative  passed  to 
the  Allies,  bolstered  by  the  Americans,  and  their  powerful  counterstrokes 
drove  the  German  armies  back  and  back  until  the  Kaiser,  his  militaristic 
dreams  wrecked,  abdicated  and  fled  while  his  generals  signed  the  Armistice  at 
Compiegne.  The  World  War  was  ended. 

For  Painvin,  who  had  lost  33  pounds  while  simply  seated  at  his  desk,  there 
was  a long  leave  of  convalescence.  Afterwards,  he  engaged  in  an  immensely 
successful  business  career,  becoming  president  and  director  general  of  Ugine, 
the  chemical  giant  of  France,  president  of  a phosphate  company,  vice  presi- 
dent of  a commercial  credit  firm,  administrator  of  a mortgage  society, 
honorary  president  of  the  Union  of  Chemical  Industries  and  of  the  central 
committee  of  the  electrochemical  trade,  and  president  of  the  Chamber  of 
Commerce  of  Paris.  Yet,  he  said,  none  of  these  achievements  ever  gave  him 
the  satisfaction  that  his  adfgvx  solutions  did.  They  left  “an  indelible  mark  on 
my  spirit,  and  remain  for  me  one  of  the  brightest  and  most  outstanding 
memories  of  my  existence.”

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

The  First  World  War  marks  the  great  turning  point  in  the  history  of 
cryptology.  Before,  it  was  a small  field;  afterwards,  it  was  big.  Before,  it  was  a 
science  in  its  youth;  afterwards,  it  had  matured.  The  direct  cause  of  this 
development  was  the  enormous  increase  in  radio  communications. 

This  heavy  traffic  meant  that  probably  the  richest  source  of  intelligence 
flowed  in  these  easily  accessible  channels.  All  that  was  necessary  was  to  crack 
the  protective  sheath.  As  cryptanalysis  repeatedly  demonstrated  its  abilities 
and  worth,  it  rose  from  an  auxiliary  to  a primary  source  of  information  about 
the  foe;  its  advocates  spoke  regularly  in  the  councils  of  war.  Its  new  status 
was  exemplified  in  terms  clear  to  every  military  mind  when  both  Cartier  and 
Givierge  became  generals.  The  emergence  of  cryptanalysis  as  a permanent 
major  element  of  intelligence  was  the  most  striking  characteristic  of  crypto- 
logy’s new  maturity. 

Another  was  the  change  in  cryptanalysis  itself.  The  science  at  last  outgrew 
the  mode  of  operation  that  had  dominated  it  for  400  years.  This  was  chamber 
analysis,  in  which  a single  man  wrestles  with  a single  cryptogram  alone  in  his 
room;  John  Wallis  epitomizes  the  genre.  Chamber  analysis  began  to  fail  the 
cryptanalysts  in  the  first  days  of  the  war.  The  German  double  transposition 
required  at  least  two  messages  of  the  same  length  for  solution,  but  a great 
many  messages  had  to  be  intercepted  before  the  law  of  averages  would  hatch 
those  two.  As  cipher  systems  grew  increasingly  complex,  cryptanalysis  relied 
more  and  more  on  special  solutions  like  this,  and  so  they  required  many  more 
messages  for  success  than  the  bewigged  practitioners  of  chamber  analysis 
would  have  ever  thought  necessary.  They  also  depended  more  heavily  on  such 
auxiliary  aids  as  traffic  analysis  and  knowledge  of  surrounding  events,  be- 
cause the  more  that  is  known  about  the  circumstances  in  which  messages  are 
sent,  the  easier  solutions  by  special  case  become.  Cryptanalysts  thus  became 
much  more  intimately  connected  with  the  real  world. 

A third  characteristic  of  the  new  maturity  was  the  evolution  of  fields  of 
cryptanalytic  specialization.  Systems  of  secret  communication  had  ceased  to 
be  so  few  and  so  homogeneous  that  a single  expert  could  subdue  them  all. 
Their  multiplicity  and  heterogeneity,  plus  the  volume  of  traffic  in  each,  bred 
the  specialist.  Such,  for  example,  was  Childs,  who  worked  exclusively  on 
ciphers,  while  others  in  g.2  a. 6 attacked  codes.  Perhaps  the  most  interesting 
specialist  of  all  was  the  chief  of  the  cryptanalytic  office  himself.  No  longer 
could  he  seclude  himself  in  a quiet  little  world  of  letters  and  numbers  as  just 
the  foremost  among  a group  of  cryptanalysts,  like  the  English  Decypherers. 
The  more  active  cryptology  of  the  20th  century  impinged  on  so  many  more 
areas  that  the  chief  had  to  devote  his  energies  exclusively  to  learning  from 
other  branches  of  the  services  what  intelligence  was  most  needed,  disposing 
his  team  of  codebreakers  to  get  it,  and  obtaining  information  in  the  form  of 
battle  reports,  cleartext  intercepts,  prisoner-of-war  interrogations,  captured 
documents,  and  the  like  that  would  help  them  in  their  special  solutions.  The 
chief  had  become  purely  an  executive,  who  himself  never  picked  up  a colored

pencil  or  an  eraser  for  an  actual  solution,  though  he  necessarily  needed  a 
thorough  knowledge  of  the  technique.  His  new  responsibilities,  of  course, 
stemmed  in  large  measure  from  cryptology’s  upgraded  position.  But  they  also 
reflected  the  specialization  now  required  in  the  burgeoning  field,  and  this 
division  of  labor  is  as  much  a sign  of  maturity  in  cryptology  as  it  is  in  a society. 

Still  another  sign  of  that  maturity  was  the  emotional  apprehension  of  the 
role  played  by  the  blunders  of  inexperienced,  indolent,  and  ignorant  crypto- 
graphic clerks.  Cryptologists  had  had  an  intellectual  awareness  of  this  danger 
at  least  since  1605,  when  Francis  Bacon  wrote  that  “in  regards  of  the  rawness 
and  unskillfulnesse  of  the  handes,  through  which  they  passe,  the  greatest 
Matters,  are  many  times  carryed  in  the  weakest  Cyphars.”  But  it  was  not 
until  cipher  key  after  cipher  key,  and  code  after  code,  had  been  betrayed  by 
needless  mistakes  or  stupidities  or  outright  rule  violations  that  the  magnitude 
of  the  problem  was  borne  in  upon  them.  The  problem  had  swollen  to  such 
proportions  because  so  large  a volume  of  messages  had  to  be  handled  by  so 
many  untrained  men — against  whom  were  pitted  the  best  brains  of  the  enemy. 
The  experts  realized  that  to  eliminate  these  is  to  strengthen  cryptographic 
security  more  effectively  than  by  introducing  the  most  ingenious  cipher.  The 
great  practical  lesson  of  World  War  I cryptology  was  the  necessity  of  infusing 
an  iron  discipline  in  the  cryptographic  personnel.  Errors  arising  from 
ignorance  can  be  reduced  by  explaining  how  enemy  cryptanalysts  take 
advantage  of  what  appears  to  be  the  most  trivial  violation  of  the  rules.  Faults 
arising  from  laziness  can  be  lessened  by  a monitoring  service  that  finds  and 
punishes  offenders.  Givierge  enunciated  the  doctrine  that  must  be  impressed 
upon  the  cipherers:  “Encode  well  or  do  not  encode  at  all.  In  transmitting 
cleartext,  you  give  only  a piece  of  information  to  the  enemy,  and  you  know 
what  it  is;  in  encoding  badly,  you  permit  him  to  read  all  your  correspondence 
and  that  of  your  friends.” 

All  these  developments,  however,  resulted  essentially  from  the  inter- 
reaction between  cryptology  and  the  outside  world;  they  were  externally 
oriented.  World  War  I originated  no  developments  that  were  internally 
oriented,  as,  for  example,  was  the  emergence  of  the  field  cipher.  On  the 
contrary,  two  of  the  most  central  activities — the  actual  cryptographic 
operations,  which  were  performed  by  hand,  and  the  techniques  of  solution, 
which  were  brute  frequency  analysis — had  exhausted  their  usefulness. 

Manual  systems  sagged  under  message  loads  for  which  they  were  never 
designed.  Not  a few  cryptographic  clerks  dreamed  of  machines  that  would  lift 
the  onerous  burden  from  their  shoulders.  In  a sense,  the  codes  that  became  so 
popular  might  be  regarded  as  a rudimentary  form  of  mechanical  device  that 
does  the  work  for  the  encoder:  the  phrases  are  prepared  and  equated  with 
their  code  equivalents  in  advance,  and  the  encoder  has  but  to  pick  out  the 
ones  he  wants.  But  the  trench  codes  were  to  the  printing  cipher  machines  of 
later  years  as  the  taxis  of  the  Marne  were  to  the  armored  troop-carriers  of 
Panzer  columns.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

At  the  same  time,  the  classic  principles  of  frequency  analysis  had  been 
stretched  to  their  utmost.  They  were  applied  with  great  subtlety,  as  in  Painvin’s 
matching  of  frequency  distributions  to  determine  the  odd  and  even  columns 
of  the  adfgvx  transposition  block.  But  no  new  principles  had  been  evolved, 
and  the  old  ones  had  barely  coped  with  such  concepts  as  fractionation. 

In  these  two  internal  matters,  which  lie  at  the  core  of  cryptology,  World 
War  I marked  not  a beginning  but  an  end,  had  reaped  not  fulfillment  but 
barrenness.  So  viable  had  the  science  become,  however,  that  this  very 
vacuum,  this  want,  held  promise.

TWO  AMERICANS 


the  most  famous  cryptologist  in  history  owes  his  fame  less  to  what  he 
did  than  to  what  he  said — and  to  the  sensational  way  in  which  he  said  it.  And 
this  was  most  perfectly  in  character,  for  Herbert  Osborne  Yardley  was  per- 
haps the  most  engaging,  articulate,  and  technicolored  personality  in  the 
business. 

He  was  born  April  13,  1889,  in  Worthington,  Indiana,  and  grew  up  in  that 
little  Midwestern  town  during  the  tranquil,  sunlit  years  that  preceded  the 
First  World  War.  A popular  youngster,  he  was  president  of  his  high-school 
class,  editor  of  the  school  paper,  and  captain  of  the  football  team,  and  though 
only  an  average  student,  he  had  a flair  for  mathematics.  From  16  on  he 
frequented  the  poker  tables  of  the  local  saloons,  learning  the  game  that  was  to 
be  a passion  of  his  life.  He  had  wanted  to  become  a criminal  lawyer,  but 
instead  landed  at  23  as  a $900-a-year  code  clerk  in  the  State  Department. 

It  was  a case  of  purest  serendipity,  for  the  man  and  the  subject  were  ideally 
matched.  His  romantic  mind  thrilled  to  the  stream  of  history  that  daily 
poured  through  his  hands  in  the  form  of  ambassadorial  dispatches,  and 
cryptology  fired  his  imagination.  He  had  heard  vague  tales  of  cryptanalysts 
who  could  pry  into  secrets  of  state,  and  when  a 500-word  message  from 
Colonel  House  passed  over  the  wires  to  President  Wilson  one  night,  Yardley, 
with  characteristic  audacity,  determined  to  see  whether  he  could  solve  what 
must  be  the  most  difficult  of  American  codes.  He  astonished  himself  by 
solving  it  in  a few  hours.*  His  success  cemented  his  attachment  to  crypt- 
analysis, and  he  followed  this  demonstration  of  the  low  estate  of  high-level 
cryptography  with  a 100-page  memorandum  on  the  solution  of  American 
diplomatic  codes.  While  absorbed  in  possible  solutions  for  a proposed  new 

* The  President  and  his  advisor  were  then  using  two  main  systems.  One  was  external — a 
superencipherment  applied  to  the  five-digit  numerical  groups  of  what  probably  was  a State 
Department  code.  The  first  digit  was  enciphered  by  one  of  two  alternate  letters;  the  two 
pairs  by  a vowel-consonant  combination.  Thus,  in  one  edition  of  the  superencipherment, 
40606  became  feded,  40699,  kedir,  and  so  on.  The  other  was  internal — a jargon  code  of 
such  less-than-Stygian  incognitos  as  mars  for  the  Secretary  of  War,  neptune  for  the 
Secretary  of  the  Navy,  bluefields  for  William  C.  Redfield,  Secretary  of  Commerce,  alley 
for  Franklin  K.  Lane,  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  and  mansion  for  David  F.  Houston, 
Secretary  of  Agriculture.  Yardley  does  not  specify  which  he  solved.

coding  method,  he  diagnosed  what  has  ever  since  been  known  among 
cryptologists  as  the  “Yardley  symptom”:  “It  was  the  first  thing  I thought  of 
when  I awakened,  the  last  when  I fell  asleep.” 

Soon  after  the  American  declaration  of  war  in  April  of  1917,  he  sold  the 
idea  of  a cryptologic  service  to  the  War  Department.  He  succeeded  partly 
because  the  need  was  genuine,  partly  because  he  himself  was  an  exceedingly 
convincing  young  man.  Yardley  had  proven  his  cryptanalytic  ability,  and 
moreover  had  done  well  enough  in  his  regular  duties  to  have  won  raises  to 
$1,400  in  43  months.  Major  Ralph  H.  Van  Deman,  later  to  be  known  as  the 
Father  of  American  Intelligence,  commissioned  the  thin,  balding  27-year-old 
as  a lieutenant  and  set  him  up  as  the  head  of  the  newly  created  cryptologic 
section  of  the  Military  Intelligence  Division,  MI-8. 

Like  Topsy,  MI-8  just  grew.  First  to  arrive,  to  take  charge  of  the  instruc- 
tion subsection  for  training  A.E.F.  cryptanalysts,  was  Dr.  John  M.  Manly,  a 
52-year-old  philologist  who  headed  the  Department  of  English  at  the  Univer- 
sity of  Chicago  and  was  later  president  of  the  Modern  Language  Association; 
a longtime  hobbyist  in  cryptology,  he  was  to  become  Yardley’s  chief  assistant 
and  one  of  his  best  cryptanalysts.  Manly  brought  with  him  a bevy  of  Ph.D.’s 
clanking  with  Phi  Beta  Kappa  keys,  mostly  from  the  University  of  Chicago: 
David  H.  Stevens,  32,  an  instructor  in  English,  later  director  of  the  division 
for  the  humanities  of  the  Rockefeller  Foundation;  Thomas  A.  Knott,  37, 
associate  professor  of  English  and  later  general  editor  of  Webster’s  Diction- 
aries, including  the  colossal  1934  Second  New  International  Unabridged; 
Charles  H.  Beeson,  47,  associate  professor  of  Latin,  later  president  of  the 
Mediaeval  Academy  of  America,  who  had  gotten  his  doctorate  at  Munich 
and  knew  German  well  enough  to  write  scholarly  works  in  it ; and  Frederick 
Bliss  Luquiens,  41,  professor  of  Spanish  at  Yale  University,  general  editor  of 
the  Macmillan  Spanish  Series,  and  author  of  An  Introduction  to  Old  French 
Phonology  and  Morphology. 

The  instruction  subsection  did  its  teaching  at  the  Army  War  College.  It 
advanced  far  enough  to  offer  as  Problem  20  “General  Principles  of  attack  on 
enciphered  code  when  the  book  is  known  but  the  system  of  encipherment 
unknown.”  Another  subsection  popped  into  being  for  code  and  cipher  com- 
pilation; it  produced  a military  intelligence  code,  two  geographical  codes  for 
combat  information  from  France,  and  a casualty  code,  which  was  never  used. 
Soon  a communications  subsection  was  handling  close  to  50,000  words  a 
week.  As  the  organization  expanded,  it  shifted  to  ever-larger  quarters. 
Beginning  in  the  balcony  overhanging  the  library  of  the  War  College,  MI-8 
moved  to  the  Colonial,  an  apartment  house  at  15th  and  M Streets  barely 
ready  for  occupancy,  and  then  to  a building  on  the  site  of  what  is  now  the 
Capitol  Theatre  on  F Street,  all  in  Washington.  For  security,  its  offices  were 
always  on  the  top  floor. 

Growth  continued  apace.  An  intercepted  letter  in  a German  shorthand 
instigated  a shorthand  subsection  that  soon  could  read  missives  in  more  than 


Two  Americans

30  systems,  most  commonly  Gabelsberger,  Schrey,  Stolze-Schrey,  Marti, 
Brockaway,  Duploye,  Sloan-Duployan,  and  Orillana.  A blank  piece  of  paper 
discovered  in  the  shoe  heel  of  a woman  suspected  of  working  with  German 
espionage  in  Mexico  turned  out  to  bear  a message  in  invisible  ink.  Fortun- 
ately, it  proved  one  of  the  simpler  kinds,  which  can  be  developed  by  heat.  But 
it  sparked  the  establishment  of  a secret-ink  subsection  whose  expert  chemists 
could  detect  writing  in  an  invisible  ink  disguised  as  a perfume  with  an  actual 
odor  and  with  only  one  part  in  10,000  of  solid  matter. 

The  Germans  later  replaced  inks  in  so  bulky  and  conspicuous  a form  as 
liquids  with  chemicals  that  were  impregnated  into  scarves,  socks,  and  other 
garments.  They  had  only  to  be  dipped  in  water  to  create  the  writing  fluid. 
These  miracles  of  the  test  tube,  called  f and  p inks  by  the  British  chemists  who 
taught  the  Americans  much  of  what  they  knew,  were  so  precisely  formulated 
that  they  would  react  with  only  one  other  chemical  to  form  a visible  com- 
pound. 

Eventually,  the  Allied  chemists  discovered  a reagent  that  brought  out 
secret  writing  in  any  kind  of  ink,  even  clear  water.  Crystals  of  iodine,  heated 
gently,  sublimated  into  fumes  of  a beautiful  violet  hue  that  settled  more 
densely  in  those  fibers  of  paper  that  had  been  disturbed  by  any  kind  of  wetting 
action,  thus  tracing  the  pen’s  course.  The  Germans  replied  by  writing  in  a 
sympathetic  ink  and  then  moistening  the  entire  sheet.  The  Allies  struck  back 
with  a chemical  streak  test  that  would  show  whether  the  paper  surface  had 
been  dampened.  This  was  almost  as  incriminating  as  actual  development  of  a 
secret-ink  letter,  for  who  but  a spy  would  wet  a letter?  The  seesaw  battle 
between  the  chemists  of  Germany,  traditionally  world  leaders  in  that  science, 
and  those  of  the  Allies  reached  a stalemate  when  both  sides  discovered  the 
general  reagent — one  that  would  develop  any  secret  ink  at  any  time,  even  on 
moistened  paper.  Formulas  differ  slightly,  but  all  use  a mixture  of  iodine, 
potassium  iodide,  glycerine,  and  water,  dabbed  on  with  cotton.  The  liquid 
concentrates  in  the  more  disturbed  fibers  and  reveals  the  writing.  By  the  time 
this  general  reagent  appeared,  MI-8’s  secret-ink  subsection  was  testing  2,000 
letters  a week  for  invisible  writing  and  had  discovered  50  of  major  importance. 
Among  them  were  letters  that  led  to  the  capture  of  Maria  de  Victorica,  a 
beautiful  German  spy  who  was  planning  to  import  high  explosives  for  sabo- 
tage inside  the  hollow  figures  of  saints  and  the  Virgin  Mary! 

MI-8  also  solved  cryptograms.  It  read  diplomatic  telegrams  of  Argentina, 
Brazil,  Chile,  Costa  Rica,  Cuba,  Germany,  Mexico,  Spain,  and  Panama.  The 
Spanish-language  texts  constituted  the  bulk  of  its  cryptanalytic  work.  The 
censorship  office  sent  over  intercepted  cipher  letters;  most  of  these  turned  out 
to  be  merely  personal  notes  in  very  simple  systems,  though  some  of  the  love 
letters  were  so  torrid  that  Yardley  said,  “It  rather  worried  me  to  see  husbands 
and  wives  trust  their  illicit  correspondence  to  such  unsafe  methods.” 

Perhaps  the  most  important  of  the  MI-8  solutions  was  the  one  that  largely 
resulted  in  the  conviction  of  the  only  German  spy  condemned  to  death  in  the

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


United  States  during  World  War  I.  This  was  Lothar  Witzke,  alias  Pablo 
Waberski,  who  was  suspected  of  setting  off  the  Black  Tom  explosion.  He  was 
captured  in  January,  1918,  by  an  American  agent,  who  found  in  his  baggage 
in  the  Central  Hotel  in  Nogales,  Mexico,  a cipher  letter  dated  January  15.  It 
did  not  reach  MI-8  until  spring,  and  then  it  kicked  about  for  a few  more 
months  while  several  men  there  tried  and  failed  to  solve  it.  Finally  Manly 
took  it  up. 

This  quiet  scholar,  who  never  married  and  whose  quiet,  simple  manner 
contrasted  so  sharply  with  his  chief’s,  was  to  become  one  of  the  world’s 
leading  authorities  on  Chaucer.  He  and  his  collaborator,  Edith  Rickert, 
labored  for  14  years  to  produce  their  monumental  eight-volume  work,  The 
Text  of  the  Canterbury  Tales,  in  which,  by  a tedious  collation  of  scribal  errors 
and  variant  readings  in  more  than  80  manuscripts  of  the  medieval  masterpiece, 
they  reconstructed  a text  that  is  as  close  to  the  poet’s  own  original  as  the 
extant  evidence  allows.  The  cast  of  mind  that  can  thus  sort  out,  retain,  and 
then  organize  innumerable  details  into  a cohesive  whole  was  just  what  was 
needed  for  the  Gothic  complexity  of  the  424-letter  Witzke  cryptogram.  In  a 
three-day  marathon  of  cryptanalysis,  Manly,  aided  by  Miss  Rickert,  per- 
ceived the  pattern  of  this  1 2-step  official  transposition  cipher,  with  its  multiple 
horizontal  shiftings  of  three-  and  four-letter  plaintext  groups  ripped  apart  by 
a final  vertical  transcription.  He  drew  forth  a message  from  Heinrich  von 
Eckardt,  the  luckless  German  minister  in  Mexico  whose  very  involvement 
with  a cryptogram  seemed  to  mean  its  cryptanalysis,*  to  the  German  consular 
authorities: 

The  bearer  of  this  is  a subject  of  the  Empire  who  travels  as  a Russian 
under  the  name  of  Pablo  Waberski.  He  is  a German  secret  agent.  Please 
furnish  him  on  request  protection  and  assistance;  also  advance  him  on 
demand  up  to  1,000  pesos  of  Mexican  gold  and  send  his  code  telegrams  to 
this  embassy  as  official  consular  dispatches.”  When  Manly  read  this  to  a 
military  commission  of  colonels  and  generals  who  were  trying  Witzke  on  spy 
charges  in  a hushed  courtroom  at  Fort  Sam  Houston,  San  Antonio,  the 
effect  was  condemnatory.  The  handsome  young  spy  was  sentenced  to  death. 
Wilson  later  commuted  it  to  life  imprisonment,  however,  and  Witzke  was 
released  in  1923. 

In  August  of  1918,  Yardley  sailed  for  Europe  to  learn  as  much  as  he 
could  from  America’s  allies.  He  obtained  entrance  to  M.I.  1(b)  after  demon- 
strating his  abilities  to  Brooke-Hunt  and  there  studied  British  methods  for  the 
solution  of  different  codes  and  ciphers.  The  doors  of  Room  40  remained 
resolutely  locked  against  him  as  against  everyone  else,  though  Hall  did  give 
him  a German  naval  code  and  a neutral  nation’s  diplomatic  codes.  In  Paris 

* In  addition  to  this  and  the  Zimmermann  telegram,  two  messages  to  the  diplomat  from 
his  home  office,  encoded  in  the  English-French  half  of  Clifton’s  Nouveau  Dictionnaire 
Francois , which  had  replaced  the  betrayed  Cipher  13040,  were  solved  by  MI-8.  They  dis- 
closed Germany  trying  to  bribe  Mexico  to  remain  neutral.

that  fall,  Yardley  met  Painvin,  who  gave  him  a desk  in  his  office  and  invited 
him  to  his  home  many  evenings.  But  he  never  gained  access  to  the  French 
Foreign  Ministry  cryptanalytic  bureau. 

He  remained  in  Paris  after  the  Armistice  to  head  the  cryptologic  bureau 
of  the  American  delegation  to  the  Peace  Conference.  At  first  there  was  a 
tremendous  rush  to  get  organized,  but  then  the  pressure  eased,  and  Yardley, 
Childs,  who  was  assigned  to  assist  him,  and  Lieutenant  Frederick  Livesey, 
who  had  been  sent  over  from  MI-8,  enjoyed  the  life  of  playboy  cryptologists. 
A practical  soul,  Yardley  saw  no  need  for  the  three  officers  assigned  to  the 
bureau  to  be  present  at  once,  and  so  a rotation  of  duties  was  arranged  that 
permitted  them  to  spend  most  of  their  time  at  the  international  cocktail 
parties  and  dancings  that  were  then  the  rage  of  Paris. 

When  it  ended,  as  it  had  to,  Yardley,  viewing  with  distaste  a return  to  the 
State  Department  code  room,  and  burning  with  evangelical  fervor  over 
America’s  need  for  cryptanalysis,  exercised  his  potent  salesmanship  on  the 
State  and  War  departments.  He  won  the  concurrence  of  Frank  L.  Polk,  the 
acting  Secretary  of  State;  then,  on  May  16,  1919,  he  submitted  to  the  Chief 
of  Staff  a plan  for  a “permanent  organization  for  code  and  cipher  investiga- 
tion and  attack.”  Three  days  later  the  Chief  of  Staff  approved  it,  and  Polk 
brown-penciled  an  “O.K.”  and  his  initials  on  it.  The  plan  envisioned  joint 
financial  support  by  the  two  departments  at  about  $100,000  a year,  but 
actual  expenditures  never  reached  that  sum.  The  State  Department’s  contribu- 
tion of  $40,000,  which  began  on  July  15,  1919,  could  not  be  legally  expended 
within  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  so  Yardley  soon  found  himself  moving 
the  nucleus  of  a staff  (largely  recruited  from  MI-8)  and  the  necessary  para- 
phernalia— language  statistics,  maps,  newspaper  clippings,  dictionaries — to 
New  York  City. 

By  October  1 the  organization  that  was  to  become  known  as  the  American 
Black  Chamber  was  ensconced  in  the  former  town  house  of  T.  Suffern  Tailer, 
a New  York  society  man  and  political  leader,  at  3 East  38th  Street.  It  stayed 
there  little  more  than  a year,  however,  before  moving  to  new  quarters  in  a 
four-story  brownstone  at  141  East  37th  Street,  just  east  of  Lexington  Avenue. 
It  occupied  half  of  the  ornate,  divided  structure,  whose  high  ceilings  did  little 
to  relieve  the  claustrophobic  construction  of  its  twelve-foot-wide  rooms. 
Yardley’s  apartment  was  on  the  top  floor.  All  external  connection  with  the 
government  was  cut.  Rent,  heat,  office  supplies,  light,  Yardley’s  salary  of 
$7,500  a year,  and  the  salaries  of  his  staff  were  paid  from  secret  funds. 
Though  the  office  was  a branch  of  the  Military  Intelligence  Division,  War 
Department  payments  did  not  begin  until  June  30,  1921. 

Among  the  twenty  people  who  started  with  Yardley  or  joined  him  soon 
thereafter  were  Dr.  Charles  J.  Mendelsohn  from  MI-8,  a philologist  who 
taught  history  at  City  College  mornings  and  worked  in  the  Black  Chamber 
afternoons;  Victor  Weiskopf,  also  from  M 1-8,  a former  agent  of  and  cryptanalyst 
for  the  Justice  Department,  which  allowed  him  to  join  Yardley’s  organization

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

in  New  York  but  paid  him  $200  a month  to  solve  ciphers  for  it  on  the  side; 
Livesey,  who  had  been  with  Yardley  in  Paris,  a Harvard  graduate  and 
businessman  who  later  became  a State  Department  economic  advisor;  Ruth 
Willson  and  Edna  Ramsaier  (who  was  to  become  Yardley’s  second  wife), 
both  specialists  in  Japanese  ciphers;  and  John  Meeth,  Yardley’s  chief  clerk. 
Livesey,  who  became  Yardley’s  prime  assistant,  was  paid  $3,000,  or  about 
$60  a week. 

One  of  the  organization’s  first  assignments  was  to  solve  the  codes  of 
Japan,  with  whom  friction  had  been  growing.  Yardley,  in  an  access  of 
enthusiasm,  promised  the  solution  or  his  resignation  within  the  year.  He 
regretted  his  impetuousness  as  soon  as  he  plunged  into  the  task,  for  he  almost 
foundered  in  the  Oriental  intricacies  of  Japanese  plaintext,  to  say  nothing  of 
codetext.  After  some  preliminary  study,  assisted  by  Livesey,  who  had  a great 
aptitude  for  languages,  he  ascertained  that  the  Japanese  employed  a watered- 
down  form  of  their  ideographic  writing  called  “kata  kana”  for  telegraphic 
and— presumably — cryptologic  communication,  which  was  transmitted  in 
Latin  letters.  Kata  kana  consists  of  about  73  syllables,  each  with  a sign  of 
its  own  which  had  been  given  a roman  equivalent,  and  when  Yardley  had  his 
typists  compile  frequency  tables  for  the  twenty-five  plain-language  kata  kana 
telegrams  he  had,  he  discovered  that  this  script  obeyed  rules  of  frequency  just 
like  any  other.  Specifically,  the  kana  n,  the  only  nonsyllabic  kana,  was  most 
common,  appearing  often  at  the  end  of  words,  followed  by  no,  o,  ni,  shi, 
wa,  ru , and  to,  in  that  order.  The  list  of  most  common  syllables  and  words 
began  with  ari  and  continued  with  aritashi,  daijin,  denpoo,  gai,  gyoo,  and  so 
on.  At  the  end  of  about  four  months,  the  typists  had  prepared  elaborate  statis- 
tics of  frequency  and  contact  for  about  10,000  kana. 

He  then  set  them  to  work  dividing  the  ten-letter  groups  of  the  Japanese 
code  telegrams  into  pairs  of  letters  and  drawing  up  similar  frequency  and 
contact  data  for  these  pairs.  He  himself  went  through  the  approximately  100 
code  telegrams  underlining  with  colored  pencils  all  repetitions  of  four  letters 
or  more.  But  despite  the  most  intensive  scrutiny  and  study,  no  solution  was 
forthcoming.  Livesey’s  linguistic  abilities  had  meanwhile  brought  him  a fair 
acquaintance  with  Japanese.  He  found  in  a bilingual  dictionary  that  he  had 
bought  for  75  cents  that  the  word  owari  meant  “conclusion.”  Could  it  be  the 
plaintext  of  certain  codegroups  found  frequently  at  the  end  of  telegrams  ? The 
hypothesis,  involving  only  three  kana,  proved  barren.  He  examined  the  plain- 
language  telegrams  and  pointed  out  probable  words  with  conspicuous  patterns 
to  Yardley.  Two  of  these,  which  played  a vital  role  in  the  solution,  were 
“Airurando  dokuritsu”  (“Ireland  independence”),  with  the  repeated  do,  and 
“Doitsu”  (“Germany”),  which  used  three  of  the  same  kana  in  a different 
order.  This  was  a good  clue,  but  it  alone  was  not  the  answer.  Night  after 
night  Yardley  would  climb  the  stairs  to  his  apartment,  weary,  hopeless,  dis- 
couraged, and  fall  into  bed,  only  to  wake  up  excitedly  a few  hours  later  with 
a brilliant  idea — which  invariably  turned  out  to  be  just  another  blind  alley.

By  now  [he  wrote]  I had  worked  so  long  with  these  code  telegrams  that  every 
telegram,  every  line,  even  every  code  word  was  indelibly  printed  in  my  brain. 
I could  lie  awake  in  bed  and  in  the  darkness  make  my  investigations — trial  and 
error,  trial  and  error,  over  and  over  again. 

Finally  one  night  I awakened  at  midnight,  for  I had  retired  early,  and  out  of 
the  darkness  came  the  conviction  that  a certain  series  of  two-letter  codewords 
absolutely  must  equal  Airurando  (Ireland).  Then  other  words  danced  before  me 
in  rapid  succession : dokuritsu  (independence),  Doitsu  (Germany),  owari  (stop). 
At  last  the  great  discovery!  My  heart  stood  still,  and  I dared  not  move.  Was  I 
dreaming  ? Was  I awake  ? Was  I losing  my  mind  ? A solution  ? At  last — and  after 
all  these  months ! 

I slipped  out  of  bed  and  in  my  eagerness,  for  I knew  I was  awake  now,  I 
almost  fell  down  the  stairs.  With  trembling  fingers  I spun  the  dial  and  opened 
the  safe.  I grabbed  my  file  of  papers  and  rapidly  began  to  make  notes. 

These  promptly  proved  his  intuitions  correct.  The  repetitions  of  re  for 
do,  bo  for  tsu,  ok  for  ri,  and  ub  for  i in  his  equivalences  confirmed  it: 

WI  UB  PO  MO  IL  RE  RE  OS  KO  BO  RE  UB  BO  AS  FY  OK 
a i ru  ra  n do  do  ku  ri  tsu  do  i tsu  o wa  ri 

For  an  hour  Yardley  filled  in  these  and  other  identifications  and  then,  con- 
vinced that  the  opening  wedge  had  been  driven,  went  upstairs,  awoke  his  wife, 
and  went  out  to  get  drunk.  Actually,  considerably  more  work  had  to  be  done 
before  the  Black  Chamber  could  read  anything  approaching  sentences.  Much 
of  this  was  done  by  Livesey,  who  achieved  an  important  secondary  break- 
through when  he  identified  the  Japanese  plaintext  jooin  (“Senate”)  and 
jooyakuan  (“draft  treaty”). 

Yardley  encountered  unexpected  difficulties  in  finding  a translator  for  the 
exotic  language,  but  finally  located  a kindly,  bewhiskered  missionary.  He 
looked  joltingly  incongruous  in  the  Black  Chamber,  but  he  enabled  Yardley 
to  send  the  first  translations  of  Japanese  telegrams  to  Washington  in  February 
of  1920.  He  quit  after  six  months  when  he  finally  realized  the  espionage  nature 
of  the  work,  but  by  then  Livesey  had  accomplished  the  almost  unheard-of 
feat  of  learning  Japanese  in  that  time. 

Yardley  called  the  first  code  “Ja,”  the  “J”  for  Japanese,  the  “a”  a serial  for 
the  first  solution.  From  1919  to  the  spring  of  1920  the  Japanese  introduced 
eleven  different  codes,  having  employed  a Polish  expert,  Captain  Kowalefsky, 
to  revise  their  cryptologic  systems.  Kowalefsky  taught  the  Japanese  how  to 
bi-,  tri-,  and  tetrasect  their  messages:  to  divide  them  into  two,  three,  or  four 
parts,  shuffle  the  parts,  and  then  encipher  them  in  transposed  order  to  bury 
stereotyped  beginnings  and  endings.  Some  of  the  codes  contained  25,000 
code  groups. 

During  the  summer  of  1921,  the  Black  Chamber  solved  telegram  813  of 
July  5 from  the  Japanese  ambassador  in  London  to  Tokyo.  It  contained  the

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


first  hints  of  a conference  for  naval  disarmament — an  idea  that  powerfully 
gripped  the  imagination  of  a war-weary  world.  Another  indication  came  when 
Japan  suddenly  introduced  a new  code,  the  yu,  for  their  most  secret  messages. 
On  solution,  it  was  dubbed  “Jp” — the  sixteenth  solved  since  Yardley’s  original 
break. 

A few  months  before  the  November  opening  of  the  disarmament  conference 
in  Washington,  daily  courier  service  was  set  up  between  the  Black  Chamber 
and  the  State  Department.  An  official  grinningly  remarked  that  State’s  upper 
echelons  were  delighted  with  the  cryptanalysts’  work  and  read  the  solutions 
every  morning  with  their  orange  juice  and  coffee.  The  conference  sought  to 
limit  the  tonnage  of  capital  ships,  and  as  negotiations  were  proceeding  toward 
its  chief  result — the  Five-Power  Treaty  that  accorded  tonnages  in  certain 
ratios  to  the  United  States,  Britain,  France,  Italy,  and  Japan — Yardley’s 
team  was  reading  the  secret  instructions  of  the  negotiators.  “The  Black 
Chamber,  bolted,  hidden,  guarded,  sees  all,  hears  all,”  he  wrote  later,  rather 
melodramatically.  “Though  the  blinds  are  drawn  and  the  windows  heavily 
curtained,  its  far-seeking  eyes  penetrate  the  secret  conference  chambers  at 
Washington,  Tokyo,  London,  Paris,  Geneva,  Rome.  Its  sensitive  ears  catch 
the  faintest  whisperings  in  the  foreign  capitals  of  the  world.” 

Each  nation  naturally  tried  to  obtain  the  most  favorable  tonnage  ratio 
for  itself;  the  most  aggressive  in  its  efforts  was  Japan,  which  even  then  was 
dreaming  expansionist  dreams  in  Asia  but  feared  to  offend  the  United 
States.  At  the  height  of  the  conference,  when  Japan  was  demanding  a ratio 
of  10  to  7 with  the  United  States  and  Great  Britain,  the  Black  Chamber  read 
what  Yardley  later  called  the  most  important  telegram  it  ever  solved. 

“It  is  necessary  to  avoid  any  clash  with  Great  Britain  and  America, 
particularly  America,  in  regard  to  the  armament  limitation  question,”  the 
Japanese  Foreign  Office  cabled  its  ambassador  in  Washington  on  November 
28.  “You  will  to  the  utmost  maintain  a middle  attitude  and  redouble  your 
efforts  to  carry  out  our  policy.  In  case  of  inevitable  necessity  you  will  work  to 
establish  your  second  proposal  of  10  to  6.5.  If,  in  spite  of  your  utmost  efforts, 
it  becomes  necessary  in  view  of  the  situation  and  in  the  interests  of  general 
policy  to  fall  back  on  your  proposal  No.  3,  you  will  endeavor  to  limit  the 
power  of  concentration  and  maneuver  of  the  Pacific  by  a guarantee  to  reduce 
or  at  least  to  maintain  the  status  quo  of  Pacific  defenses  and  to  make  an 
adequate  reservation  which  will  make  clear  that  [this  is]  our  intention  in 
agreeing  to  a 10  to  6 ratio.  No.  4 is  to  be  avoided  as  far  as  possible.” 

Each  0.5  in  the  ratio  meant  50,000  tons  of  capital  ships,  or  about  a battle- 
ship and  a half.  With  the  information  in  this  message  telling  the  American 
negotiators  that  Japan  would  yield  if  pressed,  all  they  had  to  do  was  press. 
This  Secretary  of  State  Charles  Evans  Hughes  did,  and  on  December  10 
Japan  capitulated,  instructing  its  negotiator,  in  a cable  read  by  the  Black 
Chamber,  that  “there  is  nothing  to  do  but  accept  the  ratio  proposed  by  the 
United  States.”  As  signed,  the  Five-Power  Treaty  allotted  capital  ships  to  the 


Two  Americans 


359 


United  States,  Great  Britain,  Japan,  France,  and  Italy  in  the  ratio  of 
10 : 10 : 6 : 3.3  : 3.3.  It  was  considerably  less  than  Japan  had  hoped  for.  Hughes 
sent  Yardley  a letter  of  commendation. 

During  the  conference,  the  Black  Chamber  had  turned  out  more  than 

5.000  solutions  and  translations.  Yardley  nearly  suffered  a nervous  break- 
down, and  in  February  went  to  Arizona  for  four  months  to  recover  his 
health.  Several  of  his  assistants  had  already  had  trouble  in  this  regard.  One 
babbled  incoherently;  a girl  dreamed  of  chasing  around  the  bedroom  a bull- 
dog that,  when  caught,  had  “code”  written  on  its  side;  another  could  lighten 
the  enormous  sack  of  pebbles  that  she  carried  in  a recurring  nightmare  only 
by  finding  a stone  along  a lonely  beach  that  exactly  matched  one  of  her 
pebbles,  which  she  could  then  cast  into  the  sea.  All  three  resigned. 

Security  was  a constant  preoccupation.  Mail  was  sent  to  a cover  address; 
Yardley’s  name  was  not  permitted  in  the  telephone  book;  locks  were  often 
changed.  Nevertheless,  some  foreign  government  must  have  discovered  the 
organization’s  activities,  for  there  was  at  least  one  attempt  to  subvert  Yardley 
and,  when  this  failed,  the  office  was  broken  into  and  the  desks  rifled.  After 
this  the  Black  Chamber  moved  to  a large  office  building  at  52  Vanderbilt 
Avenue,  where,  by  1925,  it  had  set  up  the  Code  Compiling  Company  as  a 
rather  unsubtle  cover.  The  firm,  with  Yardley  as  president  and  Mendelsohn 
as  secretary-treasurer,  actually  compiled  the  Universal  Trade  Code,  which 
they  sold,  together  with  other  commercial  codes.  Behind  this  front  office,  in  a 
locked  room,  worked  the  cryptanalysts.  Though  each  piece  of  paper  was 
scrupulously  locked  away  each  night  so  that  nothing  was  left  on  the  desks, 
the  cryptanalysts  were  allowed,  in  those  more  informal  days,  to  take  home 
problems  on  which  they  Were  working. 

Yardley’s  appropriation  had  been  severely  cut  in  1924,  and  half  the  staff 
had  to  be  let  go,  reducing  the  force  to  about  a dozen.  Despite  this,  Yardley 
said,  the  Black  Chamber  managed  to  solve,  from  1917  to  1929,  more  than 

45.000  telegrams,  involving  the  codes  of  Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  China, 
Costa  Rica,  Cuba,  England,  France,  Germany,  Japan,  Liberia,  Mexico, 
Nicaragua,  Panama,  Peru,  San  Salvador,  Santo  Domingo  (later  the  Domini- 
can Republic),  the  Soviet  Union,  and  Spain,  and  made  preliminary  analyses 
of  many  other  codes,  including  those  of  the  Vatican. 

Suddenly  it  all  ended.  Yardley,  who  had  been  obtaining  the  code  tele- 
grams of  foreign  governments  through  the  cooperation  of  the  presidents  of  the 
Western  Union  Telegraph  Company  and  the  Postal  Telegraph  Company, 
was  encountering  increasing  resistance  from  them.  Herbert  Hoover  had  just 
been  inaugurated,  and  Yardley  resolved  to  settle  the  matter  with  the  new 
administration  once  and  for  all.  He  decided  on  the  bold  stroke  of  drawing  up 
“a  memorandum  to  be  presented  directly  to  the  President,  outlining  the 
history  and  activities  of  the  Black  Chamber,  and  the  necessary  steps  that 
must  be  taken  if  the  Government  had  hoped  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  skill 
of  its  cryptographers.”  He  waited  to  see  which  way  the  wind  was  blowing 


360 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


before  making  his  move — and  found  that  it  was  not  with  him.  Yardley  went 
to  a speakeasy  to  listen  to  Hoover’s  first  speech  as  President  and  sensed,  in  the 
high  ethical  strictures  that  Hoover  expressed,  the  doom  of  the  Black  Chamber. 

He  was  right,  though  its  actual  closing  came  from  elsewhere.  After  Henry 
L.  Stimson,  Hoover’s  Secretary  of  State,  had  been  in  office  the  few  months 
that  Yardley  thought  would  be  necessary  for  him  to  have  lost  some  of  his 
innocence  in  wrestling  with  the  hardheaded  realities  of  diplomacy,  the  Black 
Chamber  sent  him  the  solution  of  an  important  series  of  messages.  But  Stim- 
son was  different  from  previous  Secretaries  of  State,  on  whom  this  tactic  had 
always  worked.  He  was  shocked  to  learn  of  the  existence  of  the  Black 
Chamber,  and  totally  disapproved  of  it.  He  regarded  it  as  a low,  snooping 
activity,  a sneaking,  spying,  keyhole-peering  kind  of  dirty  business,  a violation 
of  the  principle  of  mutual  trust  upon  which  he  conducted  both  his  personal 
affairs  and  his  foreign  policy.  All  of  this  it  is,  and  Stimson  rejected  the  view 
that  such  means  justified  even  patriotic  ends.  He  held  to  the  conviction  that 
his  country  should  do  what  is  right,  and,  as  he  said  later,  “Gentlemen  do  not 
read  each  other’s  mail.”  In  an  act  of  pure  moral  courage,  Stimson,  affirming 
principle  over  expediency,  withdrew  all  State  Department  funds  from  the 
support  of  the  Black  Chamber.*  Since  these  constituted  its  major  income, 
their  loss  shuttered  the  office.  Hoover’s  speech  had  warned  Yardley  that  an 
appeal  would  be  fruitless.  There  was  nothing  to  do  but  close  up  shop.  An 
unexpended  $6,666.66  and  the  organization’s  files  reverted  to  the  Signal  Corps, 
where  William  Friedman  had  charge  of  cryptology.  The  staff  quickly  dis- 
persed (none  went  to  the  Army),  and  when  the  books  were  closed  on  October 
31,  1929,  the  American  Black  Chamber  had  perished.  It  had  cost  the  State 
Department  $230,404  and  the  War  Department  $98,808.49— just  under  a 
third  of  a million  dollars  for  a decade  of  cryptanalyis. 

Yardley,  whose  job  experience  had  been  rather  specialized,  could  not  find 
work,  and  he  went  back  home  to  Worthington.  The  Depression  sucked  him 
dry.  By  August  of  1930,  he  had  had  to  give  up  an  apartment  house  and  a one- 
eighth  interest  in  a real  estate  corporation;  indeed,  he  complained  that  he  had 
to  sell  nearly  everything  he  owned  “for  less  than  nothing.”  A few  months  later 
he  was  toying  with  the  idea  of  writing  the  story  of  the  Black  Chamber  to  make 
some  money  to  feed  his  wife  and  their  son,  Jack.  When  his  old  MI-8  friend, 
Manly,  with  whom  he  had  been  in  contact  all  during  the  1920s,  had  to  turn 
down  his  request  for  a $2,500  loan  at  the  end  of  January,  1931,  Yardley,  in 
desperation,  sat  down  to  write  what  was  to  be  the  most  famous  book'on 

* In  1940,  as  Secretary  of  War,  he  had  to  reverse  himself  and  accept  the  cryptanalyses  of 
magic.  But  the  international  situation  then  was  totally  different.  “In  1929,”  he  himself  has 
written,  in  the  third  person,  “the  world  was  striving  with  good  will  for  lasting  peace,  and  in 
this  effort  all  the  nations  were  parties.  Stimson,  as  Secretary  of  State,  was  dealing  as  a 
gentleman  with  the  gentlemen  sent  as  ambassadors  and  ministers  from  friendly  nations. 

. . .”  In  1940,  Europe  was  at  war,  and  the  United  States  was  on  the  verge.

cryptology  ever  published.  He  described  the  composition  of  it  in  a letter  to 
Manly  in  the  spring  of  1931 : 

I hadn’t  done  any  real  work  for  so  long  that  I told  Bye,  my  agent,  and  the 
Sat  Eve  Post  that  I would  need  some  one  else  to  write  the  stuff.  I showed  a few 
things  to  Bye  and  Costain,  the  latter  editor  of  post,  and  both  told  me  to  go  to 
work  myself.  I sat  for  days  before  a typewriter,  helpless.  Oh,  I pecked  away  a bit, 
and  gradually  under  the  encouragement  of  Bye  I got  a bit  of  confidence.  Then 
Bobbs  Merrill  advanced  me  $1000  on  outline.  Then  there  was  a call  to  rush  the 
book.  I began  to  work  in  shifts,  working  a few  hours,  sleeping  a few  hours,  going 
out  of  my  room  only  to  buy  some  eggs,  bread,  coffee  and  cans  of  tomatoe  juice. 
Jesus,  the  stuff  I turned  out.  Sometimes  only  a thousand  words,  but  often  as 
many  as  10,000  a day.  As  the  chapters  appeared  I took  them  to  Bye  who  read 
them  and  offered  criticism.  Anyway  I completed  the  book  and  boiled  down  parts 
of  it  for  the  articles  all  in  7 weeks. 

The  Bobbs-Merrill  Company,  of  Indianapolis,  published  the  375-page 
book  on  June  1,  but  parts  of  it  had  already  appeared  in  three  articles  at  two- 
week  intervals  in  The  Saturday  Evening  Post,  the  leading  magazine  of  the  day, 
which  thought  so  highly  of  them  that  it  used  the  first  of  the  series  to  lead  its 
April  4 issue.  Yardley  was  a superb  storyteller,  and  his  narrative  skill  did  not 
desert  him  on  paper.  Largely  owing  to  this  and  to  his  vigorous  and  pungent 
style,  the  book  itself,  The  American  Black  Chamber,  was  an  immediate 
success,  and  it  instantly  fixed  itself  in  popular  lore  as  the  epitome  of  books  on 
cryptology.  Even  today,  it  is  invariably  mentioned  in  any  cocktail-party 
discussion  of  the  subject,  and  copies  remain  in  demand  among  secondhand- 
book  dealers.  Reviews  of  it  were  unanimously  good.  Critic  W.  A.  Roberts, 
in  a commendatory  review,  summed  up  the  prevailing  opinion : “I  think  it  the 
most  sensational  contribution  to  the  secret  history  of  the  war,  as  well  as  the 
immediate  post-war  period,  which  has  yet  been  written  by  an  American.  Its 
deliberate  indiscretions  exceed  any  to  be  found  in  the  recent  memoirs  of 
European  secret  agents.”  Reporters  hastened  to  governmental  bureaus  to 
inquire  whether  it  was  all  true.  The  State  Department,  with  masterfully 
diplomatic  double-talk,  was  “disposed  to  discredit”  Yardley’s  statements.  At 
the  War  Department,  officials  lied  straightforwardly  and  said  that  no  such 
organization  had  been  in  existence  in  the  past  four  years. 

But  beneath  this  bland  surface  American  cryptologists  seethed.  Friedman 
was  incensed  at  what  he  regarded  as  an  unwarranted  slur  on  the  A.E.F. 
cryptologic  effort.  Yardley  had  learned  from  a report  by  Moorman  about 
Childs’s  test-stripping  of  the  superencipherment  from  the  proposed  but  never 
used  A.E.F.  Trench  Code  and  about  the  telephone  monitoring  of  the  messages 
that  allowed  the  g.2  a. 6 monitor  to  deduce  the  American  attack  on  the  St.- 
Mihiel  salient.  He  inadvertently  combined  them  into  a highly  dramatic  tale  in 
which  the  Germans  knew  from  cryptanalysis  about  the  American  effort  to 
flatten  the  salient,  which  consequently  “represents  only  a small  part  of  what 


362 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


might  have  been  a tremendous  story  in  the  annals  of  warfare,  had  the  Germans 
not  been  forewarned.  The  stubborn  trust  placed  in  inadequate  code  and 
cipher  systems  had  taken  its  toll  at  the  Front.”  Yardley  was  not  entirely  to 
blame,  for  Moorman’s  report  is  extremely  confusing  and  does  not  clearly 
separate  the  two  episodes,  but  he  ignored  the  frequent  replacement  of  code- 
books, unwarrantedly  assumed  that  the  Germans  cryptanalyzed  the  messages, 
and  in  general  did  not  check  out  his  facts. 

Friedman  circularized  his  A.E.F.  colleagues  to  ask  their  views.  Moorman 
replied,  “1  started  to  read  the  Yardley  articles,  but  finding  that  their  object 
seemed  to  be  exaggeration  of  the  importance  of  the  writer  with  little  regard 
for  the  truth,  I did  not  finish.  I have  been  surprised  at  the  number  of  indivi- 
duals who  can  write  quite  plausibly  on  the  subject,  ‘How  1 Won  the  War,’ 
and  it  was  with  some  regret  that  I discovered  Yardley  had  joined  them.” 
Hitt  wrote,  “I  have  never  seen  in  a reputable  magazine  any  series  of  articles 
so  full  of  misstatement  of  fact,  uncalled  for  criticism  and  innuendo  as  those 
by  Yardley.  A great  national  weekly  has  permitted  him  to  pose  before  its 
readers  as  one  of  the  outstanding  heroes  of  the  war,  poor  fellow,  and  he  had 
to  lie  to  do  it.” 

Manly,  who  at  first  had  warned  Yardley  that  “you  might  incur  very  serious 
criticism  if  you  disclosed  the  fact  that  you  had  been  reading  the  official 
messages  of  the  Foreigner,”  told  him  after  the  articles  appeared  that  “I 
approve  the  articles  and  think  that  they  are  well  done.”  To  Friedman,  who 
had  compared  Yardley ’s  disclosure  of  American  cryptanalysis  to  a lawyer’s 
breach  of  ethics  by  disclosing  confidential  material  of  his  client,  Manly  wrote 
that  he  himself  would  not  have  revealed  any  of  the  cryptanalytic  matters 
dealing  with  friendly  nations,  but  felt  that  Yardley’s  motive  was  to  force  the 
government  to  set  up  a cryptanalytic  bureau.  Friedman  replied  that  “In  my 
opinion  the  great  harm  he  has  done  our  country  will  not  become  fully  appar- 
ent for  many  years  to  come.”  Some  was  probably  apparent  almost  immedi- 
ately, for  at  least  some  of  the  19  nations  named  as  having  their  codes  broken 
must  have  changed  them.  One  Army  cryptanalyst  recalled  that  publication  of 
the  book  caused  him  and  his  colleagues  considerable  extra  work  at  the  time. 

Yardley  himself  seems  to  have  been  taken  a bit  aback  by  the  storm  he  had 
kicked  up.  He  had  at  first  admitted  frankly  to  Manly  that  “if  I didn’t  dramat- 
ise them  [the  book  and  articles]  in  some  manner  the  reader  would  go  to  sleep” 
nnd  To  write  saleable  stuff  one  must  dramatise.  Things  don’t  happen  in 
dramatic  fashion.  There  is  therefore  nothing  to  do  but  either  dramatise  or  not 
write  at  all.”  But  when  he  saw  he  had  a tiger  by  the  tail  he  assumed  a sancti- 
monious attitude.  “Would  it  not  appear,”  he  rhetorically  asked  in  a letter  to 
the  editor  of  the  New  York  Evening  Post,  “that  if  such  practices  [reading  other 
nations’  messages]  are  to  be  eliminated  from  the  considerations  of  diplomacy 
the  first  step  toward  such  elimination  must  be  an  airing,  publicly,  of  the 
situation?  . . It  seems  to  me  that  my  book  may  possibly  render  a real  public 
service  in  at  least  pointing  out  the  conditions  existing  as  the  first  step  toward 


Two  Americans 


363 


achieving  their  remedy.”  He  took  the  offensive  against  his  critics  with  an 
article  in  Liberty  magazine  entitled  “Are  We  Giving  Away  Our  State  Secrets  ?” 
In  this  he  accused  the  Department  of  State  of  gross  negligence  in  crypto- 
graphic matters — “sixteenth-century  codes,”  he  had,  with  some  justice, 
called  them  in  his  book— and  asserted  that  his  book  should  have  been  taken, 
not  “as  a story  of  romance,”  but  “as  an  expose  of  America’s  defenseless 
position  in  the  field  of  cryptography.” 

It  was,  however,  as  a story  of  romance  that  The  American  Black  Chamber 
sold  17,931  copies,  unprecedented  for  a book  dealing  with  cryptology,  and  a 
highly  respectable  figure  even  today.  The  English  edition,  entitled  Secret 
Service  in  America , sold  5,480  more.  The  book  was  published  in  French,  in 
Swedish,  and  in  an  unauthorized  Chinese  version,  but  it  was  in  Japan,  as 
might  be  expected,  that  sales  skyrocketed.  On  a per-capita  basis,  Japanese 
sales  of  33,119  copies  were  almost  four  times  better  than  in  the  United 
States. 

It  stirred  a tremendous  furor  there.  On  July  22,  1931,  the  Tokyo  Nichi 
Nichi,  one  of  the  most  influential  papers  in  Japan,  published  a long  article 
giving  various  views  on  the  book.  Everyone  tried  to  save  face  by  throwing  the 
blame  on  the  Foreign  Ministry.  Typical  was  the  comment  of  an  unnamed 
member  of  the  House  of  Peers,  who  contended  that  Baron  Kujiro  Shidehara, 
then  foreign  minister  and  at  the  time  of  the  conference  ambassador  to  the 
United  States,  “must  be  held  responsible.”  He  added,  "The  disclosure  of  this 
breach  of  faith  committed  by  the  United  States  Government  will  doubtless 
serve  as  a valuable  lesson  for  the  future  to  Japan  in  participating  in  inter- 
national conferences.”  Baron  Nagayasu  Ikeda,  a bitter  critic  of  Shidehara, 
declared  that  “The  Japanese  authorities  are  really  foolish.”  The  Foreign 
Ministry  had  to  concede  that  the  American  solution  “was  due  to  failure  of 
the  Japanese  Government  to  effect  a change  in  ciphers  occasionally.”  Then  it 
tried  to  make  the  United  States  lose  face  by  calling  the  solution  “a  dishonor,” 
and  sought  to  tar  Yardley  with  the  statement  that  at  the  time  of  the  con- 
ference he  had  “visited  the  Japanese  embassy  in  Washington  and  stated  that 
Japan’s  cipher  telegrams  were  all  deciphered  and  then  proposed  to  sell  the 
translations.  Mr.  Yardley  is  such  a man”— unquestionably  false.  A naval 
officer  expressed  amazement  that  such  a book  could  be  published  “even  in 
the  United  States,”  regret  that  the  United  States  permitted  the  solution,  and 
assurance  that  the  Japanese  Navy  “has  taken  great  trouble  to  preserve  the 
secrecy  of  wireless  telegrams.”  The  Army,  after  criticizing  the  Foreign 
Ministry’s  “serious  blunder”  in  not  changing  ciphers  just  before  the  con- 
ference, promised  to  give  it  advice. 

One  English-language  paper  after  another  in  Japan  reported  the  con- 
siderable interest”  or  “mild  sensation"  or  "serious  sensation  that  Yardley  s 
revelations  were  causing  in  official  circles.  The  respected  Osaka  Mainichi 
reported  that  the  War  and  Navy  ministries  had  instructed  their  attaches  in 
Washington  to  purchase  several  copies  of  the  book,  and  stated  that  they  are 


364 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


“determined  to  enter  the  proposed  Geneva  Conference  [on  limiting  armed 
forces]  with  all  the  precaution  in  the  world.”  Two  of  the  English-language 
papers  took  diametrically  opposed  editorial  views  of  the  solution.  The 
Japan  Chronicle  said,  very  Britishly,  “It  is  so  much  like  steaming  open  people’s 
letters — a thing  which  is  distinctly  not  done,”  but  the  Japan  Times  coolly 
remarked  that  “trying  to  decipher  the  other  nation’s  code  is  part  of  the  game” 
and  that  “about  all  that  one  can  do  is  to  criticise  the  Foreign  Office  rather 
than  rail  against  the  Americans  for  scoring  against  our  own  team.” 

Interest  long  remained  high.  On  November  5,  1931,  Ambassador  W. 
Cameron  Forbes  reported  to  the  State  Department,  which  had  asked  “to  be 
kept  fully  informed”  about  the  Yardley  agitation,  that  “The  ‘Black  Chamber’ 
evidently  made  a great  impression  in  Japan.  I often  hear  reference  made  to  it 
in  conversation  with  various  classes  of  Japanese.  According  to  the  publishers 
of  the  Japanese  edition,  more  than  40,000  copies  have  been  sold.  It  remains 
a best  seller  at  the  present  time.”  Contrary  to  some  published  reports,  how- 
ever, it  did  not  cause  the  government  to  fall  (Would  that  books  on  cryptology 
were  that  powerful!),  nor  Japan  to  lodge  protests  with  the  United  States  or 
repudiate  the  Five-Power  Treaty  three  years  later.  It  did  cause  Japan  to  start 
treating  American  naval  officers  there  to  study  the  language  with  suspicion. 
It  did  impress  itself  so  indelibly  on  the  Japanese  conscience  that,  when 
Shigenori  Togo  became  foreign  minister  ten  years  later,  he  recalled  the 
episode  and  checked  to  see  whether  Japanese  communications  were  then 
secure.  And  it  contributed  to  anti-American  and  antiwhite  feeling  in  Japan. 

Consequently,  when  Stanley  K.  Hornbeck,  a Far  Eastern  expert  in  the 
Department  of  State,  heard  that  Yardley  had  written  a new  book,  entitled 
“Japanese  Diplomatic  Secrets,”  revealing  many  Japanese  telegrams  sent 
during  the  1922  naval  disarmament  conference,  he  wrote  in  a memorandum 
of  September  12,  1932:  “I  cannot  too  strongly  urge  that,  in  view  of  the  state 
of  excitement  which  apparently  prevails  in  Japanese  public  opinion  now, 
characterized  by  fear  of  or  enmity  toward  the  United  States,  every  possible 
effort  should  be  made  to  prevent  the  appearance  of  this  book.  Its  appearance 
would  contribute  substantially  to  the  amount  of  explosive  material  which 
seems  to  be  piling  up  in  Japan.”  Apparently  as  a result  of  this,  United  States 
marshals  seized  the  manuscript  on  February  20,  1933,  at  the  offices  of  The 
Macmillan  Company,  to  whom  Yardley  had  submitted  it  after  Bobbs- 
Merrill  had  declined  it,  on  the  grounds  that  it  violated  a statute  prohibiting 
agents  of  the  United  States  government  from  appropriating  secret  documents. 
A Macmillan  editor  and  Yardley 's  literary  agent,  George  T.  Bye,  were  escorted 
before  the  federal  grand  jury  by  the  Chief  Assistant  United  States  Attorney 
in  New  York,  a man  who  later  achieved  fame  in  other  areas,  Thomas  E. 
Dewey.  No  criminal  prosecution  ensued  against  either  of  them  or  against 
Yardley. 

Instead,  the  government  sought  to  pass  a law  in  Congress  aimed  straight 
at  Yardley.  “Whoever,  by  virtue  of  his  employment  by  the  United  States,”  the 


Two  Americans 


365 


bill  read,  “obtains  from  another  or  has  or  has  had  custody  or  access  to  any 
official  diplomatic  code  or  any  matter  prepared  in  any  such  code,  or  which 
purports  to  have  been  prepared  in  any  such  code,  and  without  authorization 
or  competent  authority,  willfully  publishes  or  furnishes  to  another  any  such 
code  or  matter,  or  any  matter  which  was  obtained  while  in  the  process  of 
transmission  between  any  foreign  government  and  its  diplomatic  mission  in 
the  United  States,  shall  be  fined  not  more  than  $10,000  or  imprisoned  not 
more  than  10  years,  or  both.” 

As  originally  introduced  in  the  House  of  Representatives  at  the  request  of 
the  State  Department  by  Hatton  W.  Sumners,  a Texas  Democrat,  the  bill— 
H.R.  4220,  “For  the  Protection  of  Government  Records”— was  longer  and 
more  elaborate  than  the  final  version,  presented  above,  though  with  essentially 
the  same  substance.  In  debate,  some  Representatives  charged  a State  Depart- 
ment cover-up.  Others  questioned  whether  the  bill  would  penalize  persons 
who  might  present  plaintext  versions  of  American  messages  that  had  been 
transmitted  in  encoded  form.  The  persons  they  were  particularly  concerned 
with  were  members  of  Congress  and  newspapermen.  As  a result  of  these 
considerations,  the  Senate,  when  it  got  the  House  bill,  substituted  its  own 
version.  This  was  hustled  through  the  chamber  while  its  opponents  were  out 
and  was  actually  passed ; but  when  the  great  California  Republican,  Hiram  W . 
Johnson,  twice  governor  of  California  and  once  a vice  presidential  candidate, 
returned  to  the  chamber  and  found  out  what  had  been  done  in  his  absence,  he 
asked  for  and  received  unanimous  consent  to  have  the  bill  reconsidered. 

Two  days  later,  on  May  10,  1933,  in  the  midst  of  the  momentous  Congres- 
sional session  that  enacted  the  major  reform  measures  of  the  New  Deal,  the 
Senate  held  its  great  debate  on  the  cryptologic  bill.  Harry  F.  Byrd  of  Virginia, 
in  his  first  term  in  the  Senate,  was  presiding.  Key  Pittman  of  Nevada,  a 
Democrat  and  the  administration’s  sponsor  for  the  bill  in  the  Senate,  declared 
that  “In  my  opinion  it  is  unconscionable  for  trusted  employees  to  publish 
private  correspondence  between  governments  which  they  obtain  by  virtue  of 
their  office.  That  is  all  that  is  covered  in  the  measure,  in  my  opinion.”  But 
Homer  T.  Bone  of  Washington,  also  a Democrat,  had  a question.  “I  am 
rather  curious  to  know  [how]  it  is  that  we  have  managed  to  go  along  from  the 
First  Congress  to  the  Seventy-Third  without  this  sort  of  legislation.  What  is 
the  purpose  of  it  at  this  time?”  Pittman  replied,  “Mr.  President,  I will  state 
that  in  the  past  our  Government  apparently  has  been  very  fortunate  in  having 
trusted  employees  in  these  extremely  confidential  positions.  It  has,  however, 
recently  found,  or  believe  it  has  found,  that  there  are  grounds  for  suspecting 
that  that  confidence  has  been  violated,  and  may  be  violated  again."  At  this 
juncture  a letter  from  Secretary  of  State  Cordell  Hull  was,  in  the  jargon  of  the 
legislators,  spread  on  the  record,  stating  that  restrictions  on  the  press  were 
not  even  remotely  considered  in  State’s  proposing  the  bill.  Then  Johnson  took 
the  floor,  and,  his  indignation  tempered  by  his  humor,  attacked  the  bill  as  a 
threat  to  individual  liberty: 


366 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


On  its  face  the  bill  is  as  conventional  as  a wedding  and  as  respectable  as  a 
funeral.  . . . But  ...  it  does  not  accomplish  the  result  that  was  set  forth  when  the 
bill  was  presented.  . . . 

It  happened  that  on  a certain  day  young  gentlemen  from  the  State  Depart- 
ment rushed  into  the  Capitol  here,  and  said  that,  as  a matter  of  emergency,  in 
order  that  guns  should  not  rumble  at  our  doors,  we  should  forthwith  pass  this 
measure.  Indeed,  so  persuasive  were  they  with  the  House  that  the  House 
considered  it  without  ever  telling  its  Members  why  it  was  presented  and  without 
Members  of  the  House  knowing  at  all  the  subject  matter  of  the  bill  or  the  reason 
for  the  emergency.  . . . That  emergency  was  a month  and  a half  ago,  and  the  bill 
has  been  pending  ever  since,  but  nobody  has  heard  of  any  of  the  dreadful  and 
terrible  things  occurring  that  it  was  asserted  were  going  to  happen  unless  this 
bill  should  forthwith  become  the  law  of  the  land.  So  the  reason  for  the  passage  of 
the  bill,  so  first  vehemently  asserted,  does  not  exist  now  and,  calmly  scrutinizing 
the  past,  never  did  exist. 

He  then  referred,  for  the  first  time  in  the  Congressional  debate,  to  Yardley 
and  his  book,  which  he  had  read  and  found  “more  or  less  interesting.”  He 
criticized  Yardley  for  violating  “every  rule  that  relates  to  fiduciary  relations,” 
and  pointed  out  that  he  had  written  another  book  containing  disarmament 
conference  messages. 

It  was  then  that  the  great  “emergency”  arose.  His  manuscript,  as  I understand, 
was  confiscated,  and  after  its  confiscation,  then  into  the  Halls  of  Congress  came 
these  frightened  gentlemen  to  say  that  it  was  such  a delicate,  perilous  and  im- 
mediate emergency  that  they  had  to  have  a new  criminal  statute.  That  was  the 
first  of  April  or  thereabouts  of  this  year.  So  this  proposed  statute  was  born. 
Immediately  upon  the  bill  being  passed  by  the  House — and  it  was  passed  in  such 
fashion  that  no  one  knew  anything  about  it  until  it  had  been  passed — the 
members  of  the  press  set  up  the  usual  howl  of  the  press  about  the  freedom  of  the 
press  and  how  this  sort  of  statute  would  interfere  with  them.  The  result  was  that, 
of  course,  everybody  ran  to  cover  and  the  bill  was  amended  in  the  twinkling  of  an 
eye  in  order  that  the  press  should  not  be  interfered  with  and  the  freedom  of 
the  press  at  all  hazards  should  be  preserved.  . . . 

Let  us  look  at  the  bill  as  presented.  I am  speaking  more  or  less  academically 
in  respect  to  this  matter.  I do  not  believe  in  creating  unnecessary  crimes.  If  it  be 
essential  that  a crime  should  be  created  in  order  that  punishment  shall  be  meted 
out,  I can  recognize,  of  course,  that  it  is  proper  for  the  legislature  to  undertake 
it;  but  unless  an  absolute  necessity  exists,  I do  not  like  the  idea  of  creating 
additional  crimes.  Here  is  a bill  designed  to  fit  a particular  case.  It  is  a misfit  and 
never  will  touch  that  case.  It  will  rest  upon  the  statute  books,  a criminal  law  with 
harsh  penalties,  until — far  in  the  future,  when  its  original  purpose  will  have  been 
forgotten — it  will  be  used  for  another  purpose  for  which  it  was  never  intended 
and  may  do  gross  wrong.  That  has  ever  been  the  story  of  this  kind  of  law  made 
to  fit  some  past  particular  offense. 

Johnson  began  to  read  the  bill — “Whoever,  by  virtue  of  his  employment 
by  the  United  States,  obtains  from  another.  . .” — but  was  interrupted  by 
Senator  George  W.  Norris  of  Nebraska: 


Two  Americans  367 

MR.  norris:  Mr.  President,  should  he  not  be  guilty?  If  he  does  such  a terrible 
thing  as  that,  should  he  not  be  guilty  of  a crime? 
mr.  Johnson:  Obtaining  from  another? 
mr.  norris:  Yes. 

mr.  Johnson:  Yes,  I think  so.  In  these  days  anybody  that  obtains  anything  from 
another  ought  to  be  most  condignly  punished  if  he  gets  it,  but  the  difficulty 
is  with  most  of  us  that  while  we  strive  we  do  not  succeed.  ( Laughter ) 

Then  Tom  Connally  of  Texas,  another  Administration  manager  of  the  bill, 
rebutted  Johnson’s  arguments: 

What  is  proposed  to  be  done  by  this  measure  ? All  the  bill  would  do  is  simply  to 
make  it  a criminal  offense  for  a scoundrel  to  betray  his  confidential  relationship 
with  the  Government,  or  for  another  to  conspire  with  some  agent  of  the  Govern- 
ment to  get  confidential  information,  and  then  go  out  and  sell  it  for  money.  . . . 
My  contention  is  that  any  citizen  . . . who  is  in  the  employ  of  the  Government 
and,  having  access  to  confidential  papers  and  records,  disloyally  and  improperly 
uses  knowledge  so  obtained  for  private  gain  or  private  profit  ought  to  be 
punished.  ...  Mr.  President,  what  is  there  so  wrong  about  this  measure? 
What  is  there  so  terrible  about  it?  Where  is  the  Senator  who  approves  pilfering 
private  records?  If  there  be  such,  let  him  rise.  Senators  who  become  enraged 
because  of  a man’s  stealing  a spotted  calf  and  want  to  put  him  in  the  penitentiary 
would  seem  to  entertain  the  idea  that  a man  could  sell  a public  record  or  a public 
document  and  sell  it  for  money  to  the  newspapers  and  that  that  would  be  an  act 
of  patriotism  and  public  service.  I do  not  so  regard  it.  . . . 

We  are  interfering  with  free  thieving  and  free  betrayal  of  trust ; that  is  what 
we  are  interfering  with.  We  are  interfering  with  free  treachery  to  their  employer 
and  to  the  Government,  that  is  all. 

This  view,  abetted  by  the  political  influence  of  the  Administration,  pre- 
vailed. By  a voice  vote  the  Senate  passed  the  bill.  A conference  committee  of 
Senators  and  Representatives  decided  in  favor  of  the  Senate’s  bill  and  con- 
vinced the  House  to  accept  it.  On  June  10,  President  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt 
signed  it,  making  it  Public  Law  37,  and  it  lies  today  on  the  statute  books  as 
Section  952  of  Title  18,  United  States  Code. 

Four  days  later,  the  Bobbs-Merrill  Company  petitioned  the  State  Depart- 
ment for  approval  to  carry  out  a 1931  contract  with  Blue  Ribbon  Books  to 
reprint  15,000  copies  of  The  American  Black  Chamber.  Evidently  the  firm, 
not  wanting  to  take  any  chances  under  the  new  law,  was  seeking  a State 
Department  blessing  to  safeguard  it  against  a Justice  Department  prosecu- 
tion. It  told  the  State  Department  that  it  would  suffer  a heavy  financial  loss 
if  it  had  to  make  good  its  contract  with  Blue  Ribbon  without  getting  any 
return  on  sales. 

On  July  13,  William  Phillips,  the  acting  Secretary  of  State  (who,  ironic- 
ally, had  personally  allowed  Yardley  to  resign  from  the  State  Department  in 
1917  to  form  MI-8),  replied:  “The  granting  by  this  Department  of  such  a 


368 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


permission  would  imply  that  the  Department  felt  no  objection  to  the 
publication  and  distribution  of  the  book  and  would  in  a measure  associate 
the  Department  with  action  on  the  part  of  the  author  and  the  publisher  upon 
which  it  has  not  at  any  time  looked  with  approval.”  The  department,  he 
continued,  was  therefore  unable  to  grant  the  permission.  But  the  department 
did  not  want  to  contribute  to  the  company’s  financial  loss,  Phillips  wrote,  and 
so  it  would  take  no  action  to  prevent  the  sale  or  distribution  of  the  4,500  copies 
already  printed  by  Blue  Ribbon.  From  this  refusal  of  the  State  Department 
to  grant  its  “permission”  for  republication — though  some  of  its  officials  had 
wondered  privately  whether  such  permissions  were  part  of  State’s  business — 
grew  a legend  that  The  American  Black  Chamber  had  been  suppressed,  though 
no  action  had  been  taken  in  regard  to  the  many  copies  already  in  circulation. 

Yardley  remained  unperturbed  throughout  the  whole  commotion.  Though 
he  had  availed  himself  of  the  opportunity  provided  by  his  senator,  Arthur 
R.  Robinson  of  Indiana,  to  give  his  justifications  for  publishing  The  American 
Black  Chamber  (“It  would,  1 hoped,  awaken  the  conscience  of  the  State 
Department,  so  that  they  would  revise  their  own  code  systems  and  render 
American  diplomatic  secrets  invulnerable  to  attack  by  foreign  crypto- 
graphers”), he  implied  that  he  was  much  too  busy  in  his  laboratory  develop- 
ing a commercial  secret  ink  to  be  interested  in  this  piddling  legislative  trivia. 
The  ink  worked,  but  it  did  not  inundate  the  nation  as  a commercial  success, 
and  Yardley  lost  the  third  finger  of  his  right  hand  through  an  infection  caused 
by  it. 

He  tried  writing  again,  but  his  imagination  seemed  to  need  fact  to  work 
on,  and  his  adventure  novels,  The  Red  Sun  of  Nippon  and  The  Blonde  Countess, 
lacked  the  excitement  of  his  rather  fictionalized  nonfiction.  Metro-Goldwyn- 
Mayer,  however,  found  the  beautiful  woman  spy,  the  secret  codes,  and  the 
infallible  cryptologist  of  The  Blonde  Countess  eminently  suitable  for  its  pur- 
poses. A problem  was  that  no  redblooded  movie  hero  would  settle  for  a dull 
desk  job  like  codebreaking,  but  the  film  company  fixed  that  up  by  destroying 
the  fabric  of  Yardley’s  tale  and  making  the  hero  an  unwilling  intellectual  who 
wanted  only  to  serve  in  the  trenches  overseas.  The  result  was  Rendezvous, 
starring  William  Powell,  Rosalind  Russell,  Binnie  Barnes,  Cesar  Romero, 
and  Lionel  Atwill.  Yardley  was  retained  by  MGM  on  a generous  contract  as 
technical  advisor  and  became  friendly  with  Powell.  The  film  premiered  at 
New  York’s  Capitol  Theatre  on  October  25,  1935.  The  New  York  Times 
reviewed  it  as  a “lively  and  amusing  melodrama.” 

In  1938,  after  a brief  and  unsuccessful  fling  at  real-estate  speculation  in 
Queens,  New  York,  Yardley  was  hired  by  Chiang  Kai-shek  at  about  $10,000 
a year  to  solve  the  messages  of  the  Japanese  armies  then  invading  China.  In 
Chungking,  he  at  first  passed  himself  off  as  an  exporter  of  hides,  but  no  one 
in  the  small  and  tight-knit  foreign  colony  there  was  fooled  for  very  long.  He 
seems  to  have  enjoyed  some  success  in  solving  the  Japanese  ciphers,  which 
appear  to  have  been  columnar  transposition  of  the  kana  symbols.

By  then  he  was  changing.  He  was  basically  an  attractive  personality  who 
enjoyed  simple  masculine  pleasures.  He  would  rise  at  dawn  to  go  duck- 
hunting, shot  a good  enough  game  of  golf  to  have  won  the  Greene  County 
(Indiana)  championship  in  1932,  and  played  poker  with  a compulsive  inten- 
sity wherever  and  whenever  he  could.  He  regaled  his  companions  with  a 
flood  of  amusing  stories,  told  with  the  wit  and  gusto  of  a natural  raconteur. 
He  was  the  very  opposite  of  stuffy,  and  did  not  hesitate  to  admit  that  he  knew 
his  way  around  in  a Chinese  whorehouse.  He  kept  a Chinese  and  a German 
mistress*  and  once  organized  a virtual  Oriental  orgy  for  a young  corre- 
spondent, later  nationally  famous,  on  the  ground  that  it  was  necessary  for  him 
to  be  blooded  as  a man.  He  enjoyed  the  loyalty  and  friendship  of  a great 
many  people,  though  not  everybody  liked  him.  Emily  Hahn,  in  her  China  to 
Me,  said  bluntly  that  she  did  not,  calling  him  “an  American  with  a loud 
manner  of  talking.”  His  original  enterprise,  which  had  enabled  him  to  create 
MI-8  and  the  Black  Chamber,  had  turned  to  opportunism  with  the  publica- 
tion of  his  book,  and  then  had  soured  to  cynicism  under  the  widespread 
disgust  that  followed  that  violation  of  confidence,  and  under  the  realization 
that  he  had  traded  his  soul  for  a few  thousand  dollars. 

He  returned  from  China  in  1940,  and,  after  a brief  attempt  to  be  a 
restaurateur  in  Washington,  went  to  Canada  to  set  up  a cryptanalytic  bureau 
which  dealt  largely  with  spy  ciphers.  He  was  reportedly  forced  out  under 
pressure  either  from  Stimson,  then  Secretary  of  War,  or  from  the  British, 
though  the  Canadians  did  not  want  to  part  with  him.  From  1941  to  the  end 
of  the  war  he  served  as  an  enforcement  officer  in  the  food  division  of  the 
Office  of  Price  Administration.  His  popular  The  Education  of  a Poker  Player, 
in  which  he  offered  an  informal  course  of  instruction  in  the  game,  appeared 
in  1957.  On  August  7,  1958,  he  died  of  a stroke  at  his  home  in  Silver  Spring, 
Maryland,  and  was  buried  with  military  honors  in  Arlington  National 
Cemetery. 

The  obituaries  called  him  “the  father  of  American  cryptography.”  They 
were  wrong,  but  they  demonstrated  the  deep  impression  that  Yardley’s 
writing  had  made  on  the  American  consciousness.  With  all  its  faults  and 
falsehoods,  his  book  had  captured  the  imagination  of  the  public  and  inspired 
untold  numbers  of  amateurs  to  become  interested  in  cryptology.  To  the  extent 
that  the  impact  of  their  fresh  ideas  enriched  American  cryptology,  the  credit 
must  go  to  him. 

While  Herbert  Yardley  may  be  the  best  known  cryptologist,  uncontestably 
the  greatest  is  William  Frederick  Friedman.  Unlike  his  contemporary,  his 
eminence  is  due  most  emphatically  to  what  he  did.  Indeed,  two  more  dissimilar 
men  in  a single  field  can  scarcely  be  imagined.  Where  Yardley  was  Rabe- 
laisian, outgoing,  superficial,  free  and  easy  with  the  details  of  a good  story, 
and  ever  ready  for  the  main  chance,  Friedman  tended  toward  introversion.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


depth  of  study,  personal  security,  timidity,  dedication,  and  accuracy,  nicety, 
and  validity  of  work.  Despite  the  relative  drabness  of  these  personal  traits — 
or  perhaps  because  of  them,  Friedman’s  theoretical  contributions  and  his 
practical  attainments  exceed  those  of  any  other  cryptologist.  Yardley’s 
career  was  like  an  amazing  skyrocket  that  explodes  in  fantastic  patterns 
against  the  heavens.  Friedman’s  was  like  the  sun. 

He  was  born  Wolfe  Friedman  on  September  24,  1891,  in  Kishinev, 
Russia,  the  oldest  son  and  second  child  of  Frederick  and  Rosa  Friedman.  His 
father,  a Rumanian  who  spoke  eight  languages  and  worked  as  an  interpreter 
for  the  Russian  Post  Office,  emigrated  to  America  in  1892,  at  which  time  his 
son’s  name  was  changed  to  William.  The  family  settled  in  Pittsburgh,  where 
his  father  managed  a sewing  machine  agency.  William  graduated  in  1909  as 
one  of  the  ten  honor  students  in  a class  of  300  at  Pittsburgh  Central  High 
School;  he  then  went  to  work  as  chief  clerk  in  the  Erie  City  Iron  Works,  a 
firm  that  sold  steam  engines.  About  that  time  the  back-to-the-farm  movement 
called  to  city  boys,  and  in  the  fall  of  1910,  Friedman  and  three  friends  en- 
rolled in  Michigan  Agricultural  College,  whose  chief  attraction  was  that  it 
was  tuition-free. 

But  Friedman  soon  discovered  that  farming  held  little  interest  for  him. 
He  was  an  inventive  young  fellow  who  liked  to  fix  things  and  had  written 
some  science  fiction  for  his  high-school  paper;  he  was  rapidly  coming  to  the 
conclusion  that  he  liked  science.  At  the  end  of  the  term  he  learned  that  tuition 
was  also  free  in  a scientific  field  allied  to  agriculture — genetics — at  one  of  the 
Ivy  League  universities,  Cornell.  He  borrowed  train  fare  and  arrived  in 
Ithaca,  New  York,  in  February,  1911,  where  he  got  a job  waiting  on  tables. 
After  commencement  in  February  of  1914,  he  attended  graduate  school, 
managing  to  fall  in  love  twice,  once  with  a brunette,  once  with  the  blonde 
daughter  of  a movie-house  owner.  While  he  was  there,  a wealthy  textile 
merchant,  George  Fabyan,  who  maintained  laboratories  in  acoustics,  chemis- 
try, genetics,  and  cryptology  (to  try  to  prove  that  Bacon  wrote  Shakespeare’s 
plays)  on  his  500-acre  estate,  Riverbank,  at  Geneva,  Illinois,  decided  that 
he  needed  a geneticist  to  improve  the  grains  and  livestock  on  his  farm. 
He  applied  to  Cornell  for  a “would-be-er,”  not  an  “as-is-er,”  and  hired 
Friedman,  to  begin  June  1,  1915. 

Fabyan  was  a man  of  no  formal  education  but  of  intelligence  and  energy. 
He  had  a great  desire  to  be  “somebody,”  and  that  desire  motivated  his 
subsidizing  the  Baconian  studies:  proof  of  this  revolutionary  thesis  would 
cover  its  patron  as  well  as  its  actual  discoverers  with  glory.  He  himself  read 
little,  but  he  absorbed  enough  from  those  around  him  to  make  his  talk  on 
almost  any  subject  sound  impressive — at  least  superficially.  He  was  autocratic, 
never  allowing  his  staff  to  disagree  with  him,  but  otherwise  not  unpleasant 
so  long  as  employees  recognized  that  he  was  boss.  A cardinal  article  of  faith 
with  him  was  that  a well-executed  sales  campaign  could  put  across  almost 
anything.

Friedman  did  some  genetics  work  for  him,  but,  because  he  was  handy  with 
a camera,  he  helped  the  cryptologists  who  were  looking  for  Bacon's  cipher- 
signatures  in  Shakespeare  by  making  photographic  enlargements  of  the 
Elizabethan  printing  that  figured  in  the  work.  The  Department  of  Ciphers  of 
the  Riverbank  Laboratories  consisted  of  14  or  15  high-school  and  college 
graduates  who  assigned  the  individual  letters  in  these  Elizabethan  texts  to 
one  or  the  other  of  two  fonts  of  type  as  part  of  the  Baconian  search.  Fabyan 
gave  them  their  living  plus  a salary  of  about  $50  a month.  The  staff  was  ted 
and  housed  in  Engledew  and  Hoover  Cottages,  the  cipher  laboratories  taking 
up  the  first  floor  of  Engledew. 

The  young  woman  who  collated  the  work  of  many  of  the  other  staff 
members  was  Elizebeth  Smith.  She  had  been  born  August  26,  1892,  in 
Huntington,  Indiana,  the  youngest  of  the  nine  children  of  John  M.  Smith,  a 
dairyman,  banker,  and  county  Republican  committeeman,  and  his  wite, 
Sopha,  who  spelled  her  daughter’s  Christian  name  with  an  <?  instead  of  an  a in 
the  middle  because  she  was  not  going  to  have  anyone  calling  her  child 
“Eliza.”  After  completing  high  school  in  Huntingdon,  Elizebeth  attended 
Wooster  College  briefly  but  was  graduated  from  Hillsdale  College  in  Michigan 
where  she  had  majored  in  English.  While  working  at  the  Newberry  Library  in 
Chicago,  she  was  recruited  by  Fabyan  and  began  work  there  in  1916. 

Neither  she  nor  Friedman  had  given  any  particular  previous  thought  to 
cryptology,  but  they  began  to  get  personally  interested  in  the  work.  It  is  yet 
another  of  the  ironies  of  cryptologic  history  that  the  interest  of  two  foremost 
cryptologists  was  aroused  by  a false  doctrine — a doctrine,  moreover,  against 
which  they  later  were  to  wage  a lifetime  battle.  For  at  table  at  the  Riverbank 
cottages  they  heard  gaudy  tales  of  lusty  Elizabethan  life,  of  the  not-so-Virgin 
Queen,  of  courtiers’  intrigues  and  the  secret  histories  of  the  great  names  of 
English  history — all  actually  invalid  decipherments  of  Shakespeare’s  plays 
tending  to  prove  that  Bacon  had  written  them,  related  by  the  gentle,  upright, 
but  self-deluded  woman  who  had  “deciphered”  them,  Mrs.  Elizabeth 
Wells  Gallup.  These  stories  stirred  Friedman’s  dormant  interest;  he  began  to 
do  some  of  the  cryptology,  and  inevitably  its  puissant  magic  seeped  like  the 
fume  of  poppies  into  his  mind  and  spirit  and  intoxicated  him.  When  it  came 
to  the  cryptology,”  he  recalled  years  later,  “something  in  me  found  an  outlet.” 

An  understatement.  He  soon  found  himself  head  of  the  Department  of 
Ciphers  as  well  as  the  Department  of  Genetics  at  Riverbank.  The  attraction 
he  felt  for  cryptology  was  reinforced  by  the  attraction  he  felt  for  a crypto- 
logist: the  quick-witted  and  sprightly  Miss  Smith.  In  May  of  1917  they  were 
married  and  started  the  most  famous  husband-and-wife  team  in  the  history 
of  cryptology. 

America  had  declared  war  a month  before,  and  Riverbank,  which  had  the 
only  going  cryptologic  concern  in  the  country,  began  getting,  on  an  informal 
basis,  cryptograms  for  solution  from  various  government  bureaus.  Probably 
the  most  important  were  messages  to  and  from  a ring  of  125  Hindus  who, 


372 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


with  German  aid,  were  taking  advantage  of  England’s  preoccupation  in 
Europe  to  strike  for  Indian  independence.  The  intercepts  were  given  to 
Friedman  for  solution,  and  he  quickly  solved  the  number  cipher  used  in 
cablegrams  to  Berlin.  The  letters  of  the  plaintext  and  of  the  keyword  were 
transformed  into  digits  by  means  of  a 4x7  checkerboard  with  a normal 
alphabet;  the  key  digits  were  then  added  to  those  of  the  plaintext  to  form  the 
ciphertext.  One  key  was  LAMP.  Each  agent  had  his  own  key,  but  Friedman 
had  no  trouble  in  solving  them.  Nor  was  he  stumped  by  a system  usually 
regarded  by  amateurs  as  the  ne  plus  ultra  of  cryptographic  security:  a book 
cipher. 

It  came  to  him  in  the  form  of  a seven-page  typewritten  letter.  The  writer, 
Heramba  Lai  Gupta,  had  enciphered  only  the  important  words,  leaving 
large  patches  of  cleartext  as  valuable  clues;  he  had  also  repeated  the  equiva- 
lents for  many  letters  instead  of  seeking  new  ones  and  had  employed  neigh- 
boring letters  in  a single  line,  thus  enabling  Friedman  to  reconstruct  the  words 
of  the  keytext  as  a check  upon  and  aid  to  the  solution.  For  example,  Friedman 
guessed  from  context  that  83-1-2  83-1-11  83-1-25  83-1-1  83-1-8  83-1-13 
83-1-18  83-1-3  83-1-1  83-1-6  83-1-3  83-1-6  meant  revolution  in,  with  the 

83  the  page,  the  1 the  line  on  that  page,  and  the  third  number  the  letter  in 
that  line.  (It  is  interesting  to  note  how  the  third  group  sticks  out  as  the  equiva- 
lent for  a low-frequency  letter  by  being  so  far  back  in  the  line.)  This  gave  him 
ori  . . n . l . . e . u . . as  the  start  of  the  key  line,  and  this  in  turn  probably  let 
him  guess  that  the  line  started  with  original  or  originally.  He  would  then  have 
known  that  83-1-4  in  the  very  next  word  was  the  equivalent  for  g in  Bengal. 
By  taking  full  advantage  of  such  clues  he  built  up  the  entire  plaintext  without 
ever  knowing  what  was  later  discovered — that  the  key  book  was  Price  Collier’s 
Germany  and  the  Germans,  a scholarly  work  published  in  New  York  in  1913. 

The  Hindus  were  prosecuted  for  trying  to  purchase  the  uprising’s  arms  in 
the  United  States  and  to  ship  them  from  the  West  Coast.  At  the  mass  trials  in 
Chicago  and  San  Francisco,  Friedman  gave  evidence  that  in  effect  convicted 
the  conspirators  out  of  their  own  mouths.  The  San  Francisco  proceeding 
witnessed  one  of  the  most  dramatic  scenes  ever  to  occur  in  an  American 
courtroom  when  one  defendant  rose,  fired  two  shots  from  a revolver  to 
assassinate  a compatriot  who  was  testifying  for  the  government,  and  was 
himself  killed  by  a marshal  shooting  over  the  heads  of  the  crowd.  In  an  anti- 
climax, a jury  later  found  most  of  the  defendants  guilty. 

A few  months  after  these  Hindu  solutions,  the  British  submitted  five  short 
messages  to  Riverbank  for  tests.  They  had  been  enciphered  by  a cipher  device 
invented  by  J.  St.  Vincent  Pletts  of  M.I.  1(b),  the  British  War  Office  crypt- 
analytic  bureau.  The  machine  was  a modification  of  the  Wheatstone  appara- 
tus, proposed  as  a field  cipher.  So  highly  did  the  British  regard  it  that  one 
argument  advanced  against  its  adoption  was  that  if  the  Germans  captured 
one  and  adopted  it,  the  Allies  would  no  longer  be  able  to  solve  enemy 
messages!  Friedman,  however,  at  once  recovered  the  keyword  CIPHER  to

one  of  the  mixed  alphabets.  But  he  could  not  seem  to  get  anywhere  with  the 
other  keyword  and,  stymied,  he  resorted  to  a bit  of  psychological  cryptanaly- 
sis. He  turned  to  the  new  Mrs.  Friedman,  and  asked  her  to  make  her  mind  a 
blank. 

“Now,”  he  went  on,  “I  want  you  to  tell  me  the  first  word  that  comes  into 
your  mind  when  I say  a word.”  He  paused.  “Cipher,”  he  said. 

“Machine,”  she  replied. 

It  turned  out  to  be  the  very  key  desired.  Three  hours  after  Friedman 
received  the  cryptograms,  their  plaintexts  were  being  cabled  to  London.  (The 
first  one  read,  in  a phrase  dear  to  proud  inventors,  This  cipher  is  absolutely 
undecipherable.)  Needless  to  say,  it  ended  consideration  of  the  Pletts  device  for 
Allied  use. 

In  addition  to  this  cryptanalytical  work,  Friedman  did  most  of  the  teach- 
ing of  a class  of  Army  officers  sent  in  the  fall  of  1917  to  Riverbank’s  Depart- 
ment of  Ciphers  to  learn  cryptology.  For  instruction  in  these  courses,  he 
turned  out  a series  of  technical  monographs.  He  completed  seven  before  he 
went  overseas  to  g.2  a. 6 in  the  spring  of  1918  and  wrote  an  eighth  on  his 
return.  Known  collectively  as  the  Riverbank  Publications,  they  rise  up  like  a 
landmark  in  the  history  of  cryptology.  Nearly  all  of  them  broke  new  ground, 
and  mastery  of  the  information  they  first  set  forth  is  still  regarded  as  the 
prerequisite  for  a higher  cryptologic  education.  Fabyan  sought  to  win  an 
implied  credit  for  them  by  keeping  Friedman’s  name  off  the  title  pages  and  by 
copyrighting  them  in  his  own.  A full  set  of  the  white,  paperbound  pamphlets 
has  become  an  essential  for  a good  collection  of  cryptologia,  but  since  only 
400  copies  were  printed,  they  are  extremely  rare,  and  copies  of  each  pamphlet 
fetch  up  to  $25  apiece  on  the  rare-book  market,  where  they  are  immediately 
snapped  up  on  the  few  occasions  that  they  appear.  One  zealous  amateur 
thought  so  highly  of  them  that  he  painstakingly  copied  them  on  his  typewriter, 
and  photostatic  copies  have  been  purchased  by  collectors  who  despair  of  ever 
getting  the  originals.  Because  Riverbank  had  issued  other  publications,  the 
cryptologic  series  began  with  No.  15. 

It  was  entitled  A Method  of  Reconstructing  the  Primary  Alphabet  from  a 
Single  One  of  the  Series  of  Secondary  Alphabets , and  its  15  pages  comprise 
Friedman’s  first  writing  on  cryptology.  The  primary  alphabet  is  the  mixed 
alphabet  used  to  form  a Vigenere-like  tableau  for  polyalphabetic  encipher- 
ment; the  secondary  alphabet  is  the  one  recovered  by  the  cryptanalyst.  For 
example,  a primary  alphabet  based  on  the  keyword  ABOLISHMENT  may 
be  slid  against  itself  like  this 

plaintext  abol  i shmentcdfgj  kpqruvwxyz 
ciphertext  ntcdfgjkpqruvwxyzaboli  shme 

so  that  plaintext  a = n,  b = t,  o = c,  and  so  on.  The  cryptanalyst,  however, 
not  knowing  the  order  of  the  letters  in  the  plaintext  alphabet,  will  arrange

them  alphabetically  in  his  recovery,  thus  obscuring  the  keyword  in  the  lower, 
or  secondary,  alphabet.  It  will  look  like  this  (to  use  Friedman’s  own  example): 

plaintext  abcdefghij  kl  mnopqrstuvwxyz 
ciphertext  ntuvpwxj  fyzdkqcabogrli  shme 

Friedman  showed  that  the  original  alphabet  could  be  recovered  by  making 
a chain  of  letters  and  then  stretching  them  out  at  trial  intervals  of  1,  2,  3, ...  25 
letters.  To  make  the  chain,  the  cryptanalyst  takes  as  its  first  link  the  letter 
under  a,  which  is  n.  He  then  finds  this  letter  in  the  upper  alphabet  and  takes 
as  the  second  link  the  letter  beneath  it,  or  Q.  He  finds  q in  the  upper  alphabet 
and  takes  as  the  third  link  the  letter  beneath  it,  b.  After  completing  the  chain, 
he  writes  the  letters  out  in  successive  trials,  leaving  ever  wider  spaces  between 
them  until  he  can  see  plaintext  fragments  that  might  form  part  of  the  keyword. 
Usually  he  does  not  have  to  write  out  the  full  chain  before  feeling  that  an 
attempt  is  useless.  In  this  case,  likely  sequences  appear  at  an  interval  of  9 — 
which  is  the  displacement  of  the  two  alphabets.  Completion  of  the  chain  at 
this  interval  will  produce  the  original  ABOLISHMENT  alphabet:

Such  a determination  can  be  of  crucial  importance.  Knowing  the  primary 
alphabet  will  enable  the  cryptanalyst  to  solve  much  more  easily  cryptograms 
based  on  it  but  with  different  periodic  keywords.  He  will  also  be  able  to  solve 
much  shorter  cryptograms.  This  glimpse  of  the  underlying  key  system  may 
help  him  solve  messages  in  other  primary  alphabets.  The  technique  has  many 
implications,  and  cryptanalysts  must  often  be  grateful  to  Friedman  for 
devising  it. 

Riverbank  Publication  No.  16,  Methods  for  the  Solution  of  Running-Key 
Ciphers,  showed  in  its  42  pages  how  to  crack  polyalphabetic  ciphers  keyed 
with  long  texts  to  defeat  Kasiski  analyses.  Friedman  set  up  an  abbreviated 
tableau  in  which  only  the  high-frequency  key  letters  and  plaintext  letters 
appeared  with  their  cipher  equivalents  in  the  known  alphabets.  Given  a 
cryptogram,  “the  first  step  is  to  assume  that  the  key-text  and  plain-text  consist 
solely”  of  those  letters;  the  possible  combinations  that  could  yield  the  actual 
letters  of  the  cryptogram  are  set  out,  and  the  cryptanalyst  attempts  to  ana- 
gram so  that  he  obtains  intelligible  text  in  both  key  and  plain.  He  then  extends 
the  fragments  thus  obtained  by  working  the  one  text  against  the  other.  No.  17, 
An  Introduction  to  Methods  for  the  Solution  of  Ciphers,  was  simply  that.  No.

376  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Literature,  set  out  cipher  systems  in  a tabular  arrangement  similar  to  that 
devised  by  Porta. 

No.  19  was  a highly  original  attempt  to  mechanize  the  solution  of  trans- 
position ciphers.  The  basic  idea  of  Formulae  for  the  Solution  of  Geometrical 
Transposition  Ciphers  was  conceived  by  Lenox  R.  Lohr,  then  a captain  taking 
one  of  the  Riverbank  courses  and  later  president  of  Chicago’s  Museum  of 
Science  and  Industry.  While  the  formulas  worked  perfectly  and  produced 
plaintext  fragments  without  the  cryptanalyst’s  having  tediously  to  write  out 
innumerable  trial  transposition  rectangles,  the  geometrical,  or  route,  trans- 
positions for  which  they  were  designed  were  so  rarely  used  that  the  work  had 
little  practical  value.  Nevertheless,  it  was  a forerunner  of  techniques  used  to- 
day with  electronic  computers.  In  No.  20,  Several  Machine  Ciphers  and 
Methods  for  Their  Solution,  Friedman  amplified  the  de  Viaris  solution  of  the 
Bazeries  cryptograph,  to  which  he  gave  the  generic  name  of  a “multiplex” 
system,  and  devised  a solution  for  the  Wheatstone  cryptograph,  perhaps  based 
on  his  work  with  the  Pletts  device.  No.  21,  Methods  for  the  Reconstruction  of 
Primary  Alphabets,  written  in  collaboration  with  Mrs.  Friedman,  took  up 
where  No.  15  left  off.  It  extended  the  method  of  that  brochure  to  secondary 
alphabets  that  resulted  from  the  interaction  of  two  different  mixed  alphabets 
that  had  been  used  as  the  plain  and  cipher  components. 

Riverbank  Publication  No.  22,  written  in  1920  when  Friedman* was  28, 
must  be  regarded  as  the  most  important  single  publication  in  cryptology.  It 
took  the  science  into  a new  world.  Entitled  The  Index  of  Coincidence  and  Its 
Applications  in  Cryptography,  it  described  the  solution  of  two  complicated 
cipher  systems.  Friedman,  however,  was  less  interested  in  proving  their 
vulnerability  than  he  was  in  using  them  as  a vehicle  for  new  methods  of 
cryptanalysis.  Fabyan  had  the  pamphlet  printed  in  France  in  1922  to  save 
money;  General  Cartier  saw  it  and  thought  so  highly  of  it  that  he  had  it 
translated  and  published  forthwith — false-dating  it  “1921”  to  make  it  appear 
as  if  the  French  work  had  come  first ! 

In  it,  Friedman  devised  two  new  techniques.  One  was  brilliant.  It  per- 
mitted him  to  reconstruct  a primary  cipher  alphabet  without  having  to  guess 
at  a single  plaintext  letter.  But  the  other  was  profound.  For  the  first  time  in 
cryptology,  Friedman  treated  a frequency  distribution  as  an  entity,  as  a curve 
whose  several  points  were  causally  related,  not  as  just  a collection  of  individual 
letters  that  happen  to  stand  in  a certain  order  for  noncausal  (historical) 
reasons,  and  to  this  curve  he  applied  statistical  concepts.  The  results  can  only 
be  described  as  Promethean,  for  Friedman’s  stroke  of  genius  inspired  the 
numerous,  varied,  and  vital  statistical  tools  that  are  indispensable  to  the 
cryptology  of  today. 

The  Index  of  Coincidence  intermingles  the  two  techniques,  but  thev  are 
easier  to  understand  separately.  Furthermore,  the  rudimentary  formula  used 
in  that  publication  for  the  statistical  technique  has  been  superseded  by 
one  growing  out  of  Friedman’s  1925  solution  of  a cipher  machine  using 


Two  Americans

cryptographic  rotors,  or  wired  codewheels.  During  this  analysis  Friedman 
refined  his  theory,  evolving  two  parameters  of  great  importance  in  modern 
cryptology.  Hence,  despite  the  violation  of  chronology,  it  seems  wiser  to 
begin  with  the  improved  theory. 

Imagine  an  urn  containing  one  each  of  the  26  letters  of  the  alphabet.  The 
chance  of  drawing  any  specified  letter,  say  r,  is  one  in  26,  or  1/26.  Now  imagine 
another,  identical  urn.  The  chance  of  drawing  an  r is  equally  one  in  26,  or  1/26. 
What  are  the  odds  on  drawing  a pair  of  r’s,  one  after  another,  in  a two-draw 
situation?  The  likelihood  of  drawing  the  second  r is  1/26  of  the  chance  of 
drawing  the  first,  which  is  1/26.  So  the  chance  of  drawing  two  r’s  in  a single 
event,  or  “simultaneously,”  one  from  each  urn,  is  1/26  x 1/26.  Similarly,  the 
probability  of  drawing  two  a’s  is  1/26  x 1/26,  of  two  b's,  1/26  x 1/26,  and  so 
on.  Consequently,  the  chance  of  drawing  a pair  of  letters — any  pair  of  letters, 
no  matter  which  pair  may  come  up — is  the  sum  of  all  these  probabilities.  It 
is  (1/26 x 1/26) +(1/26 x 1/26)+ ..  . +(1/26x  1/26),  repeated  26  times,  or 
26  x (1/26  x 1/26),  or  1/26.  This  quantity  may  be  written  as  the  decimal  0.0385. 

Assume  now  an  ideal  cryptosystem  whose  ciphertexts  yield  a perfectly 
flat  frequency  count — one  with  as  many  a’s  as  h’s  as  c’s  . . . as  z’s.  Poly- 
alphabetics  approach  this  in  varying  degrees  and  may,  for  practical  purposes, 
be  regarded  as  generating  such  ciphertexts.  These  texts  are  called  “random” 
because  they  are  what  would  be  obtained  if  letters  were  drawn  at  random 
from  the  urn  (each  letter  being  replaced  after  being  noted  and  the  urn  shaken 
to  mix  the  lot,  chance  alone  dictating  their  identities).  If  two  such  random 
texts  are  superimposed,  the  chance  that  the  letter  above  will  be  the  same  as  the 
letter  below  is  the  same  as  the  chance  of  drawing  a pair  of  identical  letters 
from  the  two  urns.  This  is  0.0385,  or,  to  put  it  another  way,  there  will  be  3.85 
such  coincidences  in  every  100  vertical  pairs.  Experiment  will  confirm  this. 

Now  imagine  an  urn  filled  with  100  letters  of  English  in  the  proportion  in 
which  they  are  used  in  normal  text — 8 a’s,  1 b,  3 c’s,  13  e’s,  and  so  on.  The 
chance  of  drawing  a specified  letter  is  now  proportional  to  its  frequency.  The 
probability  that  an  a will  emerge  is  8/100ths,  that  an  e will  is  13/100ths.  With 
two  such  urns,  the  chance  of  drawing  two  a’s  is,  as  before,  the  product  of  the 
individual  probabilities,  or  8/100x8/100;  the  chance  of  drawing  two  c’s  is 
consequently  13/100  x 13/100.  And  the  probability  of  drawing  a pair — any 
pair — of  identical  letters  is  the  sum  of  all  these  pair-probabilities:  (8/100 x 
8/1 00)  + ( 1 / 1 00  x 1/100) +(3/100x3/100) . . . , and  so  on  through  all  26 
letters.  This  calculation  has  been  made  (with  a slightly  different  frequency 
table).  The  result  is  0.0667. 

These  two  plaintext  urns  may  likewise  be  replaced  by  two  strings  of 
plaintext.  If  they  are  superimposed,  there  will  be  as  much  likelihood  that  two 
letters  will  coincide  vertically  as  there  was  that  two  identical  letters  will  be 
drawn  from  the  two  urns.  This  probability  is  0.0667,  or  6.67  coincidences  per 
100  pairs.  For  example:

There  are  just  seven  coincidences  in  the  100  pairs — precisely  what  theory 
predicts. 

The  quantities  0.0385  and  0.0667  are  important  enough  to  be  given  names. 
The  first  is  called  Kr,  read  as  “kappa  sub  r”  (for  random),  the  second  is  kp, 
read  “kappa  sub  p”  (for  plaintext).*  They  will  naturally  differ  for  other 
alphabets  and  other  languages.  In  Russian’s  30-letter  Cyrillic  alphabet,  for 
example,  k r will  be  30x  1/30x  1/30,  or  0.0333.  Changing  frequency  char- 
acteristics alters  xp.  Thus,  it  is  0.0778  for  French,  0.0762  for  German,  0.0738 
for  Italian,  0.0775  for  Spanish,  and  0.0529  for  Russian. 

The  establishment  of  the  kappa  values  permits  the  finding  of  a quick  and 
easy  answer  to  one  of  the  most  important  and  recurring  problems  in  crypt- 
analysis : how  to  superimpose  two  or  more  polyalphabetic  ciphertexts  so  that 
the  letters  in  each  column  will  have  the  same  keyletter.  The  problem  arises  in 
cases  in  which  different  messages  use  the  same  portion  of  a very  long  key, 
such  as  that  generated  by  a machine.  Discovery  of  these  overlaps  opens  the 
door  to  a Kerckhoffs  solution.  A test  based  on  the  kappa  values  and  called 
the  kappa  test’  tells  quantitatively  whether  a given  superimposition  has 
brought  together  identically  enciphered  texts. 

To  understand  it,  one  must  recognize  first  that  the  superimposition  of  two 
monalphabetically  enciphered  texts  will  result  in  the  kp  figure  of  about  6.67 
coincidences  per  100  vertical  pairs,  or  6.67  per  cent  of  coincidences.  This  is 
because  the  coincidences  will  occur  whether  the  letters  are  clothed  in  cipher- 
text  disguises  or  not.  The  calculation  does  not  ask  the  letters  for  their  identi- 
ties. It  merely  notes  their  coincidence.  By  the  same  token — and  this  is 
important — two  polyalphabetic  cryptograms  enciphered  in  the  same  key  and 
superimposed  so  that  the  two  occurrences  of  that  key  are  in  synchronization 
with  one  another  will  also  show  6.67  per  cent  of  coincidences.  The  reason  is 
this:  In  a correct  (in-phase)  superimposition, 1 #he  two  letters  of  each  vertical 
pair  have  the  same  keyletter.  Thus  whenever  a coincidence  occurs  in  the  plain- 
text, the  letters  of  the  pair  will  be  identically  enciphered.  This  results  in  an 
identical  pair— a coincidence — in  the  ciphertext.  It  does  not  matter  that  a 
pair  of  es  may  be  enciphered  into  v’s  at  one  point  and  into  q’s  at  another,  or 
that  a coincidence  of  a's  becomes  a coincidence  of  l’s  here  and  a coincidence 
of  f’s  there.  The  total  number  of  coincidences  will  remain  the  same  as  the 
number  in  the  plaintext. 

On  the  other  hand,  if  the  two  cryptograms  are  improperly  superimposed, 
so  that  the  keys  are  not  in  step,  any  coincidences  will  result  from  different 

* The  Greek  letter  kappa  is  frequently  used  in  mathematics  to  designate  a constant.

379 


keyletters  operating  on  different  plaintext  letters  to  accidentally  produce  the 
same  ciphertext  letter.  The  coincidences  will  be  caused,  in  other  words,  by 
chance.  Chance  alone  will  produce  3.85  coincidences  per  100  vertical  pairs  in 
random  text,  and  polyalphabetic  ciphertext  is  equivalent  to  random  text. 
Hence  an  incorrect  superimposition  should  yield  about  3.85  per  cent  of  coin- 
cidences. But  3.85  per  cent  is  substantially  less  than  6.67  per  cent,  and  so  a 
comparison  of  the  percentages  of  coincidences  at  various  test  superimposi- 
tions should  show  which  superimposition  is  correct. 

An  example  should  make  things  clear.  A cryptosystem  with  the  Vigenere 
running  key  THE  BARD  OF  AVON  IS  THE  AUTHOR  OF  THESE 
LINES . . . starts  the  key  for  the  first  message  with  the  first  keyletter,  but  starts 
the  key  for  successive  messages  with  the  third,  fifth,  and  so  on,  keyletters.  If 
plaintext  1 is  If  music  be  the  food  of  love,  play  on,  and  plaintext  2 is  Now  is  the 
winter  of  our  discontent,  the  encipherments  will  be  these:

A cryptanalyst,  receiving  these  two  cryptograms,  will  superimpose  them 
so  that  they  start  at  the  same  point :

ciphertext  2 rpwzvhmerwabwkv  jookkwj  qtgai  fx 

Since  there  are  28  vertical  pairs,  the  cryptanalyst  would  expect  28  x 0.0667 
coincidences  or  1.8676,  or  about  2,  for  a proper  superimposition.  But  in 
fact  he  finds  none,  so  he  shifts  the  second  cryptogram  one  space  to  the  right 
and  tries  again.  There  will  now  be  27  vertical  pairs.  The  cryptanalyst  again 
calculates  the  theoretical  expected  pumber  of  coincidences  for  random  and  for 
correctly  superimposed  texts  of  this  length  so  that  he  may  compare  the  values 
with  what  he  actually  observes.  Thus,  a wrongly  superimposed  text  would 
yield  27x0.0385  =0.9695,  or  about  1 coincidence  that  would  be  produced 
by  chance  alone,  while  a correct  superimposition  would  yield  27  x 0.0667  = 
1.2369.  (These  fractional  differences  become  more  pronounced  with  longer 
texts.)  One  coincidence  appears:

Since  the  differences  between  the  chance  and  the  caused  values  are  so  slight, 
with  so  few  letters,  the  cryptanalyst  might  wonder  whether  this  is  not  in  fact 
a random  result  (which  in  fact  it  is:  the  upper  w resulting  from  the  encipher- 
ment of  plaintext  o with  key  I,  the  lower  w resulting  from  the  encipherment

of  coincidences  immediately  jumps.  This  superimposition  is  obviously 
correct.

If  the  cryptanalyst  wishes  to  continue,  he  will  find  that  at  the  next  super- 
imposition  the  number  of  coincidences  falls  again,  to  2,  and  will  return  to 
begin  his  attack  with  the  third  superimposition. 

It  is  like  shifting,  an  inch  at  a time,  two  identical  picket  fences  with  very 
wide  pales  and  very  narrow  slits  at  irregular  locations.  From  time  to  time, 
light  will  shine  through  when  two  slits  coincide  by  chance.  But  there  will  be  a 
burst  of  radiance  when  the  fences  are  correctly  juxtaposed  and  light  can 
stream  through  all  the  slits  at  once.  Similarly  with  the  cryptograms:  the  right 
superimposition  allows  the  coincidences  that  lie  in  the  original  plaintext  to 
stand  forth,  even  though  the  polyalphabetic  key  produces  different  ciphertext 
letters  for  the  same  plaintext  letter. 

The  importance  of  the  kappa  test  in  modern  cryptology  can  hardly  be 
overestimated.  Computers  can  automatically  make  the  vertical  comparisons 
necessary  to  determine  coincidences  at  rates  of  thousands  per  second,  can 
check  the  total  against  the  two  theoretical  figures,  and  then  can  ring  a bell  to 
signalize  the  correct  superimposition  or  can  automatically  shift  the  texts  one 
place  and  try  again.  Cipher  machines  employ  keys  millions  of  letters  long  in 
attempts  to  preclude  superimposition,  but  in  heavy  traffic  several  cryptograms 
may  be  enciphered  with  overlapping  portions  of  these  keys.  Only  the  com- 
puterized kappa  test  makes  practicable  the  search  for  these  overlaps  through 
the  scores  or  hundreds  of  messages  that  are  needed  to  make  finding  them 
likely.  If  enough  are  found  to  permit  their  alignment  in  depth,  a Kerckhoffs 
attack — frequency  analysis  of  the  columns,  plus  anagramming  of  the  plain- 
text along  the  horizontal,  aided  by  symmetry  of  position  to  reconstruct  the 
cipher  alphabets — can  solve  the  cryptograms.  The  kappa  test  thus  opens  the 
door  to  the  solution  of  the  most  complex  of  modern  ciphers. 

The  parameters  kp  and  k,  animate  two  other  Greek-letter  tests,  the  phi  and 
the  chi  tests.  Both  derive  from  the  basic  principle  of  coincidence.  And  just  as 
a frequency  count  concentrates  the  spread-out  occurrences  of  individual 
letters  for  easier  assimilation,  so  the  phi  and  chi  tests  coalesce  the  separate 
tabulations  of  a frequency  count  to  make  it  easier  to  compare  counts.  These 
two  tests  were  devised  in  1935  by  one  of  Friedman’s  assistants,  Dr.  Solomon 
Kullback.  Since  Friedman’s  original  test  in  The  Index  of  Coincidence  has 
been  supplanted  by  the  chi  test,  it  seems  preferable  to  give  thelatter. 

The  phi  test,  which  is  its  basis,  can  determine  whether  a given  frequency 
count  reflects  a monalphabetic  or  a polyalphabetic  encipherment.  It  might 
be  used  to  see  whether  a Kasiski  determination  of  a period  is  correct  by  testing 
the  letters  in  the  column  for  monalphabeticity.  If  the  period  is  correct,  the 


Two  Americans

frequency  counts  of  the  columns  will  show  as  monalphabetic;  if  not,  they 
will  be  only  random. 

To  use  it,  the  cryptanalyst  first  multiplies  the  total  number  of  letters  in  the 
message  ( N ) by  that  total  less  one  ( N — 1).  He  then  multiplies  this  product  by 
Kr  to  find  what  is  known  as  the  polyalphabetic  expected  phi  (4>r).  Then  he 
performs  the  same  operation  with  kp  to  find  what  is  known  as  the  mon  - 
alphabetic  expected  phi  (cj)p).  He  sets  these  two  aside  and  goes  through  his 
frequency  count  of  the  cryptogram,  multiplying  each  letter’s  frequency  (/)  by 
that  frequency  less  one  (/—  1).  He  adds  up  these  products.  If  the  sum — the 
observed  phi — is  closer  to  the  mon  alphabetic  expected  phi  than  to  the  poly- 
alphabetic,  the  frequency  count  is  monalphabetic,  and  vice  versa.  For 
example,  with  a 26-letter  cryptogram  the  expected  phis  are: 

26x25x0.0385  = 25  for  0r 
26  x 25  x 0.0667  = 43  for  </>„ 

The  cryptogram’s  frequency  count  determines  its  observed  phi:

/x(/-l)  0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2+  0 + 0 + 0 + 0+  0 + 0 = 28 

The  observed  phi  of  28  is  noticeably  closer  to  the  polyalphabetic  expected 
phi;  the  assortment  of  letters  on  which  the  count  is  based  is  thus  probably 
polyalphabetic.  The  test  can  determine  this  fairly  accurately  for  small  distribu- 
tions, where  the  eye  cannot  discriminate  between  the  two  types  of  count. 

The  chi  test  uses  this  procedure  to  compare  two  frequency  distributions.  It 
can  tell  whether  the  letters  they  represent  have  been  enciphered  with  the 
same  key,  either  mon-  or  polyalphabetic.  For  example,  it  can  tell  whether 
two  Vigenere  cryptograms  have  the  same  keyword,  or,  more  importantly,  it 
can  pick  out  the  columns  in  a Kerckhoffs  superimposition  that  have  been 
enciphered  by  the  same  keyletter,  thus  permitting  their  letter  counts — which 
are  usually  scanty — to  be  amalgamated. 

Its  mechanics  remain  the  same  whether  a polyalphabetic  or  a mon  - 
alphabetic  distribution  is  being  tested,  the  only  difference  being  that  k r is  used 
in  the  polyalphabetic  calculations  and  xp  in  the  monalphabetic.  The  chi  test 
compares  only  two  distributions  at  a time.  The  procedure  is  this:  Multiply 
the  number  of  letters  in  one  distribution  by  the  number  in  the  other  and  by  kp 
or  xr  This  is  the  expected  chi.  Then  multiply  the  number  of  a’s  in  one  by  the 
number  of  a’s  in  the  other,  the  number  of  b' s by  the  number  of  b’ s,  and  so  on. 
Total  these  products.  The  sum  constitutes  the  observed  chi.  If  the  observed 
chi  is  reasonably  close  to  the  expected,  the  distributions  represent  identically 
enciphered  assortments  of  letters.

The  only  expected  and  observed  chis  that  agree  to  any  extent  are  those  for 
counts  2 and  3;  their  messages  may  then  be  regarded  as  having  identical 
encipherments  and  may  be  combined  in  all  respects,  making  identification  of 
plaintext  letters  that  much  easier.  With  Kerckhoffs  superimpositions  in 
which  the  columns  run  only  10  or  15  letters  deep,  the  chi  test  in  effect  makes 
solution  practicable. 

The  same  procedure  may  be  used  to  correctly  line  up  frequency  distribu- 
tions that  have  been  shifted  relative  to  one  another — a task  almost  impossible 
to  do  by  eye  when  the  counts  are  small.  For  example,  a cryptanalyst  knows 
that  two  frequency  counts  represent  the  same  cipher  alphabet  but  standing  at 
different  positions  relative  to  the  normal  alphabet.  He  can  run  the  chi  test  at 
each  of  the  26  possible  juxtapositions  of  the  two  to  see  at  which  point  they 
represent  identical  encipherments.  If  the  cryptanalyst  can  determine  this,  he 
will  know  the  distance  that  one  has  to  be  slid  to  match  the  other  and  so  their 
relative  displacement.  This  knowledge  plays  an  essential  role  in  the  other 
technique  that  Friedman  described  in  The  Index  of  Coincidence. 

One  of  the  two  ciphers  that  he  was  analyzing  in  that  publication  was  a 
progressive-alphabet  system.  For  simplicity’s  sake,  this  may  be  imagined  as  a 
St.-Cyr  slide  with  a mixed  cipher  alphabet  that  shifts  forward  one  space  after 
each  plaintext  letter  is  enciphered.  The  period  is  26,  and  a cryptanalyst  would 
have  no  trouble  in  distributing  the  letters  of  a cryptogram  into  26  columns,

each  enciphered  at  a setting  of  the  slide.  If  the  cryptanalyst  focuses  on  one 
letter  of  the  ciphertext  alphabet  as  it  creeps  forward  with  the  slide,  he  will  see 
that  this  letter  adopts  at  any  given  position  the  frequency  of  the  plaintext 
letter  above  it.  It  exists  with  that  frequency  in  the  column  representing  that 
setting  of  the  slide,  and  “deposits”  this  frequency  in  a frequency  count  for 
that  column.  At  the  next  setting  of  the  slide,  it  attires  itself  in  the  frequency  of 
the  plaintext  letter  above  it  at  this  point,  and  again  sheds  the  frequency  of 
that  plaintext  letter  in  a frequency  count  for  the  column  representing  that 
setting.  The  cryptanalyst  now  looks  at  his  26  frequency  counts,  which  repre- 
sent the  successive  positions  of  the  slide  as  the  key  progressed.  He  singles 
out  this  one  letter  in  the  successive  counts.  Its  differing  frequencies  mark  the 
differing  plaintext  letters  it  has  represented  as  it  has  moved  along.  The  point 
to  see  is  that  these  successive  frequencies  reflect  the  plaintext  letters  in  their 
order  in  the  plaintext  alphabet.  If  this  order  happens  to  be  the  normal 
alphabet,  things  will  be  simplified,  but  the  order  itself  is  immaterial  to  what 
follows. 

While  this  cipher  letter  is  creating  this  pattern  of  frequencies,  another 
cipher  letter  is  also  creating  it.  As  this  other  cipher  letter  moves  past  the 
letters  of  the  plaintext  alphabet,  it  too  is  piling  up  little  mounds  of  frequencies 
in  the  successive  column  counts.  These  mounds  likewise  mirror  the  order  of 
the  letters  in  the  plaintext  alphabet.  The  two  patterns  will  be  virtually 
identical,  differing  only  by  the  usual  and  slight  variations  in  plaintext.  Now 
if  one  letter  precedes  another  on  the  ciphertext  slide  by,  say,  three  places,  its 
pattern,  as  seen  cutting  through  the  26  frequency  counts,  will  obviously  be 
shifted  three  places  forward  of  the  pattern  of  the  other  letter.  So  if  the 
cryptanalyst  can  determine  the  displacements  of  the  patterns  with  respect 
to  one  another,  he  can  find  the  relative  positions  of  those  two  ciphertext 
letters  in  the  ciphertext  alphabet.  By  determining  the  relative  displacement  of 
all  the  ciphertext  letters  in  this  fashion,  the  cryptanalyst  can  reconstruct  the 
entire  ciphertext  alphabet!  And  he  can  do  it  without  guessing  at  a single 
plaintext  letter! 

Friedman  developed  the  ancestor  of  the  chi  test  to  compare  the  frequency 
patterns  to  determine  the  displacements.  This  comparison  is  a crafty  and 
ingenious  idea,  with  many  applications  in  the  cryptanalyses  of  complex 
systems,  especially  machines  using  cryptographic  rotors,  which  are  progres- 
sive. But  it  has  had  nowhere  near  the  impact  of  the  statistical  concept. 
Friedman  presented  both  ideas  in  The  Index  of  Coincidence,  and  cryptology 
has  never  been  the  same  since. 

Before  Friedman,  cryptology  eked  out  an  existence  as  a study  unto  itself, 
as  an  isolated  phenomenon,  neither  borrowing  from  nor  contributing  to 
other  bodies  of  knowledge.  Frequency  counts,  linguistic  characteristics, 
Kasiski  examinations — all  were  peculiar  and  particular  to  cryptology.  It 
dwelt  a recluse  in  the  world  of  science.  Friedman  led  cryptology  out  of  this 
lonely  wilderness  and  into  the  broad  rich  domain  of  statistics.  He  connected 


384 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


cryptology  to  mathematics.  The  sense  of  expanding  horizons  must  have 
resembled  that  felt  by  chemists  when  Friedrich  Wohler  synthesized  urea, 
demonstrating  that  life  processes  operate  under  well-known  chemical  laws 
and  are  therefore  subject  to  experimentation  and  control,  and  leading  to  to- 
day’s vast  strides  in  biochemistry.  When  Friedman  subsumed  cryptanalysis 
under  statistics,  he  likewise  flung  wide  the  door  to  an  armamentarium  to 
which  cryptology  had  never  before  had  access.  Its  weapons — measures  of 
central  tendency  and  dispersion,  of  fit  and  skewness,  of  probability  and 
sampling  and  significance — were  ideally  fashioned  to  deal  with  the  statistical 
behavior  of  letters  and  words.  Cryptanalysts,  seizing  them  with  alacrity,  have 
wielded  them  with  notable  success  ever  since. 

This  is  why  Friedman  has  said,  in  looking  back  over  his  career,  that  The 
Index  of  Coincidence  was  his  greatest  single  creation.  It  alone  would  have  won 
him  his  reputation.  But  in  fact  it  was  only  the  beginning. 

He  and  Mrs.  Friedman  quit  Riverbank  near  the  end  of  1920.  The  situation 
had  become  intolerable.  Fabyan  had  lured  him  back  after  the  war  with  raises 
and  promises  of  absolute  freedom  to  prove  or  disprove  the  existence  of 
ciphers  in  Shakespeare.  But  he  had  squelched  every  attempt  to  do  so  and  had 
embarrassed  Friedman  into  apparently  acquiescent  silence  at  lantern-slide 
lectures  on  the  subject.  On  January  1,  1921,  Friedman  began  a six-month 
contract  with  the  Signal  Corps  to  devise  cryptosystems.  When  it  expired,  he 
was  taken  on  the  civil-service  payroll  of  the  War  Department  at  $4,500  a year. 

One  of  his  first  assignments  was  to  teach  a course  in  military  codes  and 
ciphers  at  the  Signal  School,  then  at  Camp  Alfred  Vail,  New  Jersey.  For  this 
he  wrote  a textbook  that,  for  the  first  time,  imposed  order  upon  the  chaos  of 
cipher  systems  and  their  terminology.  These  had  sprouted  in  a bewildering 
variety,  and  writers  treated  them  individually,  with  little  comprehension  of 
the  close  connection  between,  say,  the  Vigenere  and  the  Gronsfeld.  Friedman 
sorted  them  out  on  the  basis  of  structure  instead  of  aspect,  and  so  logical  and 
useful  was  this  classification  that  it  has  become  standard.  He  modeled  his 
nomenclature  on  his  categories,  so  that  the  names  he  minted  have  the  great 
merit  of  making  the  relations  between  the  various  genera  of  ciphers  evident 
on  sight.  An  example  is  the  complementary  pair  “monalphabet”  and 
“polyalphabet”;  Givierge  was  even  then  calling  polyalphabetic  systems  by  the 
almost  obfuscatory  “double  substitution,”  which  tells  absolutely  nothing  at 
all  about  the  system.  Friedman’s  most  important  coinage  was  the  word 
“cryptanalysis,”  which  he  devised  in  1920  to  clear  up  a chronic  source  of 
confusion  in  cryptology — the  ambiguity  of  the  verb  “decipher,”  then  used  to 
mean  both  authorized  and  unauthorized  reductions  of  a cryptogram  to  plain- 
text. He  titled  his  book  Elements  of  Cryptanalysis,  and  the  term  has  so  pros- 
pered that  today  it  circulates  in  general  conversation  and  print. 

While  the  book’s  main  contribution  is  its  taxonomy,  each  of  its  143  pages 
of  text  manifests  the  author’s  concern  for  always  making  clear  to  the  reader

why  things  happen  as  they  do.  As  a result,  the  student  understands  principles 
and  phenomena,  and  the  lessons  stick.  Partly  because  of  this  pedagogical 
effectiveness,  partly  because  of  its  substantive  values,  Friedman’s  book, 
issued  by  the  Chief  Signal  Officer  in  May  of  1923  as  Training  Pamphlet  No.  3, 
has  guided  the  development  of  all  American  cryptology  since  then. 

At  the  start  of  1922,  Friedman  became  Chief  Cryptanalyst  of  the  Signal 
Corps  in  charge  of  the  Code  and  Cipher  Compilation  Section,  Research  and 
Development  Division,  Office  of  the  Chief  Signal  Officer.  To  help  him  carry 
on  the  work  of  the  office  he  had  a single  clerk-typist — a cauliflower-eared  ex- 
prizefighter. Because  Yardley’s  Black  Chamber  was  doing  the  cryptanalysis 
for  the  War  Department,  Friedman’s  functions  were  nominally  cryptographic. 
He  installed  the  m-94,  or  Jefferson-Bazeries  cylinder,  as  the  Army’s  field 
cipher.  Paradoxically,  however,  his  job  involved  a great  deal  of  cryptanalysis. 
He  was  continually  testing  the  new  systems  of  cryptography  urged  on  the 
Army  as  “absolutely  indecipherable”  by  zealous  amateurs. 

Most  difficult  of  these  was  the  machine  with  five  wired  codewheels — 
rotors — invented  by  Edward  H.  Hebern,  whose  principle  is  today  the  most 
widely  used  in  high-level  cryptography.  Each  of  the  rotors  generates  a 
progressive  cipher,  and  in  1925  Friedman  devised  the  kappa  test  and  extended 
his  Index  of  Coincidence  analyses  to  determine  the  order  and  starting  positions 
of  the  rotors.  The  five  progressive  ciphers  intertwine  in  a cipher  of  hideous 
nightmare  complexity,  but  in  a later  solution  Friedman  sorted  them  out  and 
reconstructed  the  wiring  of  the  rotors.  This  work  was  of  the  utmost  import- 
ance, for  it  laid  the  foundations  for  the  purple  machine  solution  and  for 
today’s  many  solutions  of  modern  rotor  machines.  The  technique  was  far  in 
advance  of  its  time.  So  far  as  is  known,  not  another  cryptanalyst  on  the  globe 
could  duplicate  it — and  none  did,  apparently,  for  more  than  two  decades. 
With  this  solution  of  Friedman’s,  world  leadership  in  cryptology  passed  to 
America. 

Friedman’s  horizons  were  continually  expanding.  In  1922,  he  had  filed 
applications  for  his  first  two  patents — improvements  on  a device  recently 
invented  by  Gilbert  S.  Vernam.  In  1924,  he  testified  before  a Congressional 
committee  to  his  reading  of  some  messages  in  the  Teapot  Dome  scandal. 
When  Mars  made  an  extremely  close  approach  to  Earth  a few  months  later, 
he  joined  in  the  Roaring  Twenties  wackiness  by  standing  by  to  translate  any 
revelations  the  Martians  may  have  condescended  to  pass  along.  He  had 
returned  to  mundane  problems  by  1927,  when  he  wrote  a history  and  theory 
of  commercial  codes  for  the  American  delegations  to  international  communi- 
cations conferences,  which  were  then  heatedly  discussing  the  pronounceability 
of  codewords  as  a basis  for  cable  toll  rates.  The  following  year,  he  served  as 
secretary  and  technical  advisor  to  the  American  delegation  to  the  Inter- 
national Telegraph  Conference  of  Brussels.  In  1929,  he  became  widely  known 
as  one  of  the  world’s  leading  authorities  on  cryptology  when  the  Encyclo- 
paedia Britannica  published  his  article  on  “Codes  and  Ciphers.”

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Meanwhile,  the  Army  had  been  studying  its  divided  cryptologic  operation 
and,  shortly  before  the  State  Department  withdrew  support  from  Yardley’s 
bureau,  had  decided  to  integrate  both  cryptographic  and  cryptanalytic  func- 
tions in  the  Signal  Corps.  The  closing  of  the  Black  Chamber  eased  the  transi- 
tion, and  on  May  10,  1929,  cryptologic  responsibility  devolved  upon  the  Chief 
Signal  Officer.  To  better  meet  these  new  responsibilities,  the  Signal  Corps 
established  a Signal  Intelligence  Service  in  its  War  Plans  and  Training 
Division,  with  Friedman  as  director.  Its  officially  stated  mission  was  to 
prepare  the  Army’s  codes  and  ciphers,  to  intercept  and  solve  enemy  com- 
munications in  war,  and  in  peace  to  do  the  training  and  research — a vague 
enough  term — necessary  to  become  immediately  operational  at  the  outbreak 
of  war.  To  carry  out  these  duties,  Friedman  hired  three  junior  cryptanalysts, 
all  in  their  early  twenties,  at  $2,000  a year — the  first  of  the  second  generation 
of  American  cryptologists.  They  were  Frank  Rowlett,  a Virginian,  and 
Solomon  Kullback  and  Abraham  Sinkov,  close  college  friends  who  had 
taught  together  in  New  York  City  high  schools  before  coming  to  Washington 
and  who  both  received  their  Ph.D.’s  in  mathematics  a few  years  later.  It  was 
the  beginning  of  an  expansion  that  led  to  the  massive  cryptologic  organization 
of  today. 

By  this  time  the  Navy,  too,  had  its  cryptologic  section.  Like  the  Army’s,  it 
had  evolved  gradually. 

When  the  Navy  was  reorganized  during  World  War  I in  its  present  form, 
with  a Chief  of  Naval  Operations,  responsibility  for  cryptography  was  trans- 
ferred in  October  1917  from  the  Bureau  of  Navigation,  which  had  long  held 
it,  to  the  new  Office  of  Naval  Communications.  The  four  young  assistant 
communication  officers — who  were  burdened  by  the  unfortunate  Navy 
jargon-abbreviation  “asscoms” — coded  and  decoded  messages  in  their 
office  in  the  old  State-War-Navy  departments  building,  where  Yardley  also 
worked.  They  were  doing  this  work  even  before  the  transfer.  When  an  inquiry 
was  held  on  the  loss  of  a battle  signal  book,  letters  flooded  in  from  amateurs 
all  over  the  country  who  thought  they  had  the  answer  to  the  Navy’s  code 
security.  It  fell  to  the  senior  assistant  communication  officer,  Lieutenant 
(j.g.)  W.  W.  (Poco)  Smith,  to  reply.  He  picked  up  the  gauntlet  thrown  down 
in  the  form  of  challenge  messages,  and  solved  them,  learning  a great  deal  about 
cryptology  in  the  process. 

In  1916,  the  Navy  had  three  main  codes:  the  old,  ponderous,  seldom-used 
Secret  Code  of  1887,  the  five-letter  sigcode,  which  could  be  used  only  by 
officers  and  which  had  a variety  of  ciphers,  some  for  flag  officers,  some  for  all 
Navy  ships,  and  the  four-letter  radio  code  that  was  only  confidential  and  that 
could  be  worked  by  enlisted  men.  But  at  the  time  of  the  Marine  landing  in 
Haiti,  a State  Department  message  was  transmitted  there  in  the  sigcode; 
the  plaintext  was  published;  the  code  was  assumed  compromised,  and  Smith 
was  designated  to  prepare  a new  one.

“It  was,”  he  recalled,  “a  colossal  job.  First,  1 simplified  but  expanded  the 
context.  . . . Now,  a more  difficult  problem:  five-letter  code  groups  and  the 
text  were  both  arranged  alphabetically.  This  would  not  do.  Exhausting  the  pos- 
sibilities of  arranging  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  into  mixed  groups  of  five 
letters  each,*  I typed  these  in  columns,  scissored  them,  and  dropped  them 
into  a bucket.  After  mixing,  I drew  the  groups  one  at  a time  and  typed  them 
in  double-spaced  columns  to  be  placed  opposite  the  text  words  or  phrases  to 
be  encoded.  Tedious  work.”  Also  crude  and  time-consuming.  Naval  Code 
A-l  was  not  completed  and  printed  by  the  Government  Printing  Office  until 
after  the  United  States  had  entered  World  War  I. 

While  Smith  was  making  up  the  code,  the  Navy  set  up  a Code  and  Signal 
Section  in  naval  communications  to  handle  the  cryptographic  duties.  In 
charge  was  Lieutenant  Russell  Willson,  who  devised  a strip  form  of  the 
Jefferson  cylinder  with  fixed  indices  as  a superencipherment  system.  The 
metal  frame  and  strips  on  which  the  mixed  alphabets  were  stamped  were 
manufactured  at  the  Naval  Gun  Factory  in  southeast  Washington,  and  the 
device,  called  the  “ncb”  (for  “Navy  Code  Box”),  was  used  from  1917  on. 
(Congress  awarded  Willson  $15,000  in  1935  for  the  Navy’s  use  of  the  device, 
which  was  then  still  in  service.)  Meanwhile,  Smith,  who  wanted  to  remain  a 
line  officer  for  future  command  and  not  become  a deskbound  specialist, 
sailed  off  to  war  in  January,  1918,  vowing  never  to  return  to  communications 
duty — which  he  never  did.  An  experience  like  his  in  code-construction  would 
have  conditioned  anybody  against  cryptology.  (He  did,  however,  write  one 
of  the  classic  expositions  of  the  solution  of  the  Playfair  cipher,  which  appeared 
in  J.  C.  H.  Macbeth’s  translation  of  Andre  Langie’s  De  la  cryptographic.) 

Naval  participation  in  the  war  was  too  limited  for  much  cryptanalytic 
development,  but  interest  was  stimulated.  Accordingly,  in  January  of  1924, 
Lieutenant  Laurance  F.  Safford  was  ordered  to  set  up  a radio  intelligence 
organization  in  the  Code  and  Signal  Section.  When  he  left  for  sea  duty  two 
years  later,  a small,  highly  secret  organization  was  functioning  in  Room  2646 
of  the  “temporary”  Navy  Department  building  on  Constitution  Avenue. 
Lieutenant  Ellis  M.  Zacharias,  who  trained  seven  months  in  1926  with  the 
cryptanalytic  organization,  told  what  it  was  like: 

My  days  were  spent  in  study  and  work  among  people  with  whom  security  had 
become  second  nature.  Hours  went  by  without  any  of  us  saying  a word,  just 
sitting  in  front  of  piles  of  indexed  sheets  on  which  a mumbo  jumbo  of  figures  or 
letters  was  displayed  in  chaotic  disorder,  trying  to  solve  the  puzzle  bit  by  bit  like 
fitting  together  the  pieces  of  a jigsaw  puzzle.  We  were  just  a few  then  in  Room 
2646,  young  people  who  gave  ourselves  to  cryptography  with  the  same  ascetic 
devotion  with  which  young  men  enter  a monastery.  It  was  known  to  everyone 
that  the  secrecy  of  our  work  would  prevent  the  ordinary  recognition  accorded 

* Poetic  license.  There  are  actually  11,881,376  permutations  of  the  26  letters  in  groups 
of  five,  far  more  than  any  code  has  ever  used. 


388  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

to  other  accomplishments.  It  was  then  that  I first  learned  that  intelligence  work, 

like  virtue,  is  its  own  reward. 

On  completion  of  his  apprenticeship,  Zacharias  took  charge  of  an  intercept 
post  on  the  fourth  floor  of  the  American  consulate  in  Shanghai  to  learn  as 
much  as  he  could  from  Japanese  naval  messages.  Salford  returned  to  crypto- 
logy in  June,  1929,  and,  except  for  a four-year  tour  at  sea  from  1932  to  1936, 
stayed  with  the  science  from  then  on.  He  built  up  the  communications  intel- 
ligence organization  into  what  later  became  op-20-g  and,  by  adding  improve- 
ments of  his  own  to  Edward  Hebern’s  rotor  mechanisms,  gradually  developed 
cipher  machines  suitable  for  the  Navy’s  requirements  of  speed,  reliability,  and 
security.  His  contributions  to  cryptanalytics  were  minor,  since  his  talents  lay 
more  in  the  administrative  and  mechanical  fields.  But  he  is  the  father  of  the 
Navy’s  present  cryptologic  organization. 

In  the  Munitions  Building  next  door  to  the  Navy  Department,  Friedman 
had  begun  tutoring  his  junior  cryptanalysts,  who  had  not  the  feeblest  know- 
ledge of  codes  and  ciphers,  in  these  arcane  mysteries.  They  discovered  an 
aptitude  for  them.  In  November,  1931,  they  and  Friedman  solved  in  a few 
hours  a teletypewriter  cipher  machine  offered  for  sale  to  the  State  Depart- 
ment by  its  inventor,  Parker  Hitt,  then  of  International  Telephone  and 
Telegraph.  In  1934  they  prepared  a paper  on  a general  solution  for  the  adfgvx, 
and  in  1935  Kullback  devised  the  phi  and  chi  tests,  publishing  them  in  an 
important  monograph  entitled  Statistical  Methods  in  Cryptanalysis.  Friedman 
wrote  Elementary  Military  Cryptography,  Advanced  Military  Cryptography, 
and  Military  Cryptanalysis,  the  latter  an  expansion  of  his  Elements  of  Crypt- 
analysis, as  texts  for  Army  extension  courses.  Military  Cryptanalysis,  which 
appeared  in  four  parts,  comprises  the  finest,  most  lucid  exposition  of  the 
solution  o£> basic  ciphers  that  has  ever  been  published. 

Gradually,  despite  depression  and  isolationism,  the  Signal  Intelligence 
Service  expanded.  In  July  of  1934,  First  Fieutenant  W.  Preston  (Red) 
Corderman,  who  had  studied  in  what  was  rather  grandly  known  as  the  S.I.S. 
School  (the  faculty  consisted  of  Friedman  and  his  assistants),  became  an 
instructor  in  that  school  when  it  was  formally  constituted  as  a separate 
section.  In  August  of  1935,  Major  Haskell  Allison  replaced  Friedman  as 
administrative  head  of  S.I.S.,  though  Friedman  continued  to  direct  the 
cryptologic  activities.  Its  first  sizable  expansion  came  in  the  fiscal  year  1938, 
when  the  number  of  civilian  employees  (clerks  included)  was  raised  from  six 
to  eleven  on  a personnel  budget  of  $24,360. 

During  these  years,  Friedman  further  expanded  his  interests.  He  discussed 
the  cryptologic  abilities  of  Edgar  Allan  Poe  and  Jules  Verne  in  scholarly 
articles,  solved  ciphers  posed  as  challenges  by  earlier  writers  on  cryptology, 
investigated  historical  problems  such  as  the  Zimmermann  telegram  and  the 
field  codes  of  the  A.E.F.  He  got  important  works  translated,  and  annotated 


Two  Americans 


389 


them  with  his  ubiquitous  “W.F.F.”  He  continued  to  patent  inventions. 
Unfortunately,  caught  between  the  need  for  secrecy  and  a desire  for  fame,  he 
tended  to  play  the  dog  in  the  cryptologic  manger — if  he  couldn’t  have  the 
glory,  no  one  else  would.  His  usual  tactic  was  to  blacken  amateur  contribu- 
tions, often  quite  worthwhile,  as  “unprofessional.”  His  wife,  who  had  solved 
the  codes  of  rumrunners  during  Prohibition,  continued  her  cryptanalytical 
activities  for  the  Treasury  Department.  They  even  managed  to  raise  two 
children,  Barbara  and  John  Ramsay. 

In  the  late  1930s,  as  the  crisis  of  war  drew  near,  the  Army  accelerated  its 
plans  for  mobilization.  Of  the  entire  War  Department  establishment,  the 
S.I.S.  was  the  first  to  be  augmented  in  personnel,  space,  and  facilities.  On 
November  2, 1939,  authorization  was  obtained  for  26  more  civilian  employees. 
Selected  civilians,  enlisted  men,  and  Navy  reserve  officers  were  allowed  to  take 
the  extension  courses  previously  given  only  to  Army  reserve  officers;  by  June 
30,  1939,  a total  of  283  students  were  enrolled.  A few  members  of  the  Ameri- 
can Cryptogram  Association  were  recruited.  The  six  Signal  Service  Companies 
in  the  field  that  had  supplied  intercepts  to  S.I.S.  were  centralized  on  January 
1,  1939,  in  a 2nd  Signal  Service  Company,  with  an  authorized  strength  of  101 
enlisted  men. 

The  driving  force  behind  this  expansion  was  the  Chief  Signal  Officer,  that 
one-time  cryptologist,  Joseph  O.  Mauborgne,  now  a two-star  general.  As  one 
of  the  first  steps  in  the  upgrading  of  S.I.S.,  he  had  established  it  on  April  23, 
1938,  as  an  independent  section  in  his  office.  It  was  he  who  directed  it  to  bend 
its  energies  to  the  solution  of  the  Japanese  purple  system  and,  as  an  old  and 
close  friend  of  Friedman,  urged  him  to  lead  the  assault.  Friedman  did — and 
wth  that  bright  genius  of  a dark  science  blazing  the  way,  the  S.I.S.  team 
struggled  upward  in  one  of  the  most  arduous,  grinding,  extended,  and 
ultimately  triumphant  cryptanalyses  in  history.  The  date  was  August,  1940; 
Friedman  was  48.  With  the  conquest  of  this  Everest,  the  greatest  career  in 
cryptology  reached  its  climax.  A few  months  later,  the  captain  of  the  team 
succumbed  to  the  strain  of  the  solution.  He  was  admitted  to  Walter  Reed 
General  Hospital  on  January  4,  1941,  for  a nervous  breakdown  and  was 
discharged  March  24.  He  had  to  retire,  with  a permanent  disability,  from  his 
lieutenant  colonelcy  in  the  Signal  Corps  reserve. 

Afterward,  his  superiors  refused  to  allow  him  to  work  more  than  a few 
hours  a day,  and  then  only  in  the  less  taxing  area  of  communications  security. 
Though  he  was  still  Chief  Cryptanalyst  of  the  War  Department/he  served  as 
Director  of  Communications  Research  for  the  S.I.S.  (under  its  various  names, 
chiefly  Signal  Security  Agency)  throughout  World  War  II.  The  post  was 
a high  one;  military  reviews  were  held  for  him  when  he  visited  intercept 
stations  or  other  cryptologic  posts.  He  spent  most  of  the  war  at  the 
Arlington  Hall  Station,  located  in  suburban  Virginia  in  what  had  been' 
a girls’  school.  Not  a few  of  the  thousands  who  worked  there  remember 
with  gratitude  the  natty,  mustachioed  man  with  the  bow  tie  who  picked 


390  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

them  up  as  they  stood  shivering  at  the  bus  stop  and  gave  them  a lift  into 
Washington. 

Friedman  retained  his  directorship  when  the  agency  was  divorced  from  the 
Signal  Corps  on  September  15,  1945,  and  placed  under  g-2  as  the  Army 
Security  Agency.  Upon  the  creation  of  the  Armed  Forces  Security  Agency  in 
1949,  he  became  chief  of  the  technical  division.  When  this  agency  was  sup- 
planted in  1952  by  the  National  Security  Agency,  which  handles  most  of  the 
cryptologic  activities  of  the  United  States,  Friedman  became  chief  technical 
consultant,  and  two  years  later,  special  assistant  to  the  director.  Fie  had  also 
been,  since  1947,  the  Cryptologist  of  the  Department  of  Defense. 

He  retired  in  1955,  relinquishing  all  these  posts  but  remaining  as  a con- 
sultant. In  1944,  he  received  the  Commendation  for  Exceptional  Civilian 
Service,  the  War  Department’s  highest  civilian  decoration,  and,  in  1946, 
President  Truman  conferred  upon  him  the  Medal  for  Merit,  the  highest 
award  for  civilian  service  that  the  United  States  government  can  give.  The 
citations  were  necessarily  vague,  referring  only  (in  the  case  of  the  Medal  for 
Merit)  to  “exceptionally  meritorious  conduct  in  the  performance  of  out- 
standing service,  conspicuously  above  the  usual.”  On  October  12,  1955,  at  a 
ceremony  before  500  people  honoring  his  retirement,  Allen  W.  Dulles,  the 
Director  of  Central  Intelligence,  unexpectedly  pinned  the  National  Security 
Medal  on  Friedman’s  breast.  A picture  snapped  just  after  the  presentation 
shows  Friedman  standing  overwhelmed  with  surprise,  apparently  fighting 
back  tears,  as  Dulles,  Sinkov,  Kullback,  and  Major  General  Ralph  J.  Canine, 
director  of  N.S.A.,  applaud.  The  medal,  the  highest  decoration  for  distin- 
guished achievement  relating  to  the  national  intelligence  effort,  was  the  sixth 
to  be  awarded  since  its  creation  in  1953. 

As  the  pressure  of  his  duties  declined,  Friedman  and  his  wife  returned  to 
the  cryptologic  field  that  had  gotten  them  started — the  Baconian  ciphers.  They 
summed  up  the  experience  of  a lifetime  in  a long  and  exhaustive  report  that 
won  them  the  Folger  Shakespeare  Library  literary  prize  in  1955.  After  his 
retirement,  they  collaborated  in  preparing  this  work  for  1957  publication  by 
the  Cambridge  University  Press  as  The  Shakespearean  Ciphers  Examined. 
While,  as  The  New  York  Times  Book  Review  accurately  said,  they  buried 
“these  pseudocryptograms  beneath  a mass  of  evidence  as  crushing  as  an 
avalanche,”  they  also  introduced  their  readers  to  a rogues’  gallery  of  pseudo- 
cryptologists  not  to  be  met  elsewhere  in  literature. The  Friedmans  here  display 
a rather  surprising — surprising  to  one  who  has  perused  only  his  technical 
writing — wit  and  talent  for  personality  sketches. 

In  1956,  the  84th  Congress  voted  to  pay  Friedman  $100,000  in  compensa- 
tion for  profits  he  had  been  unable  to  realize  because  security  prevented  him 
from  marketing  cipher  machines  that  he  had  invented  for  the  government.  It 
marked  the  successful  end  of  a battle  that  had  begun  six  years  earlier  when  his 
lawyers  decided  that  under  existing  law  he  could  not  sue  to  recover  his  losses 
and  that  he  must  seek  legislative  relief.  “The  immeasurable  stress  of  his

work,”  they  stated  in  a memorandum  asking  the  Defense  Department  not  to 
oppose  the  measure,  “and  the  burden  of  responsibility  imposed  by  the  neces- 
sity for  constant  secrecy  ever  since  1921  were  major  factors  in  the  impairment 
of  Mr.  Friedman’s  health  which  now  makes  his  livelihood  increasingly 
precarious.  It  is  this  last  consideration  which  finally  induced  Mr.  Friedman 
to  permit  us  to  bring  the  matter  to  the  attention  of  the  Department  of 
Defense.” 

Involved  were  nine  inventions  made  from  1933  to  1944,  two  with  Rowlett’s 
aid,  though  the  bill  was  not  limited  to  them.  Two  were  so  secret  that  no  patent 
applications  had  ever  been  filed.  Four  are  held  in  secrecy  in  the  Patent  Office: 
three  of  these  pertained  to  the  Converter  m-134-c,  a rotor  machine,  and  one 
to  the  Converter  m-228.  Three  have  issued  as  patents:  a strip  form  of  the 
Jefferson  cylinder;  the  Converter  m-325,  another  rotor  machine;  and  a 
facsimile  enciphering  system. 

“Procurement  by  the  United  States  of  devices  constructed  in  accordance 
with  the  principles  of  Mr.  Friedman’s  inventions  has  approximated  $10 
million,”  the  Secretary  of  the  Army  wrote  to  Congress  in  support  of  Fried- 
man’s case  in  1953,  “most  of  which  occurred  during  the  active  phase  of 
World  War  II,  and  has  involved  the  use  of  substantially  all  his  inventions.  . . . 
Under  the  circumstances  of  his  employment,  it  appears  that  the  Government 
has  at  least  a nonexclusive  license  in  Mr.  Friedman’s  inventions,  Mr.  Fried- 
man retaining  the  right  to  otherwise  exploit  them.  Because  of  security  con- 
siderations, however,  Mr.  Friedman  has  been  prevented  from  attempting  to 
derive  any  gain  from  his  inventions  commercially  or  from  foreign  govern- 
ments.” 

The  legal  question  was  fearfully  confused,  but  the  Secretary,  Robert  T. 
Stevens  of  Army-McCarthy-hearings  fame,  felt  that  Friedman  deserved 
equitable  redress — in  the  sum,  however,  of  only  $25,000.  The  following  year, 
he  changed  his  mind  and  agreed  that  $100,000  “would  not  constitute  more 
than  adequate  compensation.”  This  followed  a reappraisal  by  N.S.A. 
Director  General  Canine,  who  observed  that  a large  market  existed  among 
foreign  governments  for  cipher  machines  and  that  the  excellence  of  Fried- 
man’s inventions  would  have  given  him  an  important  competitive  advantage. 
The  Bureau  of  the  Budget  questioned  the  award  on  the  ground  that  it  was 
inconsistent  with  government  policy  on  secret  inventions  made  by  federal 
employees.  It  also  put  its  finger  on  what  appeared  to  be  one  of  the  chief 
motives  for  the  award:  Friedman’s  outstanding  achievements.  His  lawyers 
were  always  careful  to  found  their  claims  on  the  alleged  financial  loss — but 
they  never  failed  to  cite  Friedman’s  record. 

Two  bills  for  Friedman’s  relief  had  died  in  committee  during  these  pro- 
longed negotiations.  Finally,  a hearing  was  held  on  the  third  bill  before  the 
Senate  subcommittee  on  patents,  trademarks,  and  copyrights.  It  was  brief, 
mainly  because  Senator  Joseph  C.  O’Mahoney,  who  was  presiding,  was  in  a 
great  hurry  to  get  to  the  Senate  floor.  The  witnesses — notably  Friedman  s

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


attorney  and  the  lawyer  for  Swedish  cipher-machine  manufacturer  Boris  C. 
W.  Hagelin,  who  had  become  a millionaire  when  Friedman  had  ordered  his 
machines  for  the  U.S.  Army  in  World  War  II — discoursed  eloquently  on  the 
glowing  opportunities  of  commercial  cryptography.  The  subcommittee 
approved  the  bill;  Congress  passed  it;  President  Eisenhower  signed  it  on 
May  10,  1956,  and  Friedman  got  his  $100,000. 

It  must  be  stated  that  justice  was  not  served  thereby.  In  the  case  of  the 
seven  inventions  that  were  filed  in  the  patent  office,  at  least  five  were  deriva- 
tive— mere  improvements  upon  the  basic  creations  of  others.  Such  were  the 
rotor  machines,  compensation  for  which  should  have  gone  to  the  estate  of 
Edward  Hebern,  and  the  strip  device,  recompense  for  which  should  have  been 
paid  either  to  Jefferson’s  estate  or  to  Parker  Hitt,  who  first  conceived  the 
principle  in  strip  form.  (The  other  two  were  quite  probably  derivative  as 
well.)  Hebern’s  lawyer,  in  fact,  tried  to  make  this  point  at  the  hearing,  but 
O’Mahoney  cut  him  short.  The  Friedman  award  more  rightfully  belonged  to 
others;  it  went  to  him  because  of  well-situated  friends,  picayune  mechanical 
differences,  and  a great  but  totally  irrelevant  record.* 

This  blot  dims  but  little  the  luster  of  Friedman’s  escutcheon.  He  has 
ranged  over  more  cryptologic  territory  than  anyone  else,  and  has  mined  it 
more  deeply.  Some  of  this  was  due  to  the  accident  of  time  and  circumstance, 
which  were  more  propitious  for  cryptology  then  than  before  or  since.  The  era 
of  radio  had  opened;  mechanization  had  begun  to  transform  cryptography; 
armies  were  becoming  more  mobile  and  larger  and  increasingly  dependent 
upon  control  by  communications;  the  United  States  had  emerged  as  a major 
power,  and  politics  were  global.  These  currents  gathered  momentum,  cul- 
minating in  the  Second  World  War;  after  a brief  respite,  the  cold  war  renewed 
them.  Friedman  was  lucky  enough  to  come  to  maturity  as  this  surge  was 
swelling,  and  smart  enough  to  see  and  seize  the  opportunity  it  presented.  Yet 
environment  alone  does  not  explain  the  magnitude  of  his  achievements;  none

SECRECY  FOR  SALE 


on  a morning  in  December  of  1917,  a rather  handsome  young  man  of  27 
hurried  through  the  colonnaded  lobby  of  the  American  Telephone  & Tele- 
graph Company  at  195  Broadway  in  downtown  Manhattan.  He  rode  the 
elevator  up  to  the  17th  floor,  where  he  worked  in  the  telegraph  section  of  the 
company’s  development  and  research  department.  This  section,  composed  of 
some  of  the  brightest  engineers  in  the  company,  was  concentrating  on  the 
newest  development  in  telegraphy,  the  printing  telegraph  or  teletypewriter. 

Gilbert  S.  Vernam  was— if  things  were  as  usual— a little  late  that  morning. 
He  nearly  always  was,  and,  his  boss  said,  “It  used  to  burn  me  up  to  see  him 
come  sneaking  in  and,  slink  into  his  seat.”  The  yearbook  of  his  alma  mater, 
Worcester  Polytechnic  Institute,  had  wondered  “what  would  happen  to  Tech 
if  ‘Tau’  should  accidently  get  to  class  on  time  in  the  morning.” 

A native  of  Brooklyn,  Vernam  was  graduated  from  the  Massachusetts 
college,  where  he  had  been  president  of  the  Wireless  Association  and  had  been 
elected  to  Tau  Beta  Pi,  the  engineering  honorary  society,  in  1914,  after  having 
spent  a year  working.  He  immediately  joined  A.  T.  & T.  and,  a year  later, 
married  a Brooklyn  girl,  Alline  L.  Eno.  They  had  one  child.  Vernam  was  a 
clever  young  man — one  of  the  stories  about  him  has  him  stretched  on  his 
couch  each  evening  wondering  aloud,  “What  can  I invent  now?”  He  had  the 
rare  type  of  mind  that  can  visualize  an  electrical  circuit  and  put  it  down  on 
paper  without  having  to  try  it  out  with  wires.  He  did  so  well  in  the  telegraph 
section  that  its  head,  Ralzemond  D.  Parker,  assigned  him  to  a special  secrecy 
project.  And  late  though  he  may  have  been  that  winter  morning,  Vernam  had 
brought  a bright  idea  to  work  with  him.  Quiet  and  unassuming,  though  with 
a droll  sense  of  humor,  he  probably  put  forth  his  suggestion  with  diffidence, 
but  his  co-workers  on  the  secrecy  project  saw  at  once  that  he  had  something. 

The  project  had  begun  during  the  summer,  a few  months  after  war  had 
been  declared,  when  Parker  directed  some  of  the  telegraph  section  members  to 
investigate  the  security  of  the  printing  telegraph.  Would  its  very  newness,  the 
fact  that  the  enemy  might  not  have  developed  such  means,  guard  its  messages  ? 
The  secrecy  group  soon  found  that  it  did  not.  The  fluctuations  of  the  current 
could  be  recorded  by  an  oscillograph  and  the  messages  read  with  ease.  Even 
multiplexing — sending  several  messages  simultaneously  in  both  directions 

394

over  a single  wire — offered  no  real  security.  The  engineers  resolved  the  oscillo- 
graph undulation  into  its  constituent  curves  and  read  the  eight  individual 
messages.  The  group  discussed  altering  connections  inside  the  printing 
telegraph  mechanism.  This  would  have  the  effect  of  enciphering  one  letter 
into  another  in  a monalphabetic  substitution.  The  engineers  realized  that 
this  offered  no  real  secrecy  but,  stymied,  did  not  pursue  the  matter  until 
Vernam  bounded  in  with  his  idea. 

It  was  based  upon  the  Baudot  code,  the  Morse  code  of  the  teletypewriter. 
In  this  code,  named  for  its  French  inventor,  J.  M.  E.  Baudot,  each  character  is 
allotted  five  units,  or  pulses.  Each  unit  consists  of  either  an  electrical  current 
or  its  absence  in  a given  time.  There  are,  consequently,  32  different  combina- 
tions of  marks  and  spaces,  and  a combination  is  assigned  to  each  character — 
26  for  the  letters  and  one  each  for  the  six  “stunts”  (space  between  words, 
shift  up  to  numbers  and  punctuation  marks,  shift  back  down  to  letters,  return 
type-carriage  to  left  side  of  paper,  feed  paper  up  a line,  and  idle).  Through  an 
electrical  arrangement  involving  rotating  commutators,  the  proper  sequence 
of  pulses  is  sent  out  when  a character’s  key  is  struck  on  the  keyboard.  For 
example,  a is  mark  mark  space  space  space,  i is  space  mark  mark  space  space 
and  the  figure  shift  is  mark  mark  space  mark  mark.  At  the  receiving  end,  the 
incoming  pulses  energize  electromagnets  that,  in  combination,  select  the 
proper  character  and  print  it.  In  the  punched  paper  tape  which  is  frequently 
used  to  run  teletypewriters,  marks  are  represented  by  holes  and  spaces  by 
leaving  the  tape  intact.  To  read  the  tape,  metal  fingers  push  through  the  holes 
to  make  contact  and  thereby  send  pulses;  where  there  is  a space,  the  paper 
keeps  the  fingers  from  completing  the  circuit. 

Vernam  suggested  punching  a tape  of  key  characters  and  electromechanic- 
ally  adding  its  pulses  to  those  of  the  plaintext  characters,  the  “sum”  to  con- 
stitute the  ciphertext.  The  addition  would  have  to  be  reversible  so  that  the 
receiver  could  subtract  the  key  pulses  from  the  cipher  pulses  and  get  the 
plaintext.  Vernam  decided  upon  this  rule:  If  the  key  and  the  plaintext  pulses 
are  both  marks  or  both  spaces,  the  ciphertext  pulse  will  be  a space.  If  the  key 
pulse  is  a space,  and  the  plaintext  a mark,  or  vice  versa — if,  in  other  words, 
the  two  are  different — the  ciphertext  pulse  will  be  a mark.  The  four  possibili- 
ties are  these: 


plaintext 

mark 

+ 

key 

mark 

_ 

ciphertext

mark 

space 

+ 

mark 

= 

mark 

space 

+

Decipherment  is  unambiguous.  For  example,  with  ciphertext  mark  and  key 
space  only  mark  is  possible  for  the  plaintext.  The  whole  system  may  be  set 
out  in  a single,  compact  table.  Using  the  convenient  notation  of  1 for  mark 
and  0 for  space,  the  rule  would  be  tabulated  as  follows:

In  accordance  with  this  rule,  Vernam  combined  the  five  pulses  of  the 
plaintext  character  with  the  five  of  the  key  character  to  obtain  the  five  pulses 
of  the  ciphertext  character.  Thus,  if  the  plaintext  is  a,  or  1 1000,  and  the  key  is 
10011,  which  happens  to  be  B,  the  encipherment  is  this: 


plaintext  110  0 0 

key  10  0 11 


ciphertext  0 10  11 


At  the  receiving  end,  the  key  pulses  are  applied  one  by  one  to  the  successive 
ciphertext  pulses;  the  rule  determines  the  plaintext  pulses.  With  cipher  pulses 
10100,  and  the  key  pulses  001 10,  the  plaintext  would  be: 


ciphertext  10  10  0 
key  0 0 110 


plaintext  1 0 0 1 0,  or  d. 


To  combine  the  pulses  electrically  Vernam  devised  an  arrangement  of 
magnets,  relays,  and  bus-bars.  Since  encipherment  and  decipherment  were 
reciprocal,  the  same  arrangement  served  for  both.  He  fed  the  pulses  into  this 
device  from  two  tape  readers — one  for  a keytape,  the  other  for  the  plaintext 
tape.  The  mechanism  closed  a circuit,  resulting  in  a mark,  when  the  two  in- 
coming pulses  were  different,  and  opened  a circuit,  resulting  in  a space,  when 
they  were  the  same.  This  output  of  marks  and  spaces  could  be  transmitted 
just  like  an  ordinary  teletypewriter  message  to  the  receiver.  Here  the  Vernam 
apparatus  subtracted  out  the  key  pulses,  which  were  supplied  by  an  identical 
keytape,  and  recreated  the  original  plaintext  pulses.  These  it  would  channel 
into  a teletypewriter  receiver,  which  would  print  out  the  plaintext,  just  like 
a news  ticker  in  a city  room. 

That  was  the  beauty  of  it.  No  longer  did  men  have  to  encipher  or  decipher 
a message  in  a separate  step  (though  they  still  had  to  prepare  keytapes,  insert 
them  in  the  apparatus,  etc.,  since  doing  away  with  these  would  dispense  with 
secrecy  altogether).  Plaintext  went  in  and  plaintext  came  out,  while  anyone 
intercepting  the  message  between  the  two  endpoints  would  pick  up  nothing 
but  a meaningless  sequence  of  marks  and  spaces.  Messages  were  enciphered, 
transmitted,  received,  and  deciphered  in  a single  operation — exactly  as  fast  as 
a message  in  plain  English.  The  advantage  was  not  the  mechanical  encipher- 
ing and  printing  of  the  message.  That  had  been  accomplished  as  far  back  as 


397 


Secrecy  for  Sale 

the  early  1870s  by  two  Frenchmen,  Emile  Vinay  and  Joseph  Gaussin — 
though  not  with  the  speed  and  ease  of  a typewriter  keyboard.  Rather  it  was 
the  assimilation  of  encipherment  into  the  overall  communication  process. 
Vernam  created  what  came  to  be  called  “on-line  encipherment”  (because  it 
was  done  directly  on  the  open  telegraph  circuit)  to  distinguish  it  from  the  old, 
separate,  off-line  encipherment.  He  freed  a fundamental  process  in  crypto- 
graphy from  the  shackles  of  time  and  error.  He  eliminated  a human  being — 
the  cipher  clerk — from  the  chain  of  communication.  His  great  contribution 
was  to  bring  to  cryptography  the  automation  that  had  benefited  mankind  so 
much  in  so  many  fields  of  endeavor. 

These  values  were  immediately  recognized,  and  Vernam’s  idea  quickly 
kicked  up  a flurry  of  activity.  He  put  it  down  on  paper  in  a sketch  dated 
December  17.  A.  T.  & T.  notified  the  Navy,  with  which  it  had  worked  closely 
in  a communications  demonstration  the  previous  year,  and  on  February  18, 
1918,  Vernam,  Parker,  Lyman  F.  Morehouse,  equipment  engineer  of  the 
telephone  company,  and  Edward  Watson  explained  the  Vernam  system, 
together  with  some  other  possibilities,  to  a Lieutenant  Griffiths.  On  March  27, 
the  engineers  conferred  with  colleagues  of  the  Western  Electric  Company, 
A.  T.  & T.’s  manufacturing  subsidiary,  and  began  constructing  a couple  of 
Vernam  devices,  using  as  many  standard  parts  as  possible.  They  hooked  them 
up  to  two  teletypewriters  and,  in  the  Western  Electric  laboratory,  ran  the 
first  tests  of  what  the  engineers  called  “automatic  cryptography.”  The  devices 
worked  like  a charm.  A.  T.  & T.  reported  this  to  the  Army.  Major  Joseph  O. 
Mauborgne,  then  head  of  the  Signal  Corp’s  research  and  engineering  division, 
came,  saw  and  was  conquered.  Except  for  the  problem  of  the  keys. 

In  the  first  days  of  development,  the  Vernam  keys  took  the  form  of  loops 
of  tape  perforated  with  characters  drawn  from  a hat,  giving  a random  keytext. 
The  engineers,  who  were  rapidly  learning  about  cryptology,  probably  from 
Hitt’s  Manual,  soon  spotted  the  flaw  in  this.  The  Vernam  system  is  a poly- 
alphabetic.  A 32  x 32  tableau  may  be  set  up  with  the  32  characters  of  the 
Baudot  alphabet  across  the  top  as  plaintext  and  down  the  side  as  keys.  Be- 
cause the  Baudot  alphabet  is  public  information,  the  composition  of  the  32 
cipher  alphabets  filling  the  body  of  the  tableau  would  be  known.  Secrecy  in 
the  Vernam  system  thus  resides  entirely  in  its  keys.  Looped  keytapes  would 
pass  through  the  Vernam  mechanism  at  regular  intervals,  permitting  a simple 
Kasiski  solution,  even  though  the  key  recovered  would  be  incoherent.  The 
engineers  made  the  keytapes  extremely  long  to  increase  the  difficulty  of  such 
a solution.  But  then  the  keytapes  became  too  hard  to  handle. 

Engineer  Morehouse  surmounted  these  difficulties  by  combining  two 
short  keytapes  of  different  lengths  in  a Vernam  device  as  if  one  were  encipher- 
ing the  other  and  using  the  extremely  lengthy  output — called  the  secondary 
key — as  the  key  for  plaintext.  If  one  loop  were  1,000  characters  long  and  the 
other  999,  the  one-character  difference  would  produce  999,000  combinations 
before  the  sequence  would  repeat.  Thus  two  tapes  each  about  eight  feet  long 


398  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

would  breed  a key  that  would  extend  8,000  feet  on  a single  tape.  This  was  a 
major  practical  improvement. 

But  Mauborgne  recognized  that  even  this  system  was  not  immune  to 
cryptanalysis.  The  future  Chief  Signal  Officer,  then  36,  was  an  extraordinary 
cryptanalyst.  He  had  studied  the  subject  at  the  Army  Signal  School  with 
Parker  Hitt,  was  thoroughly  conversant  with  its  techniques,  had  devised  a 
solution  for  the  hitherto  unsolved  Playfair,  and  almost  certainly  knew  of 
Friedman’s  Riverbank  Publications,  including  No.  17  on  solving  running-key. 
cryptograms.  He  therefore  saw  that  heavy  traffic  raised  the  possibility  of  a 
Kerckhoffs  superimposition,  even  with  the  two-tape  system.  Moreover, 
probable  words  would  enable  the  cryptanalyst  to  recover  the  secondary  key. 
He  could  then  test  the  various  possibilities  for  the  two  primary  keys  at  inter- 
vals of  999  and  1,000  letters,  and  so  gradually  build  them  up.  Mauborgne 
demonstrated  this  to  the  A.  T.  & T.  engineers  with  the  keywords  RIFLE  and 
THOMAS. 

Mauborgne  had  himself  perhaps  participated  in  work  at  the  Army 
Signal  School  several  years  earlier  that  had  concluded  (before  Friedman's 
solution)  that  the  only  safe  running  key  was,  in  Parker  Hitt’s  words,  one 
“comparable  in  length  with  the  message  itself.”  Mauborgne’s  study  of  the 
A.  T.  & T.  system  brought  this  home  to  him  more  forcefully.  Any  repetition 
of  any  kind  in  the  keys  of  cryptograms  under  analysis  imperils  them  and 
perhaps  dooms  them  to  solution.  It  does  not  matter  whether  the  repetitions 
lie  within  a single  message  or  among  several,  arise  from  the  interaction  of 
repeating  primary  keys  or  from  the  simple  repeating  of  a single  long  key. 
Repetitions  in  the  key  could  not  be  permitted.  At  the  same  time,  Friedman’s 
work  had  demonstrated  that  running  keys  could  not  be  intelligible.  To  avoid 
the  Scylla  of  repetition  and  the  Charybdis  of  intelligibility,  keys  would  have 
to  be,  Mauborgne  realized,  both  endless  and  senseless.  He  therefore  welded 
together  the  randomness  of  the  key,  created,  perhaps  almost  accidentally,  by 
Vernam,  and  the  nonrepetition  of  the  key,  discovered  by  the  Army  Signal 
School  cryptologists,  into  what  is  now  called  the  “one-time  system.”  It  con- 
sists of  a random  key  used  once,  and  only  once.  It  provides  a new  and  un- 
predictable key  character  for  each  plaintext  character  in  the  whole  ensemble 
of  messages  ever  to  be  sent  by  a group  of  correspondents. 

And  it  is  an  unbreakable  system.  Some  systems  are  unbreakable  in  practice 
only,  because  the  cryptanalyst  can  conceive  of  ways  of  solving  them  if  he  had 
enough  text  and  enough  time.  The  one-time  system  is  unbreakable  both  in 
theory  and  in  practice.  No  matter  how  much  text  a cryptanalyst  had  available 
in  it,  or  how  much  time  he  had  to  work  on  it,  he  could  never  solve  it.  This  is 
why: 

To  solve  a polyalphabetic  cipher  is  essentially  to  gather  all  the  letters  that 
are  enciphered  in  a single  alphabet  into  a homogeneous  group  that  may  be 
studied  for  its  linguistic  traits.  The  techniques  of  this  collection  differ,  as  do 
the  kinds  of  keys.  Thus  a Kasiski  examination  sifts  out  the  identically  keyed 


399 


Secrecy  for  Sale 

letters  in  a repeating  key.  A running  key  with  a coherent  text  can  be  solved  by 
reciprocally  reconstructing  the  plaintext  and  the  keytext.  A running  key  with 
a random  text  used  in  two  or  more  messages  succumbs  to  a simultaneous  re- 
construction of  the  two  plaintexts,  one  checking  the  other.  Other  polyalpha- 
betics,  such  as  the  autokey  and  the  two-tape  system,  engender  specialized 
solutions  that  stem  from  their  own  peculiarities.  The  monalphabetically 
enciphered  letters  that  are  the  goal  of  these  techniques  also  exist  in  a Vernam 
one-time  system  cryptogram  because  the  32  available  cipher  alphabets  are 
used  over  and  over  again.  But  the  cryptanalyst  has  no  way  of  sorting  them 
out  because  the  key  in  a one-time  system  neither  repeats,  nor  recurs,  nor 
makes  sense,  nor  erects  internal  frameworks.  Hence,  his  methods,  all  based  in 
one  way  or  another  on  these  characteristics,  all  fail.  The  perfect  randomness 
of  the  one-time  system  nullifies  any  horizontal,  or  lengthwise,  cohesion,  as 
in  coherent  running  key  or  autokey,  and  its  one-time  nature  bars  any  vertical 
assembly  in  Kasiski  or  Kerckhoffs  columns,  as  in  keys  repeated  in  a single 
message  or  among  several  messages.  The  cryptanalyst  is  blocked. 

How  about  trial  and  error?  It  seems  as  if  brute  testing  of  all  possible  keys, 
one  after  another,  would  eventually  yield  the  plaintext.  Success  this  way  is  an 
illusion.  For  while  exhaustive  trials  would  indeed  bring  out  the  true  plaintext, 
they  would  also  bring  out  every  other  possible  text  of  the  same  length,  and 
there  would  be  no  way  to  tell  which  was  the  right  one.  Suppose  that  the 
cryptanalyst  deciphers  a four-letter  military  message  with  every  key,  begin- 
ning with  AAAA.  He  strikes  plaintext  at  key  AABI : kiss.  Unlikely  in  this 
context.  He  presses  on.  Key  AAEL  yields  plaintext  kill.  Better — but  he  wants 
to  make  sure.  He  continues  through  key  AAEM,  giving  kilt,  which  might  be 
an  oblique  reference  to  a Scottish  maneuver,  and  AAER,  kiln.  Further  down 
the  line  he  reaches  fast  at  GZBM  and  slow  at  KHIA,  stop  at  HRIW  and 
gogo  at  XSTT,  hard  at  PZVQ  and  easy  at  RZBU.  He  finds  when  he  ends  at 
ZZZZ  that  he  has  merely  compiled  a list  of  every  possible  four-letter  word — 
the  hard  way.  He  can  no  more  pick  the  right  solution  from  this  list  than  he 
can  from  a dictionary  of  military  terms.  The  key  does  not  help  in  limiting  the 
selection  because,  since  it  is  random,  any  group  of  four  letters  is  as  acceptable 
a keytext  as  any  other.  The  worst  of  it  is  that  the  possible  solutions  increase 
as  the  message  lengthens.  There  are  only  three  possible  solutions  for  a one- 
letter  cryptogram,  but  dozens  for  those  of  two  letters,  and  zillions  for  those 
of  100. 

A final  hope  flickers.  Suppose  that  the  cryptanalyst  obtains  the  plaintext  of 
a given  cryptogram,  perhaps  through  theft  or  the  error  of  a radio  operator. 
Can  he  use  the  key  that  he  can  recover  to  determine  the  system  on  which  that 
key  was  built,  and  so  predict  future  keys?  No,  because  a random  key  has  no 
underlying  system — if  it  did,  it  would  not  be  random. 

These  are  empiric  proofs.  It  is  possible,  however,  to  demonstrate  a priori 
that  the  one-time  system  is  unbreakable.  This  constitutes  the  proof  that  it  is 
theoretically  unbreakable.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


In  essence,  the  Vernam  encipherment  constitutes  an  addition — an  addition 
based  on  the  Baudot  alphabet,  but  an  addition  nonetheless.  Suppose  then  that 
the  plaintext  is  4 and  the  key  is  5.  The  ciphertext  will  be  9.  Now,  given  only 
this,  the  cryptanalyst  has  no  way  of  knowing  whether  it  results  from  the 
addition  of  7 + 2,  or  6 + 3,  or  — 2 + 1 1 , or  4 + 5,  or  any  other  of  the  32  possible 
combinations.  Generalized,  the  situation  is  x+y  — 9.  Mathematicians  call 
this  an  equation  in  two  unknowns,  and  a single  such  equation  has  no  unique 
solution.  Two  equations  with  the  same  two  unknowns  are  required.  The  one- 
time system  prevents  the  cryptanalyst  from  ever  bringing  two  or  more  such 
equations  together.  The  utter  absence  of  any  pattern  whatsoever  within  its 
key  precludes  him  from  finding  two  occurrences  of  a given  key  character  by 
reconstructing  a pattern.  And  the  tape’s  exhaustless  novelty  makes  it  impos- 
sible for  him  to  locate  these  occurrences  in  any  key  repetitions.  The  crypt- 
analyst is  thus  denied  any  chance  of  getting  additional  information  to  delimit 
one  of  the  unknowns;  he  is  left  with  all  32  possibilities  for  the  key  character, 
and  consequently  all  32  for  the  plaintext.  True  it  is  that  in  the  cryptanalytic 
case  of  an  equation  in  two  unknowns,  some  solutions  are  more  probable  than 
others.  Thus,  there  is  a 12  per  cent  chance  that  the  plaintext  unknown  is  e, 
an  8 per  cent  chance  that  it  is  t,  and  so  on  down  the  frequency  table.  But  this 
does  not  answer  the  cryptanalyst’s  question,  for  it  does  not  specify  which  of 
these  probabilities  is  actually  present  in  the  individual  case  before  him. 

So  the  answers  again  evade  the  cryptanalyst.  Formless,  endless,  the  ran- 
dom one-time  tape  vanquishes  him  by  dissolving  in  chaos  on  the  one  hand 
and  infinity  on  the  other.  Here  indeed  the  cryptanalyst  gropes  through  caverns 
measureless  to  man.  His  quest  is  Faustian;  who  would  dare  it  would  know 
more  than  can  be  known. 

Why,  then,  is  this  ultimate  cipher  not  in  universal  use?  Because  of  the 
stupendous  quantities  of  key  required.  The  problems  of  producing,  register- 
ing, distributing,  and  canceling  the  keys  may  seem  slight  to  an  individual  who 
has  not  had  experience  with  military  communications,  but  in  wartime  the 
volumes  of  traffic  stagger  even  the  signal  staffs.  Hundreds  of  thousands  of 
words  may  be  enciphered  in  a day;  simply  to  generate  the  millions  of  key 
characters  required  would  be  enormously  expensive  and  time-consuming. 
Since  each  message  must  have  its  unique  key,  application  of  the  ideal  system 
would  require  shipping  out  on  tape  at  the  very  least  the  equivalent  of  the  total 
communications  volume-  of  a war.  In  fact,  however,  considerable  extra  key 
material  would  have  to  be  supplied.  A group  of  subordinate  units  may  possess 
some  tape  in  common  for  intercommunication,  but  once  one  unit  uses  a roll 
of  keytape,  the  others  must  cancel  their  identical  rolls,  in  practice,  this  step  is 
the  most  difficult.  It  is  virtually  impossible  in  the  hubbub  of  battle  to  monitor 
the  messages  of  a dozen  other  units  to  determine  what  keytapes  they  have 
used. 

In  general,  the  physical  problems  bar  employing  a one-time  system  in  a 
fluid  situation,  such  as  military  operations  in  the  field.  These  difficulties  do  not

hold  for  more  stable  situations,  such  as  exist  at  high  military  headquarters,  at 
diplomatic  posts,  or  in  a two-way  spy  correspondence — and  in  such  situations 
one-time  systems  are  practicable  and  are  used.  Even  here,  however,  difficulties 
arise  if  traffic  volume  is  heavy. 

Such  was  the  case  when  Mauborgne,  in  the  first  large-scale  trial  of  the 
Vernam  system,  set  up  machines  in  Hoboken,  Washington,  and  Newport 
News,  and  soon  had  as  many  as  135  messages  a day  flying  between  them  with 
speed  and  reliability.  Even  with  this  relatively  low  volume,  it  apparently 
proved  impossible  to  produce  sufficient  key  for  a one-time  system.  Con- 
sequently, Mauborgne  fell  back  upon  the  Morehouse  two-tape  system  as  the 
next  best  thing.  In  May,  1918,  he  paved  the  way  for  the  first  cryptanalytic 
test  of  the  several  keying  procedures  of  the  Vernam  system  when  he  told 
Bancroft  Gherardi,  assistant  chief  engineer  of  the  telephone  company,  about 
Fabyan’s  Riverbank  Laboratories. 

“I  am  not  a cipher  expert,”  Gherardi  wrote  Fabyan  on  June  1 1,  enclosing 
seven  test  cryptograms,  “and  would  not  presume  to  say  what  can  and  cannot 
be  done,  but  should  you  and  Professor  Friedman  decipher  messages  Nos.  1, 
5,  6,  and  7, 1 shall  feel  that  I owe  you  both  a good  dinner.  I have  no  doubt  that 
you  can  decipher  Nos.  2,  3,  and  perhaps  4.  These,  however,  as  you  understand, 
are  not  the  arrangement  which  we  propose.”  Friedman  was  overseas  in 
g.2  a. 6,  but  soon  after  his  return  he  solved  Messages  2 and  3,  and  part  of  4. 
Since  all  three  used  the  same  portions  of  a single  keytape  of  2,000  random 
characters  (except  that  4 ran  longer),  a tentative  recovery  in  one  could  be 
tested  against  the  others  by  deciphering  with  the  resultant  key.  Messages  5,  6, 
and  7 were  enciphered  with  the  two-tape  system,  started  at  different  points, 
and  though  Friedman  seems  not  to  have  broken  these,  owing  to  their  brevity, 
he  did  solve  the  messages  in  the  tri-city  traffic,  which  used  the  same  system. 
No.  1 was  enciphered  in  the  true  one-time  system.  It  shared  its  random  key- 
tape  with  no  other  messages.  And  it,  of  course,  was  never  solved. 

In  September  of  1918,  Vernam  himself  went  down  to  Washington  to  file 
his  patent  application  on  Friday  the  13th.  The  war  ended  without  any  wide- 
spread application  of  the  system  before  the  patent — No.  1,310,719,  and 
perhaps  the  most  important  in  the  history  of  cryptology— was  granted  on 
July  22,  1919.  But  A.  T.  & T.  also  saw  possible  peacetime  profits  in  the 
invention.  On  October  21,  1920,  the  company  demonstrated  it  before  foreign 
postal  officials  at  the  Preliminary  International  Communications  Conference 
by  radioing  Vernam-system  cryptograms  from  New  York  to  Cliffwood,  New 
Jersey,  and  wiring  them  back  again.  On  the  afternoon  of  February  9,  1926, 
Vernam  delivered  a paper  and  ran  his  machine  before  the  midwinter  conven- 
tion of  the  American  Institute  of  Electrical  Engineers  in  New  York. 

But  though  the  device  was  an  engineering  success,  it  proved  a commercial 
failure.  Cable  companies  and  business  firms,  which  A.  T.  & T.  hoped  would 
buy  cipher  attachments  for  its  teletypewriters,  passed  it  over  in  favor  of  the 
old-fashioned  commercial  codes,  which  substantially  shortened  messages.

thereby  cutting  cable  tolls,  and  which  gave  a modicum  of  secrecy  as  well.  The 
armed  forces  budgets  had  shrunk  to  their  peacetime  tightness ; cryptologically, 
the  physical  difficulties  forced  Army  communicators  back  onto  the  two-tape 
system,  and  the  demonstrated  solvability  of  this  threw  the  whole  Vernam 
arrangement  into  temporary  limbo. 

At  about  the  same  time  on  the  other  side  of  the  Atlantic,  cryptologists  saw 
things  differently.  Three  experts  in  the  German  Foreign  Office — -Werner 
Kunze,  who  was  strongly  mathematical  in  his  approach ; Rudolf  Schauffler, 
an  all-round  cryptologist  who  specialized  in  East  Asian  languages  and  later 
received  a doctorate  in  mathematics;  and  Erich  Langlotz,  who  had  been 
educated  as  a chemist  and  was  more  involved  in  the  practical  problems  than 
the  others — were  given  the  task  of  providing  security  for  their  own  diplomatic 
communications.  Enciphered  code  was  then  the  customary  method  for 
diplomatic  communications.  Often  the  encipherment  took  the  form  of  an 
additive.  The  numerical  codegroups  of  a diplomatic  or  military  code  were 
disguised  by  adding  to  them  a numerical  key,  usually  fairly  long.  For  example, 
to  the  placode  3043  9710  3964  3043  . . . , the  code  clerk  would  add  the  key 
7260  0940  5169  4174  ...  by  noncarrying  addition  (tens  digits  are  neither 
written  down  nor  carried).  The  result,  0203  9650  8023  7117  ... , effectively 
conceals  the  repeated  3043  in  the  original  message.  Kunze,  at  least,  was  well 
aware  of  the  difficulties  of  affording  secrecy:  he  was  then  scraping  a non- 
additive superencipherment  from  a French  number  code  that  employed  40  or 
50  two-digit  encipherment  tables.*  The  trio  studied  ciphers  with  longer  and 
longer  additives  and  they  eventually  concluded  that  the  only  system  that  is 
absolutely  unbreakable  is  the  one  with  a random,  nonrepeating  additive  key — 
the  equation  in  two  unknowns.  Some  time  between  1921  and  1923  they 
instituted  the  system  in  the  German  diplomatic  establishment. 

It  took  the  form  of  pads  of  50  numbered  sheets  of  legal-size  paper,  each 
with  48  five-digit  groups  distributed  in  eight  lines  of  six  groups  each.  The  240 
digits  were  random,  and  no  sheet  duplicated  any  other.  Each  pad  was  entirely 
different  from  every  other  (except  for  its  mate  for  deciphering  purposes).  The 
digits  constituted  the  key  that  was  added  to  the  number  groups  of  the  German 
codes.  Langlotz  supervised  the  distribution  of  the  pads,  giving  the  embassy  at 
Washington,  say,  one  set  for  outgoing  and  another  for  incoming  messages  to 

* The  code  used  four-digit  groups,  but  the  French  divided  the  codetext  into  clusters  of 
five  figures,  and  divided  each  cluster  into  two  pairs,  which  were  enciphered  by  the  tables, 
and  a single  figure,  which  was  left  unenciphered.  The  encipherment  thus  straddled  from  one 
codegroup  to  another.  The  French  furthermore  cut  the  clusters  in  three  ways:  with  the 
single  figure  at  the  beginning,  with  it  between  the  two  pairs,  and  with  it  following  them. 
Kunze  began  working  on  the  superencipherment  in  1921  and  had  reconstructed  it  by  1923. 
He  returned  to  the  system  in  1927-28  and  solved  the  code,  which  the  French  were  still  using. 
By  then  they  were  combining  the  single  digit  of  one  cluster  with  that  of  another  and  en- 
ciphering them  as  a pair.  For  instance,  the  imaginary  codetext  8975  4263  . . . would  be 
divided  8 97  54  2 63  ... , and  the  8 and  2 would  be  enciphered  together,  as  well  as  the  97, 
the  54,  etc.  Kunze  solved  that  variation  as  well.

and  from  Berlin,  and  similar  double  sets  for  communicating  with  all  German 
legations.  The  code  clerks  used  a different  sheet  for  every  message,  tearing  it 
off  when  they  were  through,  and  never  using  the  same  sheet  twice.  Thus, 
though  the  addition  was  done  by  hand  and  involved  numbers  as  opposed  to 
the  Vernam  electrical  addition  of  pulses,  the  principle — and  the  unsolvability 
— was  the  same.  It  soon  became  known  as  the  “one-time  pad”  system,  the 
name  by  which  systems  using  random,  nonrepeating  keys  are  now  generally 
known,  though  the  mechanical  embodiment  is  sometimes  called  a “one-time 
tape”  system.  For  the  first  time  in  history,  the  official  communications  of  a 
government  were  absolutely  secure  against  the  prying  eyes  of  others. 

Not  those  of  the  United  States,  however.  Though  the  system  was  invented 
in  America,  though  an  article  by  Vernam  headed  a convention  issue  of  the 
important  Journal  of  the  American  Institute  of  Electrical  Engineers,  though  his 
talk  was  picked  up  by  the  mass-circulation  Literary  Digest  and  the  general 
scientific  weekly  Science,  though  Yardley  brought  Vernam’s  device  to  the 
attention  of  a high  State  Department  official,  mentioned  it  in  his  sensational 
book,  and  later  tried  to  embarrass  the  department  into  using  it  in  a needling 
magazine  article — despite  all  this,  the  United  States  remained  blind  to  the 
unbreakable  system. 

The  Army  revived  it  in  a hurry  as  sigtot  when  World  War  II  loomed, 
but  by  then  Vernam  was  well  out  of  it.  He  had  continued  developmental  work 
at  A.  T.  & T.  for  several  years.  He  improved  his  own  system,*  invented  a 
device  for  enciphering  handwriting  during  telautograph  transmission,  and 
came  up  with  one  of  the  earliest  forms  of  binary  digital  encipherment  of 
pictures — another  precocious  development.  He  was  so  good  that  he  was 
grabbed  off  at  a substantial  raise  by  International  Telephone  and  Telegraph 
Corporation’s  cryptographic  subsidiary.  International  Communication 
Laboratories,  where  Parker  Hitt  was  vice  president.  Four  months  later  the 
stock  market  crashed.  Vernam,  with  no  seniority,  was  soon  out.  He  went  to 
Postal  Telegraph  Cable  Company,  which  merged  with  Western  Union.  His 
inventive  spark  flared  from  time  to  time,  and  he  was  granted  65  patents  in 
all,  among  them  such  important  noncryptologic  items  as  the  semiautomatic 
torn-tape  relay  system,  the  push-button  switching  systems,  and  finally  the 
fully  automatic  telegraph  switching  system,  all  for  the  Air  Force’s  200,000- 
mile  domestic  network. 

But  the  reversal  in  his  personal  fortunes  seemed  to  depress  him.  Each 
night  he  sank  deeper  and  deeper  into  the  newspaper.  Finally,  on  February  7, 
1960,  after  a long  bout  with  Parkinson’s  disease,  the  man  who  had  automated 
cryptography  died  in  obscurity  in  his  home  in  Hackensack,  New  Jersey. 

* In  its  original  form,  the  ciphertext  included  the  stunt  characters.  This  made  it  difficult 
to  record  the  ciphertext  on  paper.  The  sudden  appearance  of  a figure  shift  would  abruptly 
convert  a literal  cryptogram  into  one  of  numbers  and  punctuation  marks.  A carriage  return 
without  a paper  feed  would  result  in  an  overline.  To  prevent  this,  Vernam  added  some  cir- 
cuits that  would  cause  the  stunts  to  print  as  two-letter  groups.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


It  is  self-evident  that,  as  the  number  of  plaintext  elements  increase,  so  does 
the  security  of  a cryptosystem.  Thus  a large  code  is  harder  to  solve  than  a 
small  one.  Similarly,  among  cipher  systems  in  which  only  a single  set  of 
plain-to-cipher  equivalents  is  used  (that  is,  nonpolyalphabetic  systems), 
those  enciphering  two  letters  at  a time  offer  more  resistance  than  those 
encipherirg  just  one  at  a time,  all  other  things  being  equal.  In  other  words,  a 
digraphic  substitution  such  as  the  Playfair  is  stronger  than  a monographic 
substitution.  The  reason  is  that  digraphs  are  harder  to  identify  than  single 
letters — partly  because  there  are  more  to  choose  from,  partly  because  their 
characteristics  are  less  sharply  defined.  These  problems  would  be  aggravated 
for  trigraphic  substitutions,  and  would  rapidly  approach  insuperable  propor- 
tions for  tetragraphic,  pentagraphic,  hexagraphic,  and  even  larger  polygraphic 
substitutions. 

Such  substitutions  have  always  been  possible  in  principle  simply  by  listing 
plaintext  polygraphs  opposite  their  ciphertext  polygraphs.  The  first  such  list 
was  constructed  for  digraphs  when  Porta  set  one  up  as  a tableau,  using  distinc- 
tive symbols  for  each  plaintext  digraph.  Many  digraph  lists  using  letters  have 
been  compiled,  usually  in  big  26  x 26  tables.  But  such  lists  have  almost  never 
been  produced  for  trigrams,  and  never  for  tetragrams  or  larger  polygram 
substitutions.  Their  bulk  (263  or  17,576  entries  for  the  trigraphic,  264  or 
456,976  for  the  tetragraphic,  and  so  on)  is  prohibitive,  and  much  of  the  labor 
would  be  wasted  on  useless  polygrams,  as  jgt  or  it 'qh. 

Ever  since  Wheatstone’s  Playfair  showed  how  a digraphic  substitution 
could  be  achieved  compactly  and  without  a lengthy  list,  other  cryptographers 
have  tried  to  extend  his  geometrical  technique  to  trigraphic  substitution. 
Nearly  all  have  failed.  Perhaps  the  best  known  effort  was  that  of  Count  Luigi 
Gioppi  di  Tiirkheim,  who  in  1897  produced  a pseudo-trigraphic  system  in 
which  two  letters  were  mon alphabetically  enciphered  and  the  third  depended 
only  on  the  second.  Finally,  about  1929,  a young  American  mathematician, 
Jack  Levine,  used  six  5x5  squares  to  encipher  trigraphs  in  an  ingenious 
extension  of  the  Playfair.  But  he  did  not  disclose  his  method. 

This  was  the  situation  when  a 38-year-old  assistant  professor  >of  mathe- 
matics at  Hunter  College  in  New  York  published  a seven-page  paper  entitled 
“Cryptography  in  an  Algebraic  Alphabet”  in  The  American  Mathematical 
Monthly  for  June-July  1929.  He  was  Lester  S.  Hill,  a five-foot-six,  blue-eyed, 
black-haired  native  of  New  York  and  a Phi  Beta  Kappa  graduate  of  Columbia 
College  who  had  taken  his  Ph.D.  in  mathematics  at  Yale  in  1926.  Hill  had 
taught  mathematics  at  the  University  of  Montana,  at  Princeton,  at  the 
University  of  Maine,  and  at  Yale  before  coming  to  Hunter  in  1927.  While  at 
Yale,  he  had  written  three  articles  for  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Age  dealing 
with  mathematical  means  of  checking  the  accuracy  of  telegraphed  code 
numbers.  He  hoped  to  make  some  money  from  his  checking  scheme,  which 
he  was  seeking  to  have  patented.  This  did  not  go  anywhere,  but  it  sparked  in 
Hill  an  interest  in  secret  communications.  Later  in  the  summer  in  which  his 


405 


Secrecy  for  Sale 

paper  on  algebraic  cryptography  appeared,  he  expanded  the  topic  before  the 
American  Mathematical  Society  at  Boulder,  Colorado.  This  lecture  was  later 
published  in  The  American  Mathematical  Monthly  as  “Concerning  Certain 
Linear  Transformation  Apparatus  of  Cryptography.” 

Hill  successfully  used  algebra  as  a process  for  cryptography.  Probably 
many  mathematicians  had  toyed  with  this  idea;  two  proposals  had  even 
reached  print — one  by  a German,  F.  J.  Buck,  as  far  back  as  1772,  the  other  by 
the  young  mathematician  Jack  Levine  in  a 1926  issue  of  a detective  magazine. 
But  Hill  alone  devised  a method  of  power  and  generality.  In  addition,  his 
procedure  made  polygraphic  cryptography  practical  for  the  first  time. 

It  employed  equations  in  which  the  keys  and  plaintext  letters  had  numeri- 
cal values.  Encipherment  consisted  of  solving  the  equations.  There  were  as 
many  equations  as  letters  in  the  polygraph.  Since  there  are  26  letters  in  the 
alphabet,  and  since  he  had  to  make  decipherment  possible,  Hill  performed  his 
computations  modulo  26.  This  means  that  the  mathematician  uses  only  the 
integers  from  0 to  25.  Any  number  higher  than  25  must  be  reduced  by  drop- 
ping out  as  many  multiples  of  26  as  possible;  the  remainder  equals  that 
number  modulo  26.  Thus  28  is  2 modulo  26,  because  28  minus  26  leaves  2. 
Likewise,  68  is  16  modulo  26,  for  68  minus  2 times  26,  or  52,  leaves  16. 

To  demonstrate  a tetragraphic  substitution.  Hill  framed  the  following  set 
of  simultaneous  equations.  The  x's  represent  the  plaintext  letters,  x,  being 
the  first,  x2  the  second,  and  so  on;  the/s  represent  the  ciphertext  letters: 

y j = 8.v1+6.y2+  9.y3  + 5.y4 
y 2 — 6.y1+9.y2+  5.Y3  + IOA4 
y3  = 5,y1+8.y2+  4.Y3+  9,y4 
y4  — lOx, +6.y2  + 1 lx3  + 4.y4 

In  the  first  step  of  actual  encipherment,  Hill  converted  the  letters  of  his  plain- 
text— Delay  operations — into  numbers  according  to  the  following  arbitrary 
alphabet : 

abcdef  g h i j kl  mnopqrst  uvwxyz 
5 23  2 20  10  15  8 4 18  25  0 16  13  7 3 I 19  6 12  24  21  17  14  22  11  9 

Then  he  inserted  the  numerical  values  for  the  first  four-letter  group — dela,  or 
20,  10,  16,  5— into  the  equations  as  xu  x2,  x3,  and  .y4,  resulting  in  the  follow- 
ing: 

y,  =(8x20)  +(6  x 10)  + (9  x 16)  +(5x5) 
y2  = (6  x 20)  +(9  x 10)  +(5  x 16)  +(10x5) 
y>3  = (5  x 20)  +(8  x 10)  +(4  x 16)  +(9x5) 
y4  = (10  x 20)+ (6  x 10)  + (1 1 x 16) +(4x5) 

Hill  then  carried  out  the  multiplications  and  additions  in  each  equation 
modulo  26.  For  example,  solving  for  y , gave:  8x20  = 4,  6x10  = 8, 
9x16=  14,  and  5 x 5 = 25.  They  summed  to  25.  Reverting  to  literal  values, 


406 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


25  became  j,  the  first  cipher  letter.  The  others  were  found  in  the  same  way, 
and  the  full  ciphertext  for  dela  became  jcow.  The  completed  cryptogram  is 
JCOW  ZLVB  DVLE  QMXC. 

Suppose,  now,  that  the  plaintext  message  had  begun  Demand . . . , which 
would  alter  only  the  third  letter  of  the  first  tetragram  from  an  / to  an  m.  The 
replacement  in  the  four  equations  of  the  16  of  / by  the  13  of  m would  change 
the  products  of  the  third  elements  in  each  equation,  thereby  modifying  the 
sums.  Consequently  the  ciphertext  for  dema,  which  is  cmzq,  appears  entirely 
different  from  jcow  of  dela.  Such  a system  is  genuinely  polygraphicy  and  its 
cryptographic  security  is  substantial. 

The  fixed  values  in  the  equations — the  numbers  that  multiply  the  plaintext 
numbers — cannot  be  selected  at  random  if  the  system  is  to  work  in  reverse. 
Hill  specified  the  requirements  and  derived  the  deciphering  equations.  For 
the  above  key,  they  are : 

xl  = 23y1  +20y2  + 5 y3  + 1 y4 
x2  = 2yx  + lly2  + 18y3  + ly4 
x3  = 2y1+20y2+  6y3+25y4 
x4  = 25 yt  + 2y2+22y3+25y4 

Hill  eliminated  separate  deciphering  equations  by  constructing  “involu- 
tory  transformations.”  A single  set  of  these  equations  serves  both  to  encipher 
and  decipher.  Involutory  transformations  are  constructed  according  to  a 
special  formula,  which  limits  their  number  compared  to  noninvolutory  ones. 
In  theory  this  also  reduces  the  cryptanalytical  resistance.  But  the  security  loss 
is  negligible,  especially  when  measured  against  the  increased  facility  of 
operation. 

Hill  further  simplified  the  cipher’s  operation  by  introducing  matrices.  A 
matrix  is  simply  a square  of  numbers.  Matrices  can  be  added  and  multiplied 
together  under  their  own  rules.  The  numbers  in  a matrix  may  represent 
plaintext  letters.  And  since  each  matrix  may  be  handled  arithmetically  as  if 
it  were  a single  number,  two  equations  serve  for  the  encipherment  of  two 
matrices,  no  matter  how  many  numbers  each  contains.  Thus,  by  disposing 
plaintext  in  matrices,  more  letters  can  be  handled  with  fewer  equations.  Thus 
two  3x3  matrices  will  encipher  18  letters  at  a time  with  only  two  equations 
instead  of  the  18  that  would  be  needed  for  the  so-called  linear  encipherment. 
Hill  gave  an  example  of  this  massive  polygraphic  encipherment  in  his  second' 
article.  His  plaintext  was  Hold  out . Supporting  air  squadrons  en  route , and,  using 
a different  numerical  alphabet  than  in  his  first  example,  he  prepared  his  first 
two  x,  or  plaintext,  matrices  as  follows: 

/h  o 1 \ / 5 6 22\  /p  p o\  [2\  21  6\ 

*i  = d o u = 2 6 7 *2  = r t i = 23  12  17 

\t  s u / \12  19  7/  \n  g a / \24  16  4/

These  he  inserted  into  the  equations,  which  are  involutory  and  have  an  extra 
arbitrary  matrix  to  be  added  in  to  further  complicate  the  encipherment: . 

/ 3 6 2\  / 5 6 22\  / 2 6 14\  /21  21  6\  /18  6 6\ 

yx  = 16  23  8 2 6 7 + 8 24  4 23  12  17  + 24  20  22 

\ 2 16  13/  \12  19  7/  \14  16  20/  \24  16  4/  \ 2 2 16/ 

/18  14  22\  / 5 6 22\  /15  16  20\  /21  21  6\  12  16  14\ 

y2  = 20  4 10  2 6 7 + 4 13  2 23  12  17  + 8 12  4 

\22  20  24/  \12  19  7/  \20  8 11/  \24  16  4/  \18  8 20/ 

When  he  performed  the  appropriate  matrix  multiplications  and  additions 
modulo  26,  yt  andy2  were  found  to  be: 

/ 13  20  12\  /y  k t\  /1 3 23  12\  /y  r t \ 

yt  = 1 22  16  23  = l g r y2  = 17  20  15  = i k w 
\16  19  23/  \gsr/  \20  4 20/  \kak/ 

Such  an  encipherment  virtually  obliterates  ciphertext  repetitions.  Even 
if  an  exact  18-letter  plaintext  group  recurs,  it  must  begin  at  exactly  the  same 
point  in  the  encipherment  equation  to  produce  a ciphertext  repetition — and 
there  is  only  one  chance  in  18  of  this  happening.  More  importantly,  a poly- 
graphic encipherment  of  this  magnitude  is  possible  only  with  a Hill  trans- 
formation. The  more  than  40  quintillion  18-letter  groups,  printed  100  to  each 
side  of  a page  with  their  ciphertext  equivalents,  would  fill  a codebook  thicker 
than  the  distance  from  the  sun  to  Pluto. 

Mathematically,  there  is  no  limit  either  to  matrix  size  or  to  the  number  of 
equations.  A cryptographer  may  use  matrices  ten  letters  square  in  five 
simultaneous  equations  to  catapult  500  letters  into  cipher  at  once.  Or  he  may 
set  up  500  simultaneous  linear  equations  each  with  500  terms  to  encipher  that 
regiment  of  letters  together.  From  a practical  standpoint,  the  matrix  method 
is  superior  because  it  enciphers  more  letters  for  a given  amount  of  work  than 
the  linear  method,  and  larger  polygraphs  resist  cryptanalysis  more  strongly 
than  smaller  ones.  But  from  a purely  theoretical  standpoint,  the  matrix 
encipherment  is  less  secure  than  a linear  encipherment  of  the  same  number  of 
letters.  This  is  because  the  linear  encipherment  employs  a greater  number  of 
arbitrary  key  constants  in  its  equations.  Many  of  the  matrix  constants  reduce 
to  zero  when  the  matrix  equations  are  written  out  in  their  linear  equivalent. 
These  play  no  role  in  the  arithmetic.  As  a result,  while  the  change  of  a single 
plaintext  letter  in  a linear  encipherment  will  affect  every  ciphertext  letter, 
such  a change  will  affect  only  every  second  ciphertext  letter  in  a 2 x 2 matrix, 
every  third  in  a 3x3  matrix,  and  so  on.  Conversely,  an  error  in  a linear 
ciphertext  will  garble  the  entire  plaintext  group,  whereas  an  error  in  a matrix 
ciphertext  will  garble  only  every  second  letter,  or  every  third,  or  fourth,  and 
so  on,  depending  on  the  size  of  the  matrix.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


In  general,  the  Hill  system  defends  itself  well  against  the  direct  onslaughts 
of  cryptanalysis.  Without  a knowledge  of  the  basic  letter-to-number  conver- 
sion alphabet,  the  cryptanalyst  may  not  even  be  able  to  start.  Even  with  it,  a 
straightforward  frequency-analysis  attack  is  out  of  the  question:  octogram 
frequencies,  for  example,  are  hard  to  collect  and  even  harder  to  differentiate. 
Probable  words  require  tedious  testing  for  possible  locations  and  then  much 
mathematical  juggling  to  determine  the  correct  equations;  even  so,  only  the 
relatively  trivial  trigraphic  encipherments  have  been  solved.  The  cipher  has, 
however,  at  least  one  curious  chink  in  its  armor.  If  a cryptanalyst  obtains  two 
ciphertexts  resulting  from  a single  plaintext  enciphered  with  different  in- 
volutory  equations  (of  the  same  type  and  polygram  size),  and  if  he  knows  the 
conversion  alphabet,  he  can,  in  general,  recover  the  equations  fairly  easily. 

The  real  obstacle  to  practical  use  of  the  Hill  system  is,  of  course,  its 
ponderousness.  Hill  sought  to  minimize  this  by  patenting  a device  that  will 
encipher  small  polygrams  (up  to  hexagrams).  It  consists  of  a series  of  geared 
wheels  connected  by  a sprocketed  chain  so  that  the  rotation  of  one  wheel  will 
turn  all  the  others,  but  the  range  of  its  keys  appears  to  be  limited.  Mechanisms 
could  also  be  built  to  compute  the  encipherments  of  large  polygrams,  which 
give  the  best  security,  but  they  would  be  so  complicated  that  they  could  not 
compete  on  a practical  basis  with  simpler,  though  possibly  less  secure,  cipher 
machines.  For  such  reasons,  the  Hill  system  has  served  as  a U.S.  govern- 
mental cryptosystem  in  only  one  minor  capacity — to  encipher  the  three-letter 
groups  of  radio  call-signs. 

Hill  never  published  any  further  papers  on  cryptology,  but  he  kept  writing 
them,  turning  over  most  of  his  studies  to  the  Navy  (probably  because  he  was 
a lieutenant  in  that  service  in  World  War  I).  They  mostly  concerned  further 
variations  on  the  polygraphic  scheme  or  elaborate  complications  on  Vigenere- 
type  systems.  But  though  none  ever  approached  his  first  publications  in 
significance,  the  Navy  welcomed  his  suggestions.  In  1955,  Rear  Admiral  H.  C. 
Bruton,  director  of  naval  communications,  wrote  him:  “I  am  pleased  to 
acknowledge  that  you  furnished  material  to  naval  communications  during 
World  War  II,  and  that  the  ideas  presented  were  ingenious,  detailed,  and 
complete.  The  cryptographic  system  which  you  proposed  at  the  time  demon- 
strated competence  and  inventiveness  of  a high  order  in  the  application  of 
advanced  mathematical  concepts  to  the  field  of  cryptography.  May  I again 
express  to  you  the  appreciation  of  naval  communications.  . . .”  Hill  retired 
from  Hunter  in  1960,  and  on  January  9,  1961,  died  in  Lawrence  Hospital  in 
Bronxville,  New  York,  after  a long  illness. 

Although  Hill’s  cipher  system  itself  saw  almost  no  practical  use,  it  had  a 
great  impact  upon  cryptology.  When  he  published  his  articles  in  1929  and 
1931,  cryptology,  like  other  applied  sciences,  was  beginning  its  drift  toward  a 
widespread  application  of  mathematics  to  its  problems.  Friedman  had 
just  linked  cryptanalysis  to  statistics.  Two  of  the  junior  cryptanalysts  he 
hired  were  mathematicians.  Kunze,  in  the  German  Foreign  Office,  a Ph.D.  in

mathematics,  was  applying  his  mathematical  knowledge  to  his  work.  Hill 
accelerated  this  trend. 

The  elegance  and  generality  of  his  work  engaged  the  interest  of  mathe- 
maticians and  cryptologists.  Dr.  A.  Adrian  Albert  was  perhaps  the  first  to 
observe  that,  as  he  put  it,  “all  of  these  methods  [of  cryptography]  are  very 
special  cases  of  the  so-called  algebraic  cipher  systems.”  On  November  22, 
1941,  Albert,  then  36,  professor  of  mathematics  at  the  University  of  Chicago 
and  winner  two  years  before  of  the  Cole  prize  for  outstanding  research  in 
algebra,  expounded  this  view  before  an  American  Mathematical  Society 
meeting  at  Manhattan,  Kansas.  “We  shall  see  that  cryptography  is  more  than 
a subject  permitting  mathematical  formulation,  for  indeed  it  would  not  be  an 
exaggeration  to  state  that  abstract  cryptography  is  identical  with  abstract 
mathematics,”  he  said.  He  adapted  Hill’s  basic  algebraic  idea  to  simple  cipher 
systems,  such  as  transposition,  periodic  Vigenere,  and  autokey,  and  derived 
their  mathematical  equations.  Complicated  systems,  he  explained,  are  often 
merely  “the  product”  of  two  of  these  simple  systems. 

This  reformulation  of  cipher  systems  in  mathematical  terms  bares  their 
essential  structure.  It  shows  up  weaknesses  and  helps  the  cryptographer  to 
correct  them.  It  may  suggest  analyses.  More  importantly,  however,  it  may 
enable  the  cryptanalyst  to  bring  to  bear  mathematical  techniques  that  were 
not  previously  applicable  and  that  make  entirely  new  solutions  possible. 
Take,  for  example,  the  case  of  two  Playfair  cryptograms,  enciphered  in 
different  keysquares  but  known  to  have  the  same  plaintext.  In  the  ordinary 
geometical  solution  of  a Playfair,  the  extra  knowledge  of  the  identical  plain- 
text in  the  second  cryptogram  does  not  assist  in  reconstructing  the  first  key. 
But  if  the  two  ciphertexts  are  translated  into  the  appropriate  mathematical 
equations  for  Playfair,  the  fact  that  the  plaintext  elements  in  these  equations 
are  identical  and  so  may  be  cancelled  out  may  greatly  simplify  finding  the 
unknowns  in  these  equations  and  so  facilitate  solving  the  cryptograms.  Thus 
the  application  of  mathematical  techniques  that  make  explicit  fundamental 
relationships  often  obscured  permits  the  resolution  of  otherwise  intractable 
problems.  In  much  the  same  way,  the  invention  of  the  calculus  made  pre- 
viously unsolvable  problems  solvable.  The  complex  ciphers  generated  by 
modern  electromechanical  means  would  lie  virtually  beyond  cryptanalysis 
without  the  help  of  the  new,  high-powered  mathematical  weapons. 

The  cryptology  of  today  is  saturated  with  mathematical  operations, 
mathematical  methods,  mathematical  thinking.  In  practice,  it  has  become 
virtually  a branch  of  applied  mathematics.  Its  sophistication,  its  range,  and 
its  power  have  grown  far  beyond  the  imaginings  of  the  most  imaginative 
cryptologist  in  Yardley’s  Black  Chamber.  And  in  this  evolution,  Lester  Hill 
was  a prime  mover. 

The  history  of  science  is  replete  with  coincidence.  Adams  and  Leverrier 
deduced  the  existence  of  Neptune  almost  simultaneously.  While  Darwin  was

elaborating  his  theory  of  evolution,  Wallace  sent  him  a short  paper  that 
succinctly  set  it  forth.  Five  years  after  Morse  invented  his  telegraph,  Wheat- 
stone independently  invented  another.  So  it  is  not  surprising  that  coincidence 
brushed  cryptography  in  the  crucible  years  of  the  First  World  War  and  just 
after.  Its  fabled  long  arm  reached  out  and  tapped  four  men  in  four  countries. 
Spurred  by  the  vast  wartime  use  of  secret  communications,  and  beckoned  by 
the  new  age  of  mechanization,  they  independently  created  the  machine  whose 
principle  is  perhaps  the  most  widely  used  in  cryptography  today.  This 
principle  is  that  of  the  wired  codewheel,  the  rotor. 

The  body  of  a rotor  consists  of  a thick  disk  of  insulating  material,  such  as 
Bakelite  or  hard  rubber,  commonly  two  to  four  inches  in  diameter  and  half 
an  inch  thick.  Embedded  around  the  circumference  of  each  face  are  26 
evenly  spaced  electrical  contacts,  often  of  brass.  Each  contact  is  connected  at 
random  by  a wire  to  a contact  on  the  opposite  face.  Thus  a path  for  an 
electric  current  is  set  up  that  starts  at  one  point  on  the  circumference  of  one 
side  and  ends  at  another  point  on  the  other. 

The  contacts  on  the  starting,  or  input,  face  represent  plaintext  letters  and 
those  on  the  output  face  ciphertext  letters.  The  wire  connections  between  the 
two  then  provide  a way  of  converting  plaintext  letters  to  ciphertext.  To 
encipher,  one  need  only  fire  a burst  of  current  into  the  rotor  at  the  input 
contact  of  the  desired  plaintext  letter,  say,  a;  this  current  then  courses  along 
the  wire  to  emerge  at  an  output  contact  representing  the  ciphertext  letter,  say, 
r.  If  a list  be  drawn  up  of  all  the  rotor’s  wire  connections  from  the  plaintext 
to  the  ciphertext  face,  it  will  constitute  a mon  alphabetic  substitution  alpha- 
bet. The  rotor  thus  embodies  a cipher  alphabet  in  a form  suitable  for  electro- 
mechanical manipulation. 

To  carry  out  this  manipulation,  the  rotor  is  placed  between  two  fixed 
plates,  each  also  of  insulating  material  and  with  26  contacts  studded  in  a 
circle  to  match  those  on  each  face  of  the  rotor.  Each  contact  on  the  input 
plate  is  connected  to  a typewriter  key  that  represents  a plaintext  letter.  Each 
contact  on  the  output  plate  is  connected  with  some  kind  of  device  to  indicate 
the  ciphertext  letter,  such  as  a lamp  or  a typebar.  When  the  encipherer 
strikes  the  key  representing  the  plaintext  letter  a,  he  allows  electricity  to  flow 
from  the  power  source,  into  the  input  plate  contact  for  a,  across  the  junction 
into  the  rotor  at  the  input  contact  for  a,  through  the  wire  heart  of  the  rotor 
to  the  output  contact  for  ciphertext  r,  across  to  the  output  plate  contact  for 
r,  and  to  the  bulb  that  lights  up  the  letter  r as  the  ciphertext  letter. 

If  this  were  all  there  was  to  it,  the  rotor  would  not  be  so  remarkable  a 
device.  Each  time  the  a key  was  pressed,  the  current  would  trace  the  same  path 
through  the  rotor  to  indicate  R.  This  would  be  nothing  more  than  a fancy 
and  extremely  expensive  way  of  performing  a monalphabetic  substitution. 

But  there  is  much  more.  The  rotor  does  not  remain  stationary.  It  turns. 
Suppose  that  it  clicks  forward  one  step.  The  current  that  formerly  emerged  at 
r after  starting  at  input  plate  contact  a will  now  exit  at  an  entirely  different

letter  because  a new  rotor  contact,  with  a different  wire  path,  now  stands 
opposite  input  plate  contact  a.  Similarly,  all  the  other  plaintext  letters  will 
have  cipher  letters  different  than  before.  This  creates  a new  ciphertext 
alphabet.  Each  time  the  rotor  moves  forward  a space,  a new  alphabet  comes 
into  play.  A list  of  these  alphabets  can  be  made,  and,  since  they  are  all  based 
on  the  primary  alphabet  of  the  rotor,  they  will  form  a 26  x 26  tableau  with  a 
single  mixed  alphabet  shifting  one  space  forward  in  each  successive  line.  If  the 
machine  is  so  constructed  as  to  nudge  the  rotor  forward  one  space  each  time 
a letter  is  enciphered,  the  result  will  be  the  same  as  using  the  tableau  line 
after  line,  from  top  to  bottom,  and  then  repeating.  This  constitutes,  of  course, 
nothing  more  than  a progressive-key  polyalphabetic  substitution  with  a mixed 
alphabet  and  a period  of  26. 

This  is  likewise  not  worth  the  expense  of  a machine.  If,  however,  a second 
rotor  be  added  by  the  side  of  the  first,  a great  stride  is  taken.  Two  successive 
encipherments  are  produced.  If  the  rotors  move  together,  the  result  will  still 
be  a mixed-alphabet  polyalphabetic  with  a period  of  26,  though  with  a tableau 
that  represents  their  combined  encipherments.  But  if  the  second  rotor  shifts  a 
space  only  after  the  first  rotor  has  completed  its  revolution,  the  change  will 
vary  the  total  encipherment:  for  though  the  first  rotor  is  back  in  its  original 
position  with  regard  to  the  fixed  plates,  the  second  has  moved.  This  new 
displacement  brings  into  play  a new  cipher  alphabet,  the  27th.  Each  new 
variation  in  position  between  the  two  rotors  and  the  plates  creates  a new 
alphabet.  If  the  machine  is  so  constructed  that  the  second  rotor  moves  forward 
a space  only  as  the  first  is  returning  to  its  starting  point,  then  it  will  take  26 
revolutions  of  the  first  rotor  to  drive  the  second  through  one  full  revolution 
so  that  both  return  to  their  original  stations.  Since  the  second  rotor  assumes 
26  positions,  and  the  first  rotor  assumes  26  positions  for  each  one  of  the 
second  rotor’s,  the  two  combined  assume  26  x 26,  or  676,  different  positions 
with  regard  to  the  fixed  plates. 

Each  of  these  676  different  positions  produces  a different  wire  maze  inside 
the  pair  of  rotors,  and  each  different  maze  means  a different  ciphertext 
alphabet.  For  imagine  that  both  rotors  are  held  steady  in  one  position  while 
each  letter  from  a to  z is  tapped  out  on  the  keyboard.  The  bulbs  that  light  up 
comprise  the  ciphertext  equivalents  for  these  letters,  and  those  ciphertext 
equivalents  taken  as  a whole  comprise  the  ciphertext  alphabet  representing 
that  particular  maze.  Let  one  rotor  turn  one  space  and  the  process  be  repeated, 
begetting  another  ciphertext  alphabet.  These  two  alphabets  are  brothers 
under  the  skin  but  superficially  they  differ.  The  substitute  for  e may  be  x in 
one  and  z in  the  other.  Consequently,  the  two-rotor  machine  produces  a 
polyalphabetic  substitution  with  a period  of  676. 

The  addition  of  a third  rotor  multiplies  that  figure  by  26,  since  all  three 
rotors  will  not  return  to  their  starting  position  for  26x26x26,  or  17,576, 
successive  encipherments.  Fourth  and  fifth  rotors  result  in  periods  of  456,976 
and  11,881,376  letters,  respectively. 


413

Each  of  those  letters,  moreover,  is  enciphered  with  a different  ciphertext 
alphabet.  In  that  lies  the  strength  of  the  rotor  system.  The  case  differs  from 
one  in  which  an  11,881,376-character  Vernam  tape  keys  a message.  The 
period  is  the  same  in  both  cases,  but  the  Vernam  employs  only  32  different 
alphabets.  Secrecy  resides  in  the  nonpattern  in  which  they  serve.  Rotors, 
however,  unfailingly  turn  one  space  per  letter  (barring  gears  to  vary  this),  and 
consequently  its  alphabets  succeed  one  another  in  the  most  rigid  order,  whose 
predictability  hardly  adds  to  the  system's  security.  When  all  have  been  used 
the  sequence  repeats.  This  is  a progressive-key  system  and,  considering  that  it 
was  originated  by  the  Abbot  Trithemius,  it  is  hardly  new.  But  the  rotor  device 
carries  the  process  to  such  astronomical  lengths  that  a difference  in  degree 
becomes  a difference  in  kind.  The  special  merit  of  the  rotor  system  springs 
from  its  outpouring  of  cipher  alphabets  in  such  hemorrhaging  profusion  as  to 
provide  a different  alphabet  for  each  letter  in  a plaintext  longer  by  far  than  the 
complete  works  of  Shakespeare,  War  and  Peace,  the  Iliad,  the  Odyssey,  Don 
Quixote,  the  Canterbury  Tales,  and  Paradise  Lost  all  put  together. 

A period  of  that  length  thwarts  any  practical  possibility  of  a straight- 
forward solution  on  the  basis  of  letter  frequency.  This  general  solution  would 
need  about  50  letters  per  cipher  alphabet,  meaning  that  all  five  rotors  would 
have  to  go  through  their  combined  cycle  50  times.  The  cryptogram  would 
have  to  be  as  long  as  all  the  speeches  made  on  the  floor  of  the  Senate  and  the 
House  of  Representatives  in  three  successive  sessions  of  Congress.  No  crypt- 
analyst is  likely  to  bag  that  kind  of  trophy  in  his  lifetime;  even  diplomats,  who 
can  be  as  verbose  as  politicians,  rarely  scale  those  heights  of  loquacity. 

Consequently  the  cryptanalyst  must  fall  back  on  special  cases.  They 
furnish  him  with  what  he  must  have  for  a practicable  rotor  solution : the  plain- 
text for  a length  of  ciphertext.  He  can  get  this  in  several  ways.  A Kerckhoffs 
superimposition  is  possible  when  several  messages  begin  at  the  same  rotor 
setting,  or  with  settings  so  close  to  one  another  that  the  cipher-alphabet 
sequence  overlaps  among  messages.  The  kappa  test  will  reveal  these.  Sometimes 
two  cryptograms  have  the  same  plaintext:  one  was  sent  in  the  wrong  key,  or 
identical  orders  are  being  sent  to  several  units.  Probable  words  or  stereotyped 
beginnings  will  sometimes  provide  good  clues.  And  sometimes  the  plaintext 
itself  becomes  available,  through  wireless  queries,  a cipher  clerk’s  carelessness, 
published  diplomatic  notes,  and  the  like.  All  of  these  situations  have  occurred 
often  enough  for  the  cryptanalyst  to  exploit  them. 

That  exploitation  entails  resolving  the  millions  of  secondary  alphabets 
into  the  few  primary  ones.  It  calls  upon  the  resources  of  higher  mathematics, 
especially  group  theory,  whose  techniques  are  particularly  suited  to  handle  the 
many  unknowns  involved  in  a rotor  solution.  Basically  these  unknowns  are  the 
paths  taken  by  the  wires  of  each  rotor  from  one  face  to  the  other.  The  crypt- 
analyst-mathematician  quantifies  them  by  measuring  the  distance,  or  displace- 
ment, between  the  input  and  the  output  contacts.  For  example,  a wire  from 
input  contact  3 to  output  contact  10  marks  a displacement  of  7.  Similarly,

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


letters  are  given  numerical  values,  usually  a = 0,  b = 1,  ...  z = 25.  Using 
his  known  or  assumed  plaintext  values,  the  cryptanalyst  sets  up  equations  in 
which  the  displacements  of  the  several  rotors  constitute  the  unknowns,  and 
then  solves  the  equations  for  them. 

For  example,  the  cryptanalyst  may  find  two  identical  ciphertext  letters  in 
the  first  26  letters  of  the  cryptogram.  Only  the  first  rotor  is  turning;  the  last 
four  have  not  moved.  Since  the  two  electrical  impulses  emerged  at  the  same 
ciphertext  lamp,  they  had  to  trace  the  same  course  through  the  maze  of  the 
last  four  rotors.  Their  paths  differed  only  in  the  first  rotor.  The  cryptanalyst 
can  set  up  two  equations.  In  each,  the  ciphertext’s  numerical  value  equals  the 
known  plaintext  value  plus  the  unknown  displacement  on  the  first  rotor  plus 
the  unknown  displacement  on  the  last  four  together.  He  takes  into  account  by 
a correction  the  first  rotor’s  having  turned  several  spaces.  He  subtracts  one 
equation  from  the  other  in  the  standard  algebraic  process  for  solving  simul- 
taneous equations.  This  will  reduce  the  substitutive  effect  of  the  last  four 
rotors  to  zero.  It  will  also  give  the  cryptanalyst  a numerical  value  that  equals 
the  difference  between  the  two  displacements  in  the  first  rotor.  By  repeating 
this  process,  the  cryptanalyst  can  list  the  differences  between  many  of  the 
displacements  on  the  rotor.  He  can  then  seek  an  arrangement  of  wires  having 
these  differences  that  will  reproduce  the  known  cryptographic  effects. 

In  similar  fashion,  he  will  reconstruct  another  rotor.  To  isolate  it,  he  must 
neutralize  the  movement  of  its  fellows.  Thus  the  first  rotor  will  return  to  its 
original  position  at  the  1st,  27th,  53rd,  79th,  and  so  on,  letters  of  the  crypto- 
gram. The  second  rotor  remains  in  its  first  position  for  the  first  26  letters  of 
the  cryptogram,  in  its  second  position  for  the  second  26,  and  so  on,  not 
resuming  its  starting  position  until  the  677th  letter,  when  it  again  remains 
fixed  for  26  letters.  The  other  rotors  likewise  stand  and  turn  in  their  own 
rhythms.  By  selecting  letters  at  the  proper  intervals,  the  cryptanalyst  can 
“stop”  the  revolution  of  a rotor  much  as  stroboscopic  flashes  do. 

Such  are  the  basic  principles  of  the  rotor  solution.  But  their  practice  wracks 
the  cryptanalyst  with  some  of  the  most  excruciating  mental  torture  known  to 
man.  The  equations  seem  to  stretch  from  here  to  the  moon  and  to  involute  their 
parts  as  confusingly  as  the  Gordian  knot.  In  part,  this  complexity  results  from 
the  need  to  index  all  displacements  against  the  fixed  input  and  output  plates, 
which,  after  all,  represent  the  plain-  and  ciphertext  components,  and  the  con- 
sequent continual  corrections  that  must  be  made.  In  part,  it  results  from  the 
frequent  necessity  of  expressing  one  displacement  difference  in  terms  of  several 
others.  A difference  on  the  third  rotor  may  only  be  known  as  the  sum  of 
differences  on  the  first  and  fourth  rotors,  and  the  difference  on  the  fourth  may, 
in  turn,  be  known  only  as  the  sum  of  differences  on  the  second  and  fifth. 
Thus  one  unknown  may  be  represented  by  four  or  five  terms.  Group  theory 
is  particularly  fitted  to  handle  this  sort  of  problem,  but  it  is  also  peculiarly 
prone  to  error.  A false  assumption  will  spread  and  grow  like  a malignant 
fungus  over  the  treelike  branches  of  these  equations.  Finally,  the  pattern  of 


415 


Secrecy  for  Sale 

displacements  that  the  cryptanalyst  reconstructs  may  be  correct  only  in  a 
relative  sense  and  may  require  permutation  to  the  absolute  form.  These 
inherent  problems  are  aggravated  by  external  ones.  The  enemy  cryptographers 
seldom  oblige  by  beginning  all  their  messages  with  the  rotors  in  their  starting 
position.  The  cryptanalyst  is  forced  to  determine  first  when  the  several  rotors 
change  positions.  This  problem,  in  turn,  is  made  more  difficult  by  the  use  of 
devices  that  impart  an  irregular  movement  to  the  rotors.  Furthermore,  the 
cryptographer  can  alter  his  substitution  just  by  changing  the  order  of  the 
rotors. 

All  in  all,  the  rotor  system  produces  an  extremely  complex  and  secure 
cipher  from  simple  elements  in  a simple  construction.  Who  are  the  four 
contrivers  of  this  miniature  labyrinth,  the  four  modern  Daedaluses  of  crypto- 
graphy? 

The  inventor  of  the  first  machine  to  embody  the  rotor  principle  gave  the 
best  efforts  of  his  life  to  it.  Edward  Hugh  Hebern  was  born  April  23,  1869,  in 
Streator,  Illinois,  and  was  raised  in  the  Soldiers’  Orphan  Home  in  Blooming- 
ton. When  he  was  14  he  began  living  and  working  on  a farm  near  Odin,  where 
he  got  a high  school  education.  He  headed  West  at  19,  and,  after  selling  a 
timber  claim  in  California  to  a sawmill  where  he  worked  for  a time,  he  turned 
to  carpentry  and  built  and  sold  houses  in  Fresno.  Soon  after  he  turned  40, 
he  somehow  became  interested  in  cryptology.  Hebern  was  at  this  time  a blue- 
eyed, brown-haired  man  of  medium  height  and  build,  mustachioed,  quiet,  a 
great  reader,  kind,  and  even-tempered. 

From  1912  to  1915,  he  filed  for  patents  for  cryptographic  check-writing 
devices,  cipher  keyboards  for  typewriters,  movable  letter  blocks  to  form  mixed 
reciprocal  monalphabets,  and  a ciphering  typewriter.  In  1915,  he  devised  an 
arrangement  in  which  two  electric  typewriters  were  connected  by  26  wires  in 
random  fashion;  thus  when  a letter  was  struck  on  the  plaintext  keyboard,  it 
would  cause  a ciphertext  letter  to  print  on  the  other  machine.  Since  the  wires 
remained  plugged  into  the  same  jacks  during  an  entire  message,  the  crypto- 
gram would  be  mon alphabetic — but  it  would  have  been  electromechanically 
enciphered. 

The  wire  interconnections  comprised  the  germ  of  the  rotor — a means  to 
vary  the  mon  alphabetic  encipherment.  In  1917,  Hebern  reduced  his  ideas  to 
the  first  drawings  made  of  a rotor  system,  which,  a year  later,  grew  into  actual 
apparatus. 

Early  in  1921,  he  advertised  an  “unbreakable”  cipher  in  a marine  maga- 
zine, but  Miss  Agnes  Meyer,  a cryptanalyst  in  the  Navy’s  Code  and  Signal 
Section,  solved  the  sample  message.  When  Commander  Milo  F.  Draemel,  the 
officer  in  charge,  sent  Hebern  the  solution,  he  came  at  once  to  Washington 
and  showed  the  Navy  his  machine,  filing  his  first  rotor  patent  while  he  was 
there.  The  Navy  had  been  looking,  a director  of  naval  communications 
later  recalled,  for  “something  radically  better  [in  secret  communications].

Something  automatic  came  into  our  minds,  and  it  had  been  in  the  back 
of  our  heads  for  some  time.  Along  came  Mr.  Hebern  from  the  West  Coast 
with  the  Hebern  machine.  He  made  one,  as  I recall,  and  we  were  very  thrilled 
when  he  showed  us  what  it  could  do.  ...  I remember  we  wanted  to  get 
some  right  away  for  the  whole  Navy.” 

Hebern  had,  in  1921,  incorporated  Hebern  Electric  Code,  the  first  cipher 
machine  company  in  the  U.S.,  and  with  this  kind  of  encouragement  from  the 
Navy,  and  believing — rightly — that  his  new  rotor  device  was  the  cipher 
machine  of  the  future,  he  began  selling  shares  in  his  firm  to  raise  capital.  Since 
it  controlled  scores  of  patents  in  the  United  States  and  abroad,  not  only  on 
the  cipher  machine  but  on  such  other  pioneering  devices  as  electric  typewriters 
and  directional  indicators  for  cars,  he  had  no  trouble  selling  about  $1,000,000 
worth  of  stock  to  2,500  shareholders,  mostly  from  Oakland,  where  he  then 
lived. 

On  February  5,  1922,  Hebern  bought  a machine  works  to  help  his  produc- 
tion facilities  make  cipher  machine  dies,  molds,  and  patterns.  Then,  thinking 
that  “we  are  very  close  to  a great  financial  success  with  our  code  inventions 
and  that  it  is  sensible  to  be  prepared  to  take  care  of  a big  business  in  a 
permanent  way,”  he  decided  to  erect  a plant  large  enough  to  house  a 1,500- 
man  factory.  A steam  shovel,  with  Hebern  at  the  controls,  broke  ground  on 
September  21  for  a three-story  neo-Gothic  building  occupying  half  a square 
block  on  the  west  side  of  Harrison  Street  between  Eighth  and  Ninth  Streets  in 
Oakland.  Plans  called  for  a buffing-and-polishing  room,  a plating  room,  a 
200-foot-long  assembly  room,  a tool-and-die  room,  and  numerous  other 
facilities,  including  a corner  office  with  fireplace  for  the  president.  In  February 
of  1923,  he  hired  Agnes  Meyer  (by  now  Mrs.  Driscoll)  for  cryptologic  help 
and  liaison  with  the  Navy. 

While  the  building  was  going  up,  Hebern  sold  more  stock  in  the  company 
(“Remember,  your  stock  is  participating  stock,  and  has  the  same  chance  to 
advance  as  the  original  stock  of  the  telephone,  wireless  and  other  great 
inventions”),  inundated  his  stockholders  with  optimistic  reports,  and  kept  his 
offices  open  until  9 p.m.  every  night,  including  Sundays,  so  that  stockholders 
could  examine  the  wonderful  device.  His  handiwork  filled  Hebern  with  such 
awe  that  he  extolled  it  in  what  may  be  the  first  ode  to  a cipher  machine: 


Marvelous  invention  comes  out  of  the  West

Overlooking  this,  the  Chief  of  Naval  Operations  convened  a board  in 
1923  to  look  into  the  Hebern  machine.  On  it  were  Commander  R.  E.  Inger- 
soll,  later  Commander  in  Chief  Atlantic  Fleet,  Commander  Russell  Willson, 
and  Lieutenant  Commander  W.  W.  Smith.  It  recommended  the  machine’s 
adoption  when  perfected,  and  when  the  Secretary  of  the  Navy  approved  the 
report,  the  Navy  felt  committed  to  the  Hebern  machine.  None  of  this,  how- 
ever, had  resulted  in  any  cash  sales  by  the  time  the  grandiose  factory  was 
completed  late  in  1923  at  a cost  of  $380,000 — half  again  as  much  as  the 
original  $250,000  estimate.  This  lack  of  income  made  it  impossible  for  Hebern 
to  bear  the  burden  of  its  overhead,  and,  in  the  spring  of  1924,  the  firm  de- 
faulted on  the  interest  on  its  $100,000  mortgage.  In  the  subsequent  reorganiza- 
tion, Hebern  was  removed  as  president,  though  he  remained  in  control.  On 
April  30,  an  angry  group  of  stockholders,  at  a stormy  meeting  that  attracted 
newspaper  coverage,  protested  a 10  per  cent  assessment  levied  by  the  firm  to 
pay  the  interest.  They  prompted  a state  investigation  into  charges  that 
Hebern  had  sold  stock  in  the  firm  at  $3  and  $5  a share  instead  of  at  the 
legally  authorized  $1  par  value.  In  the  summer  Mrs.  Driscoll  returned  to  the 
Navy  Department. 

The  investigation — largely  under  Alameda  County  District  Attorney  Earl 
Warren,  later  Chief  Justice  of  the  United  States — continued  through  1924  and 
1925  and  into  1926.  During  that  time  the  U.S.  Navy  ordered  two  Hebern 
machines  at  $600  each,  and  the  Army  paid  him  $500  for  two  that  he  had 
already  delivered.  The  Pacific  Steamship  Company  bought  seven  at  $120  (the 
difference  in  price  was  due  to  the  variation  in  the  number  of  rotors  in  the 
machines  offered  for  sale)  for  use  aboard  four  ships  and  in  three  shore 
offices.  The  Italian  government  purchased  a machine,  and  Britain’s  Admiralty 
was  studying  one. 

But  shareholder  pressure  was  mounting.  Only  twelve  machines  had  been 
sold,  they  complained.  As  many  as  500  stockholders  thronged  the  protest 
meetings,  and  150  crowded  the  Oakland  Police  Court  at  preliminary  hearings 


419 


Secrecy  for  Sale 

of  Hebern’s  case,  which  attracted  considerable  public  notice.  Hebern  was 
finally  brought  to  trial  March  1,  1926,  in  the  Superior  Court  on  a charge  of 
violating  California’s  corporate  securities  act.  After  four  days — during  which 
such  witnesses  as  74-year-old  Mrs.  Caroline  Gowdy  testified  how  she  had 
purchased  200  shares  at  $5  apiece — the  jury  retired.  Twelve  minutes  later  it 
returned,  having  found  Hebern  guilty.  Though  this  verdict  was  later  set  aside 
and  the  charge  dismissed  for  lack  of  evidence,  it  killed  Hebern’s  chances  of 
attracting  large  amounts  of  capital.  Three  months  later,  Hebern  Electric 
Code,  Inc.,  went  into  bankruptcy. 

Hebern  refused  to  give  up.  Pinning  his  hopes  on  the  Navy,  he  incorporated 
the  International  Code  Machine  Company  in  Reno,  Nevada.  Things  started 
to  look  up  in  1928  when  he  sold  four  five-rotor  machines  to  the  Navy  at  $750 
for  each  machine  and  $20  for  each  rotor.  Hebern  and  a handful  of  employees 
had  built  them  by  hand,  and  he  himself  then  drove  them  to  the  12th  Naval 
District  Office  in  San  Francisco.  One  machine  stayed  there ; the  others  were 
sent  to  the  Navy  Department  and  to  the  commanders  in  chief  of  the  United 
States  Fleet  and  the  Battle  Fleet  for  field  tests.  The  Navy  wanted  to  determine 
their  mechanical  reliability  rather  than  their  cryptographic  capabilities,  which 
were  regarded  as  satisfactory,  even  though  Friedman  had  made  a crypt- 
analytic  breakthrough  and  solved  the  first  rotor  system.  During  1929  and 
1930  these  machines  handled  a considerable  portion  of  the  Navy's  official 
high-command  communications.  Things  looked  even  better  for  Hebern  in 
1931,  when  the  Navy  purchased  31  machines  for  $54,480.  These  were  not 
experimental  machines,  but  were  issued  to  the  more  important  flag  officers  as 
the  top  cryptographic  system  in  the  United  States  Navy.  In  1934,  Hebern, 
who  was  continually  trying  to  improve  his  machines,  submitted  one  that 
proved  a complete  failure.  The  officer  who  had  dealt  most  with  him,  Safford, 
was  on  sea  duty,  and  some  Navy  man  who  did  not  know  Hebern  sent  him  an 
abrupt  and  discourteous  letter,  discontinuing  business  with  him.  As  Safford 
later  put  it,  “They  pulled  the  rug  out  from  under  Hebern  and  were  not  even 
polite  about  it.” 

That  virtually  ended  Hebern’s  chances,  for  although  his  machines  were 
still  in  service,  when  they  wore  out  in  1936  after  carrying  heavy  loads  of 
traffic  they  were  replaced  by  another,  non-Hebern  cryptographic  system. 
Interestingly,  the  Hebern  machines  themselves  were  renovated  and  sent  to 
shore  stations,  where  some  remained  in  use  until  1942.  Two  were,  in  fact, 
captured  by  the  Japanese  during  World  War  II. 

During  this  time,  Hebern  was  living  on  income  from  properties  left  by 
his  wife’s  sister.  He  continued  to  improve  his  machines  and  to  take  out 
patents,  despite  the  setback  of  losing  a patent  interference  case  against 
International  Business  Machines  in  1941.  In  1947,  convinced  that  the  armed 
forces  had  used  his  basic  ideas  throughout  the  war  without  compensating 
him  for  them,  he  filed  a claim  of  $50,000,000  against  the  three  services.  In  the 
six-year  period  that  this  remained  entangled  in  bureaucratic  red  tape,  Hebern 


420  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

died.  He  was  82,  and  had  suffered  a heart  attack  on  February  10,  1952,  while 
trying  to  lift  a box  that  was  too  heavy  for  him. 

Early  in  1953,  the  departments  of  the  Army,  Navy,  and  Air  Force 
rejected  his  claims,  and  a few  months  later  his  estate  sued  the  government  for 
the  $50,000,000.  On  the  basis  of  legal  technicalities,  the  United  States  Court 
of  Claims  limited  the  period  of  recovery  to  1947-1953  and  the  infringement 
question  to  the  exceedingly  narrow  one  of  a particular  dog  arrangement  for 
turning  the  rotors.  Ignored  was  the  basic  question  of  whether  the  armed 
forces  had  adopted  the  rotor  principle  from  Hebern  and  used  it  without  just 
compensation  in  hundreds  of  thousands  of  high-security  machines  in  World 
War  II  and  in  the  cold  war — which  they  had  unquestionably  done.  Ignored 
were  the  ethics  of  having  obtained  Hebern’s  best  developmental  efforts  on  the 
implied  promise  of  large  production  contracts,  which  were  awarded  instead 
to  the  Teletype  Corporation. 

The  government,  taking  refuge  from  the  spirit  of  justice  in  the  letter  of  the 
law,  fought  to  keep  from  giving  him  a penny.  In  1958,  it  finally  settled  for  the 
pittance  of  $30,000 — and  not  out  of  a sense  of  fair  play,  but  because  it  feared 
that  the  court’s  sense  of  right  would  compel  it  to  bare  some  cryptographic 
secrets.  The  payment  was  disproportionate  to  Hebern’s  contribution,  which 
was  worth,  not  $50,000,000,  to  be  sure,  but  $1,000,000  at  the  least.  Hebern 
deserved  better.  His  story,  tragic,  unjust,  and  pathetic,  does  his  country  no 
honor. 

At  2:55  p.m.,  Tuesday,  October  7,  1919,  the  man  who  viewed  the  rotor 
most  comprehensively  filed  what  was  to  become  Netherlands  patent  No. 
10,700  for  a “Geheimschrijfmachine”  (“secret  writing  machine”).  Hugo 
Alexander  Koch,  then  49,  a native  of  Delft,  had  apparently  devised  it  as  an 
outgrowth  of  his  engineering  hobbies.  He  foresaw  some  commercial  value 
for  the  system,  for  he  set  up  a corporation,  the  Naamlooze  Venootschap 
Ingenieursbureau  “Securitas,”  in  whose  name  the  patent  was  issued.  Koch 
pointed  out  in  this  patent  that  steel  wires  on  pulleys,  levers,  rays  of  light, 
or  air,  water,  or  oil  flowing  through  tubes  could  transmit  the  enciphering 
impulse  as  well  as  electricity  did.  He  also  observed  that  this  impulse  did  not 
have  to  flow  through  a rotor,  but  could  move  through  tubes  drilled  through 
bars  that  slid  between  plates,  or  from  an  interior  disk  to  a circumjacent  ring. 
He  favored  the  rotor  mechanism,  but  no  machine  ensued  in  any  of  the  forms. 
In  1927,  he  assigned  the  patent  rights  to  the  German  inventor  of  a rotor  device, 
and  the  following  year  he  died  in  Diisseldorf. 

The  German  was  Arthur  Scherbius.  Little  more  is  known  of  him  than  that 
he  was  an  engineer,  had  a doctorate,  held  a number  of  patents  involving  such 
far-from-cryptologic  materials  as  ceramics,  and  lived  in  Wilmersdorf,  a 
suburb  of  Berlin.  His  first  cryptologic  device  enciphered  codenumbers  into 
pronounceable  codewords,  which  were  then  favored  by  international  tele- 
graph conventions.  It  did  this  by  feeding  the  placode  numbers  alternately  to 


421

vowel  and  consonant  encicode  equivalents.  The  device  included  “multiple 
switch  boards  which  connect  each  arriving  lead  with  one  of  the  outgoing  leads 
and  which  are  adapted  to  interchange  this  connection  with  great  facility  of 
variation."  Though  Scherbius  did  not  describe  this  device  further,  it  was  the 
basis  of  a rotor  system.  Such  appeared  full-blown  in  his  next  patent.  The 
rotors  served  only  for  numeral  encipherment  in  this  device,  but  in  subsequent 
ones  they  expanded  their  contacts  from  10  to  26  and  so  could  be  used  for 
standard  literal  encipherment. 

He  called  his  machine  the  Enigma.  Model  a,  a monster  about  the  size  and 
shape  of  a cash  register,  was  soon  discarded  for  Model  b,  which  stuck  the 
enciphering  mechanism  on  the  right  side  of  an  ordinary  typewriter.  Model  c 
was  a portable,  nonprinting  device  in  which  the  letters  were  indicated— as  in 
the  early  Hebern  models — by  lamps.  All  models  had  typewriterlike  keyboards. 
The  Enigma  differed  in  two  important  ways  from  the  other  rotor  conceptions. 
Its  final  rotor  was  a half-rotor:  it  had  contacts  on  one  face  only  and  these 
were  interconnected.  An  impulse  coming  to  this  rotor  would  thus  be  reflected 
back  through  the  rotors  through  which  it  had  just  come.  This  doubly  en- 
ciphered each  letter,  but  it  also  made  the  encipherment  reciprocal  (if  plaintext 
e became  x,  then  plaintext  x had  to  become  ciphertext  e),  which  is  a weakness. 
The  second  difference  was  that  the  rotor  progression  was  governed  by  gears 
to  make  it  irregular.  Unfortunately,  the  gears  had  so  low  a pitch  that  their 
period  came  to  only  53,295  letters.  Later  machines  improved  this. 

Scherbius  seems  to  have  formed  a little  company  of  his  own,  Gewerkschaft 
Securitas,  to  promote  his  machine.  Evidently  some  businessmen  saw  pos- 
sibilities in  the  mechanism,  for  in  July  of  1923  a corporation  was  set  up  to 
manufacture  and  sell  it.  Chiffriermaschinen  Aktiengesellschaft  (“Cipher 
Machines  Corporation”)  was  capitalized  during  Germany’s  disastrous  post- 
war inflation  at  500,000,000  marks,  distributed  in  50,000  shares  of  10,000 
marks  par  value.  It  paid  Gewerkschaft  Securitas  300,000,000  marks  for  a 
controlling  share  of  the  company  and  its  patents,  models,  drawings,  and 
tools.  Scherbius  sat  on  the  six-man  board  of  directors. 

Chiffriermaschinen  Aktiengesellschaft  began  operating  on  August  24, 
1923,  at  2 Steglitzerstrasse,  Berlin,  and  worked  hard  to  create  a demand  for 
its  product.  It  exhibited  the  Enigma  before  the  1923  congress  of  the  Inter- 
national Postal  Union,  and  the  following  year  got  the  German  post  office  to 
exchange  Enigma-enciphered  greetings  with  the  congress.  It  got  some  publi- 
city in  Radio  News  and  extensive  coverage  in  a book  on  cipher  machines  by 
Dr.  Siegfried  Tiirkel,  scientific  director  of  the  Criminological  Institute  of  the 
Vienna  police.  It  printed  flyers  in  German  and  illustrated  brochures  in 
English:  “The  natural  inquisitiveness  of  competitors  is  at  once  checkmated 
by  a machine  which  enables  you  to  keep  all  your  documents,  or  at  least  their 
important  parts,  entirely  secret  without  occasioning  any  expenses  worth 
mentioning.  One  secret,  well  protected,  may  pay  the  whole  cost  of  the 
machine.  . . .”

But  nothing  helped.  A few  machines  were  bought  for  study  purposes  by 
the  armed  forces  of  various  nations  and  communications  companies,  but 
mass  sales  never  materialized.  Production  constantly  declined.  In  1924,  the 
first  full  year  of  operation,  Chiffriermaschinen  Aktiengesellschaft  spent 
102,812  reichmarks  (the  new  monetary  unit)  for  expenses,  salaries,  and 
wages.  In  1929  it  disbursed  only  56,345.  By  then  Scherbius’  name  was  no 
longer  listed  among  the  directors,  most  probably  because  he  had  died.  After 
ten  full  years  of  operation,  the  firm  had  still  failed  to  pay  a dividend.  So  on 
July  5,  1934,  it  dissolved  and  transferred  its  assets  to  Chiffriermaschinen 
Gesellschaft  Heimsoeth  und  Rinke,  a new  cipher  machine  firm  organized  by 
Dr.  Rudolf  Heimsoeth  and  Frau  Elsbeth  Rinke,  both  directors  of  the  old 
firm. 

Soon  Hitler  began  rearming  Germany,  and  the  cryptologic  experts  of  the 
Wehrmacht,  deciding  that  the  Enigma  offered  satisfactory  guarantees  of 
security,  began  supplying  their  expanding  forces  with  it.  Whether  Heimsoeth 
and  Rinke  enjoyed  this  new  prosperity,  or  whether  the  Nazis  nationalized 
their  business  or  merged  it  into  others,  is  unknown.  During  World  War  II, 
the  portable  glowlamp  Enigma,  battery-powered,  and,  in  its  wooden  box, 
about  the  size  and  weight  of  a standard  typewriter,  served  as  the  top  German 
Army,  Navy,  Air  Force  system.  Signal  officers  regarded  it  as  very  depend- 
able and  believed  it  to  be  secure.  Its  only  disadvantage  was  that  it  did  not 
print,  and  speedy  operation  required  three  men — one  to  read  the  incoming 
text  and  press  the  keys,  one  to  call  out  the  letters  in  a loud  voice  as  they  lit  up, 
one  to  write  down  the  text. 

Oddly  enough,  the  fuzziest  of  the  four  original  rotor  conceptions  reached 
a patent  office  only  three  days  after  the  clearest.  Koch  had  filed  for  his 
patent  in  Holland  on  a Tuesday,  and  on  Friday  of  that  same  week  in  October, 
1919,  Arvid  Gerhard  Damm  applied  in  Stockholm  for  what  was  to  become 
Swedish  patent  No.  52,279. 

Damm’s  device  employed  a kind  of  double  rotor  arrangement.  Two 
circular  flat  plates,  both  wired  like  rotors,  turned  above  and  below  a hori- 
zontal intermediate  plate.  Gears  moved  the  rotors  an  irregular  number  of 
spaces  at  each  plaintext  letter.  Damm,  however,  regarded  the  rotor  as' only 
an  auxiliary  feature  of  the  enciphering  mechanism,  which  was  so  extra- 
ordinarily clumsy  and  complicated  that  it  seems  never  to  have  been  built. 
And  though  Damm’s  conception  of  the  rotor  accords  him  a listing  in  the 
honor  roll  of  cryptologic  inventors,  his  real  impact  on  cryptology  comes 
from  his  having  established  a cipher  machine  company  that  eventually  became 
the  only  commercially  successful  one  in  the  world. 

Damm  is  one  of  cryptology’s  “characters.”  He  was  originally  a textile 
engineer.  While  engineering  manager  of  a cloth-making  factory  in  Finland,  he 
became  enamored  of  a Hungarian  equestrienne  in  a traveling  circus.  Unable 
to  overcome  her  virtue,  he  had  a chum  dress  up  like  a clergyman  and  “marry”

them  in  a fake  ceremony  in  a chapel,  thus  achieving  his  goal.  He  had  a flair 
for  mechanics,  and  in  his  villa  in  Ronninge,  a suburb  of  Stockholm,  he  had 
chairs  whose  armrests  and  footrests  could  be  adjusted  at  the  touch  of  a 
button,  controls  at  his  desk  that  would  flick  lights  on  and  open  doors,  and 
other  gimmicks  to  astonish  guests. 

He  had  several  inventions  relating  to  the  Jacquard  pattern-weaving  loom 
to  his  credit  when,  just  as  World  War  I was  breaking  out,  he  and  an  English 
cloth  manufacturer,  George  Lorimer  Craig  of  Huddersfield,  filed  three 
applications  for  a cipher  machine  in  the  German  patent  office.  Damm’s 
interest  may  have  been  awakened  by  his  brother,  Ivar,  a mathematics  teacher 
in  the  high  school  at  Gavle,  Sweden,  who  dabbled  in  cryptanalysis.  Damm 
brought  his  machine  to  an  acquaintance  at  the  Swedish  Embassy  in  Berlin, 
who  urged  a meeting  with  his  brother,  Commander  Captain  Olof  Gylden, 
who  was  commandant  of  the  Royal  Naval  School  in  Stockholm  and  took  an 
interest  in  all  kinds  of  new  ideas.  In  1916,  Gylden  and  Damm  were  instru- 
mental in  founding  Aktiebolaget  Cryptograph  (“Cryptograph,  Inc.”).  Among 
the  investors  were  Emanuel  Nobel,  nephew  of  Alfred  Nobel,  inventor  of 
dynamite  and  donor  of  the  Nobel  prizes,  and  K.  W.  Hagelin,  manager  of  the 
Nobel  brothers’  oil  production  company  in  Russia,  a close  friend  of  Emanuel 
and  at  one  time  Swedish  consul-general  in  St.  Petersburg.  In  1921,  the  firm 
had  its  three-room  offices  at  19  Karduansmakaregatan  in  Stockholm.  It 
seemed  to  employ  considerably  more  bosses  than  workers:  excluding  Damm 
himself,  there  were  altogether  a managing  director,  a technical  director,  a 
draftsman,  and  a bookkeeper. 

Damm  designed  quite  a few  machines.  One  included  his  ingenious  “in- 
fluence letter.”  This  was  a plaintext  letter  whose  key  on  the  keyboard  was 
disconnected  from  the  mechanism  that  advanced  the  cipher  elements,  though 
it  itself  was  enciphered;  this  letter  thus  interrupted  that  advance  at  the  wholly 
irregular  intervals  of  its  appearance  in  the  plaintext.  Another  machine 
enciphered  numerical  codegroups  into  pronounceable  codewords  in  which 
vowels  and  consonants  alternated.  The  firm  concentrated  most  on  Damm’s 
Mecano-Cryptographer  Model  a 1,  the  “Cryptotyper,”  an  ugly  apparatus 
that  printed  one  copy  of  the  plaintext  and  two  of  the  ciphertext  (one  to  be 
sent,  one  to  be  filed)  on  three  tapes.  Intercommunicable  with  it  was  the  port- 
able Model  a 2,  which  displayed  the  ciphertext  letter  in  an  aperture.  Their  key 
consisted  of  a chain,  assembled  by  the  user,  some  of  whose  links  moved  the 
so-called  key-body  forward  and  some  backward.  The  Electro-Crypto  Model 
b 1,  handsome  but  massive,  was  later  installed  at  the  main  office  of  Sweden’s 
telegraph  bureau. 

Meanwhile,  Damm  had  fallen  in  love  with  a girl  in  her  early  twenties  whom 
he  had  met  on  the  commuter  train.  He  decided  to  jettison  his  “wife”  in  a 
divorce  proceeding  that  he  thought  would  be  no  more  valid  than  the  marriage 
and,  taking  no  chances,  by  a denunciation  of  her  as  a spy,  to  get  her  out  of  the 
country.  He  was  severely  embarrassed  in  court,  however,  when  his  partner 


425 


Secrecy  for  Sale 

Gylden  revealed  the  phony  wedding  as  well  as  the  spy  gimmick.  Damm 
rewarded  Gylden  for  this  bit  of  candor  by  giving  the  managing  directorship 
to  someone  else  when  it  later  became  available.  But  he  got  what  he  wanted, 
and  his  new  fiancee,  Miss  Spang,  accompanied  him  to  Paris  on  his 
business  trips,  living  with  him  at  the  Hotel  Perigord.  Unfortunately,  this 
saga  ended  sadly  for  him  when  she  jilted  him — doubly  sadly,  since  he 
had  given  her  his  villa,  though  it  was  mortgaged,  as  the  Swedes  say,  to  the 
chimneys. 

Damm  had  won  orders  for  a single  test  Model  b 1 from  several  major 
wireless  companies.  He  hoped  they  would  adopt  it  to  safeguard  the  world  s 
commercial  wireless  traffic.  But  the  machines  proved  erratic.  In  tests  in 
France  in  1925,  sometimes  1,000  letters  could  be  deciphered  correctly,  and 
sometimes  none  at  all.  The  following  year  the  firm  demonstrated  its  machines 
at  The  Hague  for  the  Japanese  military  attache.  Difficulties  abounded.  Direct 
current  was  used  where  alternating  current  was  needed;  parts  were  too 
heavy  to  respond  quickly;  numerous  malfunctions  and  cryptographic  errors 
occurred.  Sales  were  not  spectacular. 

By  then,  however,  a new  personality  was  asserting  himself  in  the  company. 
This  was  Boris  Caesar  Wilhelm  Hagelin,  son  of  the  consul-general  and  investor 
in  the  firm.  Born  on  July  2,  1892,  in  the  Caucasus,  where  his  father  was  work- 
ing, he  studied  for  three  or  four  years  in  St.  Petersburg,  then  returned  to 
Sweden  and  was  graduated  from  the  Royal  Institute  of  Technology  in 
Stockholm  in  1914  with  a degree  in  mechanical  engineering.  After  six  years 
of  working  for  ASEA,  Sweden’s  General  Electric,  and  one  in  the  United  States 
for  the  Standard  Oil  Company  (New  Jersey),  in  the  expectation  of  return- 
ing to  Russia  for  the  Nobel  interests,  he  and  the  Nobels  realized  that  the 
Communist  regime  was  not  going  to  fall  as  they  had  hoped.  Accordingly,  his 
father  and  Emanuel  Nobel  put  him  into  the  Damm  firm  in  1922  to  represent 
their  investment. 

Three  years  later,  while  Damm  was  in  Paris,  young  Hagelin  learned  that 
the  Swedish  military  was  considering  buying  the  Enigma.  He  simplified  one 
of  the  Damm  mechanisms,  giving  it  a keyboard  and  indicating  lamps  like 
the  Enigma’s,  and  making  it  more  suitable  for  field  use.  Its  operation  was 
based  on  the  checkerboard.  It  electrically  altered  the  row  and  column  assign- 
ments to  convert  a plaintext  letter  to  ciphertext.  These  alterations  were 
controlled  by  a group  of  keywheels,  each  with  pins  near  its  rim  that  could  be 
made  active  or  inactive  by  extending  or  retracting  them.  Each  wheel  had  a 
different  number  of  pins.  The  machine  produced  a polyalphabetic  substitu- 
tion whose  period  was  the  product  of  all  the  pin  numbers.  Hagelin  offered 
this  machine,  the  b-21,  to  the  Swedish  Army.  Damm  criticized  it  but  the 
Army  liked  it,  and,  in  1926,  placed  a large  order. 

On  the  verge  of  success,  Damm,  early  in  1927,  died.  Aktiebolaget 
Cryptograph,  which  was  in  poor  financial  shape  but  which  had  a big  order 
in  its  pocket,  was  purchased  at  a good  price  by  the  Hagelin  interests  and 


426 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


reorganized  as  Aktiebolaget  Cryptoteknik,  14  Luntmakaregatan,  Stockholm. 
Boris  Hagelin  ran  the  firm.  He  saw  that  printing  cipher  machines  were  faster, 
more  accurate,  and  more  economical  in  terms  of  manpower  than  indicating 
mechanisms  like  the  Enigma.  He  first  hooked  up  the  Type  b-21  to  an  electric 
typewriter  and  found  it  unacceptably  bulky.  So  he  merged  the  printing 
mechanism  with  the  cryptographic  in  a single  unit,  producing  the  Type  b-21  1. 
It  weighed  37  pounds,  operated  at  200  characters  a minute,  and  could  be 
carried  inside  a case  about  the  size  of  an  attache  case. 

This  was  the  most  compact  printing  cipher  machine  available  in  1 934,  when 
the  French  general  staff  asked  Hagelin  for  the  impossible:  a pocket-sized 
cipher  machine  that  would  print  the  ciphertext  and  so  permit  one-man 
operation.  He  first  whittled  a piece  of  wood  that  would  fit  into  a pocket  to 
mark  the  limits  of  his  dimension.  While  trying  to  concoct  a mechanism  that 
would  fit  inside  such  space  and  also  produce  an  effective  cipher,  he  bethought 
himself  one  day  of  a construction  that  he  had  conceived  three  years  before  for 
the  inventors  of  a vending  machine.  It  was  an  adding  device  that  would 
accept  different  amounts  of  money,  and  it  consisted  of  bars  arranged  in  a 
cylindrical  cage  with  lugs  projecting  from  them  in  rows.  There  were  10  lugs 
in  one  row,  8 in  the  second,  4 in  the  third,  2 in  the  next,  and  1 in  the  last;  by 
combining  these  rows  in  various  ways  any  number  from  1 to  25  could  be 
produced.  This  was  just  what  he  needed.  The  inventors  had  given  him  the 
rights  to  it  when  they  could  not  pay  for  the  prototype  that  he  fabricated.  He 
now  adapted  it  so  that  the  rows  would  shift  a cipher  alphabet  to  any  one  of 
25  positions,  thus  giving  a plaintext  letter  any  one  of  25  ciphertext  equivalents. 
And  to  produce  the  combinations  of  numbers  for  these  shifts,  he  could 
employ  the  keywheels  with  the  variable  number  of  projecting  pins  that  he  had 
used  in  his  b-21  . 

Hagelin  shrank  the  device  to  6 x 4^  x 2 inches — smaller  than  the  base  of  a 
standard  telephone  set — and  to  under  three  pounds,  or  about  the  weight  of  a 
dictionary-sized  codebook.  To  operate  it,  the  encipherer,  after  first  setting  the 
key  elements,  twirled  a knob  at  the  left  to  the  plaintext  letter,  and  revolved  a 
handle  at  the  right.  The  mechanism  spun,  and  a little  typewheel  printed  the 
output  on  a gummed  tape.  Hagelin  even  managed  to  have  it  print  the 
ciphertext  in  five-letter  groups  and  the  plaintext  in  normal  word-lengths 
(by  using  a rare  letter  as  a word-spacer).  Its  speed  averaged  25  letters  per 
minute. 

This  was  the  Type  c-36,  and  when  the  French  saw  it,  they  snapped  it  up. 
Their  1935  order  for  5,000  machines  proved  the  turning  point  in  the  firm’s 
fortunes.  Looking  back,  Hagelin  realized  that  Damm  and  the  other  cipher 
machine  companies  had  not  failed  because  of  any  intrinsic  flaws  in  their 
machines,  but  only  because  the  time  was  not  ripe  for  them  in  the  1920s.  Not 
until  the  war-weariness  of  that  decade  had  worn  off  and  the  rearmament  of 
the  1930s  had  begun  did  a substantial  market  appear.  In  1936,  Yves  Gylden, 
the  son  of  Damm’s  early  partner,  analyzed  the  machine’s  cipher  and 


Secrecy  for  Sale  427 

recommended  some  important  improvements,  which  Hagelin  adopted, 
substantially  strengthening  its  cipher. 

That  same  year,  Hagelin  began  corresponding  with  American  cryptologic 
authorities  about  the  c-36.  He  went  over  himself  in  1937,  and  again  in  1939 
when  war  broke  out  in  Europe.  Now  the  United  States  was  considerably  more 
interested.  Friedman  suggested  improvements,  and  Hagelin  returned  to 
Sweden  to  incorporate  them  and  to  streamline  the  machine  for  mass  produc- 
tion. On  April  9,  1940,  he  was  in  his  cabin  in  Dalecarlia  when  he  heard  a radio 
announcement  that  the  Germans  had  invaded  Norway.  His  wife  told  him  that 
if  he  wanted  to  do  anything  with  his  machine  in  the  United  States,  he  ought  to 
go  there  at  once. 

“A  normal  visa  was  unobtainable,”  he  has  recalled,  “so  I induced  the 
Swedish  foreign  office  to  send  me  as  a diplomatic  courier.  My  wife  and  I sent 
our  luggage  off  in  advance  and  took  the  train  up  to  Stockholm.  There  we 
learned  that  the  travel  bureau  had  cancelled  all  trips  to  the  United  States,  as 
the  Germans  had  by  now  invaded  France,  Holland,  and  Belgium.  We  decided 
to  take  a chance  and  try  to  sail  from  Italy. 

“With  the  blueprints  in  my  briefcase  and  two  dismantled  ciphering 
machines  in  a bag,  we  boarded  the  Trelleborg-Sassnitz-Berlin  express.  Our 
luck  held.  We  rattled  right  through  the  heart  of  Germany  and  arrived  un- 
molested three  days  later  in  Genoa.  That  night  the  windows  of  our  hotel  were 
smashed — because  we  had  innocently  chosen  to  stay  at  the  Hotel  Londra  and 
Italy  was  now  at  war  with  Britain.  But  we  reached  New  York  on  the  last 
outward-bound  voyage  of  the  Conte  di  Savoia .” 

This  breathless  escape  proved  worth  it.  The  U.S.  Army  liked  the  machine, 
though  it  insisted  on  further  tests.  Hagelin  got  50  machines  flown  out  secretly 
from  Stockholm  to  Washington  for  final  exhaustive  trials.  They  passed,  and 
after  long  contract  negotiations,  the  Army  accepted  the  improved  device  as 
its  medium-level  cryptographic  system.  Under  the  U.S.  military  designation 
of  Converter  m-209,  the  Hagelin  machine  served  in  military  units  from  divi- 
sions down  to  battalions.  In  1942,  L.  C.  Smith  & Corona  Typewriters,  Inc., 
began  turning  out  about  400  olive-drab  Hagelin  machines  a day  (compared  to 
its  output  of  about  600  typewriters  a day)  in  its  900-man  factory  at  Groton, 
New  York.  More  than  140,000  were  produced.  (Ironically,  the  Italian  Navy 
also  used  it.)  Hagelin’s  royalties  ran  into  the  millions  of  dollars.  He  became 
the  first — and  the  only — man  to  become  a millionaire  from  cryptology. 

What  is  this  little  jewel  of  a cipher  machine  like?  What  is  this  infant 
Hercules  of  cryptography,  which  raised  its  inventor  to  such  financial  heights? 

In  essence,  it  is  a gear  with  a variable  number  of  teeth.  These  turn  a cipher 
alphabet  through  as  many  positions  as  there  are  teeth  for  that  particular 
encipherment.  The  various  parts  of  the  mechanism  interact  to  produce  an 
incoherent  running  key  with  a very  long  period.  The  machine  consists  of  four 
main  operating  elements:

(1)  The  cage,  in  which  27*  bars  are  disposed  in  the  form  of  a horizontal 
cylinder,  which  revolves.  The  individual  bars  can  slide  to  the  left.  The  ends 
of  those  bars  that  are  slid  to  the  left  comprise  the  cogs  of  the  variable  gear. 
The  bars  that  are  not  slid  comprise  its  gaps.  Each  bar  carries  two  lugs,  or 
projecting  members,  that  can  be  set  to  two  of  eight  locations  on  the  bar.  Six 
of  these  are  operative,  two  nonoperative.  As  the  cage  turns  toward  the 
operator,  it  will  bring  the  lugs  in  eight  columns  up  over  the  top,  down,  and 
around. 

(2)  Six  flat  vertical  rods  called  “guide  arms”  to  contact  these  projecting 
lugs.  Each  of  the  six  guide  arms  is  matched  with  one  of  the  six  operative 
locations.  The  guide  arms  can  rock  forward  into  an  operative  position  of  their 
own  or  back  into  a nonoperative  position.  In  the  operative  position  a guide 
arm  will  contact  lugs,  but  if  either  lugs  or  guide  arms  are  nonoperative  no 
contact  will  take  place.  Each  guide  arm  has  its  upper  end  angled  to  the  right 
so  that,  when  the  cage  is  turning  and  bringing  an  operative  lug  down  onto  an 
operative  guide  arm,  the  slant  will  push  the  lug  to  the  left.  This  will  carry  the 
lug’s  bar  to  the  left,  adding  a tooth  to  the  variable  gear. 

(3)  Six  keywheels,  each  controlling  a guide  arm.  The  keywheels  have  26, 
25,  23,  21,  19,  and  17  indicator  letters  on  their  rims  and  a pin  underneath  each 
letter.  Each  pin  can  project  either  from  the  right  or  the  left  side  of  its  key  wheel, 
the  right-hand  position  being  its  operative  position.  When  an  operative  pin 
reaches  a certain  point  in  the  revolution  of  the  keywheel,  it  will  move  the 
guide  arm  into  an  operative  position.  When  a nonoperative  pin  reaches  that 
point,  it  will  pull  the  guide  arm  back  into  a nonoperative  position.  Thus  the 
succession  of  operative  and  nonoperative  pin  positions  around  the  circum- 
ference of  a keywheel  will  bring  its  guide  arm  into  and  out  of  operating 
position.  This  determines  whether  lugs  will  be  contacted,  and  hence  whether 
teeth  will  be  added  to  the  variable  gear. 

(4)  The  displacement  and  printing  mechanism.  A knob  at  the  left  of  the 
machine  turns  an  indicating  disk  with  the  26  plaintext  letters.  It  also  turns, 
on  the  same  axis,  a typewheel  that  prints  the  machine’s  output  on  paper  tape, 
and  a typewheel  gear  that  connects,  through  an  intermediate  gear,  with  the 
ends  of  the  slide-bars  that  are  serving  as  the  teeth  of  the  variable  gear.  At  the 
start  of  an  encipherment,  before  the  slide-bar  ends  begin  to  engage  the  inter- 
mediate gear,  these  three  elements  can  revolve  freely  (as  a unit,  not  separ- 
ately), permitting  the  setting  of  any  plaintext  letter  opposite  a benchmark. 

To  encipher,  the  lugs  on  each  bar  must  be  set  in  prearranged  key  locations, 
and  the  pins  on  each  wheel  must  also  be  set  in  prearranged  key  positions.  The 
deciphering  machine  must  naturally  be  set  identically.  The  encipherer  then

where  the  m-209  had  six  keywheels  and  moveable  lugs,  the  c-36  had  only  five  keywheels  and 
fixed  lugs.  The  increase  in  the  number  of  keywheels  and  the  number  of  bars,  and  the 
moveability  of  the  lugs,  is  due  to  Yves  Gylden.  The  operation  of  the  two  models  is  the 
same,  however.

cryptogram  to  permit  the  decipherer  to  set  his  machine  to  the  same  starting 
position.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  encipherer  now  spins  the  knob  on  the  left  to  bring  his  first  plaintext 
letter  on  the  indicating  disk  to  the  benchmark.  Then  he  turns  the  power  handle 
on  the  right.  This  rotates  the  cage,  carrying  the  lugs  over  and  then  down 
toward  the  guide  arms.  Suppose  that  guide  arms  1,  3,  and  5 are  operative. 
Then  all  the  lugs  that  have  been  set  in  operative  locations  1,  3,  and  5 will  strike 
the  inclined  surfaces  of  those  guide  arms.  Lugs  that  are  in  the  nonoperative 
locations  or  in  operative  locations  2,  4,  and  6 will  not  strike  any  guide  arms. 
Lugs  that  do  strike  will  drive  their  bars  to  the  left.  (Since  there  are  two  lugs 
on  each  bar,  there  may  be  some  duplication  of  effort,  if,  for  instance,  a bar 
has  its  lugs  in  locations  1 and  5.  The  result  is  the  same  as  if  only  one  lug  pushed 
the  bar  to  the  left.)  The  ends  of  those  bars  that  have  been  driven  to  the  left 
will  now  be  able  to  mesh  with  the  teeth  of  the  intermediate  gear.  The  ends  of 
the  other  bars  will  miss  it. 

Those  that  mesh  will  transmit  the  turning  motion  of  the  cage  to  the  inter- 
mediate gear,  which  then  turns  the  typewheel  gear.  This  turns  one  space  for 
every  meshed  bar-end,  or  tooth  of  the  variable  gear.  Thus,  if  the  combination 
of  lugs  and  guide  arms  pushes  a total  of  1 5 bars  to  the  left,  the  typewheel  turns 
15  spaces,  thus  shifting  the  plaintext  letter  15  positions  in  the  ciphertext 
alphabet  (which  is  the  alphabet  on  the  typewheel).  The  end  of  the  power 
handle’s  revolution  presses  the  paper  tape  against  the  typewheel  (which  has 
been  inked  by  running  over  the  inkpad)  and  prints  the  ciphertext  letter.  At 
the  same  time,  the  power  handle  advances  all  six  keywheels  one  space  for- 
ward, bringing  into  play  a different  set  of  pins,  which  in  turn  creates  a different 
arrangement  of  operative  and  nonoperative  guide  arms.  The  slid-out  bar-ends 
retract  to  their  original  neutral  position  after  disengaging  from  the  inter- 
mediate gear.  This  completes  the  cycle,  and  the  device  is  now  ready  for  the 
encipherment  of  the  next  letter.  Since  different  guide  arms  are  now  in  opera- 
tive positions,  different  lugs  will  contact  them,  different  bars  will  be  shoved  to 
the  left,  different  bar-ends  will  make  up  the  variable  gear,  and  the  typewheel 
will  be  turned  through  a different  number  of  positions  to  encipher  the 
letter. 

The  cipher  that  the  m-209  produces  in  so  intricate  a fashion  is  a poly- 
alphabetic.  Only  one  primary  ciphertext  alphabet  is  employed,  and  that  the 
normal  reversed  alphabet.  Thus  the  encipherment  may  be  reproduced  by  a 
St.-Cyr  slide  with  a direct  normal  alphabet  for  the  plaintext  and  a reversed 
alphabet  for  the  cipher.  The  variable  gear  shifts  this  ciphertext  alphabet  in  a 
highly  irregular  sequence  to  its  26  possible  positions.  Because  this  sequence 
cannot  repeat  until  the  guide  arms  repeat  their  successive  positions,  because 
they  cannot  repeat  until  the  keywheels  do,  and  because  the  keywheels  have 
no  factor  in  common,  the  sequence  will  not  recommence  until  26  x 25  x 23  x 
21  x 19  x 17  letters  have  been  enciphered.  This  gives  the  m-209  a period  of 
101,405,850  letters. 

This  figure,  nearly  ten  times  greater  than  that  of  a five-wheel  rotor 
machine,  discourages  a straight  Kasiski  solution.  But,  as  with  a rotor  system.

heavy  traffic  may  produce  two  settings  of  the  keywheels  close  enough  together 
to  cause  two  messages  to  overlap  portions  of  that  long  sequence.  A kappa  test 
can  sound  out  these  overlaps.  Then,  since  the  cipher  alphabet  is  known,  the 
cryptanalyst  can  solve  these  two  identically-keyed  ciphertexts  by  seeing 
whether  a plaintext  assumption  in  one  message  produces  intelligible  text  in 
the  other. 

With  the  plaintext  for  a length  of  ciphertext,  the  cryptanalyst  can  then 
recover  the  machine’s  lug  and  pin  settings.  He  begins  from  the  observation 
that  each  lug  can  cause  a shift  of  one  space  in  the  position  of  the  cipher 
alphabet.  If  operative,  it  will  kick  this  alphabet  forward  one  space.  Thus,  if 
the  ciphertext  letter  b would  have  occurred  without  this  lug,  its  operation  will 
produce  an  A (the  alphabet  is  reversed).  Conversely,  if  the  cryptanalyst  tries  a 
lug  in  a nonoperative  location  when  in  fact  it  should  be  operative,  it  will 
subtract  a kick,  producing  a b instead  of  an  a.  A lug  in  the  wrong  operative 
location  will  add  some  kicks  and  subtract  others.  These  effects  will  occur  at 
nonperiodic  intervals. 

The  effects  of  keywheel  pins,  on  the  other  hand,  will  show  up  at  periodic 
intervals.  If,  for  example,  an  encipherer  has  set  a pin  on  the  19-letter  keywheel 
incorrectly,  the  decipherer  will  find  a wrong  letter  appearing  every  19  letters. 
This  letter  will  be  many  kicks  removed  from  the  correct  one  since  the  guide 
arm  will  have  wrongly  activated  many  lugs.  On  the  basis  of  these  principles, 
by  considering  the  lugs  in  a column  as  a group,  by  setting  up  algebraic  equa- 
tions in  from  six  to  four  unknowns,  and  by  repeated  cross-corrections,  the 
cryptanalyst  can  determine  the  key  settings.  Usually  150  letters  will  suffice, 
and,  if  he  is  lucky,  as  few  as  35.  The  required  plaintext  may  be  obtained  by 
probable  words  or  stereotyped  beginnings  in  a single  message,  and  even  if  a 
complete  recovery  cannot  be  made,  a partial  one  can  be  and  then  expanded 
later. 

The  machine’s  handicap  of  mediocre  security  is  partially  overcome  by  the 
ease  of  changing  the  internal  settings,  of  which  there  are,  literally,  vigin- 
tillions.  And  it  presents  many  operational  advantages.  It  prints  the  output, 
properly  spaced — ciphertext  in  groups  of  five,  plaintext  in  word-lengths 
(usually  z is  used  as  a spacer,  so  that  minimize  will  come  out  minimi  e).  A 
counter  that  shows  the  number  of  letters  enciphered  or  deciphered  allows 
easy  checking  of  errors.  A reset  button  permits  turning  the  keywheel  assembly 
back  to  a previous  position.  If  the  machine  runs  out  of  tape,  the  ciphertext 
letters  can  be  read  off  an  indicating  disk.  Packed  within  the  3^  x 54  x 7 
inches  of  its  housing  are  paper  tape,  oil,  extra  inkpads,  tweezers,  and  screw- 
driver. It  weighs  about  six  pounds  and  is  extremely  rugged,  able  to  survive 
jolts,  dust,  sand,  tropic  humidity,  and  arctic  chill.  Actual  operation  could 
hardly  be  simpler,  requiring  only  the  turning  of  a knob  to  bring  the  plain- 
or  ciphertext  letter  opposite  a mark,  then  the  flipping  of  the  power  handle 
to  revolve  the  mechanism.  Encipherment  runs  at  from  15  to  30  letters  a 
minute.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


From  a purely  mechanical  point  of  view  the  device  is  an  absolute  marvel. 
Hagelin  has  engineered  a mechanism  that  spouts  an  extremely  long  key  from 
relatively  few  elements  in  an  astonishingly  compact  format,  which  also 
permits  of  practically  unlimited  key  changes.  It  is  the  most  ingenious  mech- 
anical creation  in  all  cryptography. 

In  1944,  Hagelin,  now  a multimillionaire,  returned  to  Sweden  on  a safe- 
conduct  vessel  that  took  30  days  to  cross  the  Atlantic.  “With  my  earnings,” 
he  said,  “I  bought  myself  a 2,000-acre  estate  with  a brick  factory  30  miles 
south  of  Stockholm,  outside  Sodertage,  as  I thought  that  the  cipher  machine 
business  was  finished.”  How  wrong  he  was!  First  came  the  cold  war.  As  the 
two  great  powers  built  up  their  military  might  and  those  of  their  satellites  in 
mutual  fear  and  mistrust,  a new  market  came  into  being  for  cipher  machines. 
Then  the  old  colonial  empires  broke  up.  The  dozens  of  new  nations  that 
emerged  from  the  ruins  created  a market  for  cipher  machines  far  wider  than 
any  that  had  yet  existed.  To  safeguard  the  communications  of  their  little 
armies  and  of  the  diplomatic  posts  that  they  established  all  over  the  world, 
these  countries  turned  to  Hagelin. 

At  first  his  entire  Aktiebolaget  Cryptoteknik  organization  was  con- 
centrated in  Stockholm.  But  a Swedish  law  enabling  the  government  to 
appropriate  inventions  that  it  needed  for  national  defense  compelled  him  to 
take  his  developmental  work  to  Zug,  Switzerland,  in  1948.  Zug  proved  so 
attractive — not  least  because  of  its  tax  benefits,  for  which  it  is  widely  known — 
that  in  1959  Hagelin  moved  the  rest  of  the  firm  there,  incorporating  it  as 
Crypto  Aktiengesellschaft. 

The  corporation  is  housed  in  a four-story  tan  stucco  factory  building  at 
10  Weinbergstrasse  on  a hillside  in  the  middle  of  a residential  section.  It  looks 
out  at  the  sparkling  Lake  of  Zug  and  beyond  to  the  distant  bluish  Swiss  Alps 
— probably  the  loveliest  setting  in  which  cryptology  has  ever  been  practiced. 
From  inside  come  the  humming,  buzzing  sounds  typical  of  any  light  industry. 
The  170  employees  mostly  just  assemble  parts  that  Hagelin  has  purchased 
from  manufacturers  in  Switzerland  and  Germany;  if  he  made  all  his  own 
parts,  he  would  need  a work  force  of  300.  The  building’s  top  floor  holds  the 
drafting  offices,  and  the  third  floor  the  administrative,  where  Hagelin  has  a 
two-shelf  “museum”  of  cipher  machines.  Tool-making  occupies  the  first  floor, 
together  with  some  die-stamping;  assembly  takes  place  on  the  second  floor, 
where  stacks  of  parts  stand  next  to  a tiny  watchmaker’s  lathe  and  where  work- 
men solder  ultrasonically.  In  a laboratory,  engineers  create  and  test  new 
mechanisms,  such  as  electronic  devices  that  simulate  mechanical  operation  to 
attain  very  high-speed  operation.  Hagelin  does  not  attempt  to  cryptanalyze 
his  own  machine  ciphers,  however,  probably  because  he  fully  understands  the 
principles  of  solution  and  realizes  that  the  success  of  his  machines  depends  on 
proper  usage.  Instead  he  draws  upon  the  reactions  of  his  users  for  improvement 
ideas.

Secrecy  for  Sale 

The  firm  sells  three  basic  machines.  The  c-52  is  a vastly  improved  form  of 
the  c-48,  the  firm’s  designation  for  the  m-209.  Though  it  employs  the  same 
basic  mechanism,  its  key  wheels  have  47,  43,  41,  37,  31,  and  29  pins  on  them, 
whose  period  of  2,756,205,443  reduces  the  likelihood  of  overlap.  The  key- 
wheels  can  be  removed  and  reinserted  in  a different  order.  The  typewheel 
carries  a mixed  alphabet.  The  indicating  disk  appears  as  a dial  that  shows  all 
letters  at  once  and  is  easier  to  operate.  With  some  modifications,  it  is  crypto- 
graphically compatible  with  the  older  c-48’s,  a thoughtful  arrangement  that 
enables  countries  that  have  bought  the  older  ones  to  use  them  with  the  newer 
ones  until  they  wear  out,  thereby  easing  the  strain  on  the  communications 
budget.  Price:  $600. 

The  cd-55  is  a pocket  machine,  5 x 3 x 1^  inches,  or  slightly  larger  than  a 
transistor  radio.  It  weighs  only  22  ounces.  Its  mechanism  differs  from  the  c-52 
but  produces  the  same  cipher.  A power  lever  that  springs  out  from  the  side  of 
the  machine  is  pressed  in  and  released  by  the  thumb.  This  turns  the  inner  ring 
of  the  two  circular  alphabets — one  plain,  one  cipher — displayed  on  the  face 
of  the  machine.  This  midget  sells  for  $200. 

The  t-55  is  an  on-line  device  that  enciphers  teletypewriter  pulses  instead 
of  letters,  either  by  an  appropriate  modification  of  the  Hagelin  cage  principle 
or  by  a straightforward  one-time  tape  Vernam  principle.  To  make  sure  that 
the  tape  is  truly  one-time,  this  machine  slices  it  in  half  after  use!  It  is  much 
larger  and  heavier  than  the  other  machines. 

In  addition,  Hagelin  tempts  his  customers  with  a full  line  of  accessories, 
which  in  their  way  are  not  unlike  those  that  hi-fi  addicts  or  yachtsmen  find  so 
hard  to  resist.  A base  with  a keyboard  and  an  electric  motor  fits  under  the 
j C-52  to  convert  it  to  rapid,  typewriter-like  operation — for  $ 1 ,000.  (This  gadget 

replaces  the  wholly  separate  electrical  printing  machines  that  the  firm  used  to 
manufacture.)  Attachment  pe-61  will  perforate  a teletypewriter  tape  with  the 
c-52’s  ciphertext.  To  facilitate  setting  the  keywheel  pins,  the  pin-setter  srp-58 
is  available.  Arabs,  Burmese,  Thais,  and  other  users  of  non-Latin  alphabets 
may  purchase  machines  with  their  own  scripts;  these  usually  serve  only  for 
the  plaintext,  the  ciphertext  using  the  Latin  letters  which  are  more  acceptable 
in  international  communications.  Units  to  produce  one-time  tapes  may  also 
be  purchased.  (These  usually  generate  the  random  keys  required  from  one  of 
the  most  random  processes  known:  the  decay  of  a radioactive  element.  A 
Geiger  counter  causes  the  unit  to  punch  a hole  in  the  tape  whenever  the 
disintegration  exceeds  a certain  level  in  a given  period  of  time;  it  leaves  a 
blank  when  the  rate  falls  below  this  level.  Thermal  noise,  which  is  equally 
unpredictable,  is  also  used.) 

Nearly  all  Crypto  Aktiengesellschaft’s  production  goes  to  its  approxim- 
ately 60  governmental  customers,  whose  military  services  buy  substantially 
more  than  their  diplomatic.  Complete  installations  typically  cost  from 
between  $30,000  and  $50,000.  When  the  purchasers  squawk  about  the  price,  as 
they  invariably  do,  Hagelin’s  representatives  ask  them  whether  they  ever  send 


434 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


messages  whose  value  is  much  greater  than  that.  This  quiets  them.  A minute 
portion  of  the  firm’s  output  goes  to  commercial  users,  nearly  all  of  whom  have 
international  interests,  usually  highly  competitive,  such  as  oil  and  mining,  or 
highly  confidential,  such  as  finance. 

The  firm  explains  that  the  “tremendous  number  of  variable  elements”— 
more  than  24  quintillion  quintillion  quintillion  quintillion — enables  each 
customer  to  select  an  individual  set  of  keys.  It  advises  which  key  procedures 
are  good  and  which  bad,  but  carefully  refrains  from  recommending  specific 
keys  because  it  does  not  want  one  customer  to  think  that  it  is  giving  them 
instructions  that  it  could  also  give  to  others.  “It  is  not  good  business  practice 
for  us  to  be  knowledgeable  of  the  details  of  the  customer’s  machine  and  usage, 
which  should  be  truly  national  secrets,”  says  the  company  in  its  instruction 
brochure,  “any  more  than  it  would  be  for  the  safe  manufacturer  to  know  the 
combination  of  his  customer’s  safe.” 

Hagelin,  whose  house  in  Zug  stands  a few  dozen  yards  behind  his  factory, 
has  retired  only  partially.  He  does  not  spend  all  day  at  his  unique  operation, 
but  he  still  does  most  of  the  firm’s  development  work.  He  says,  “I  don’t  under- 
stand electronics  but  I know  what  it  can  do.”  He  handles  his  old  customers, 
though  he  leaves  the  new  ones  and  many  administrative  details  to  his  general 
manager,  Sture  Nyberg.  A white-haired  man  of  greater  than  average  height 
and  of  average  build,  with  firm,  pleasant  features,  Hagelin  has  a quiet  humor 
and  a gentleness  about  him.  Is  it  true  that  he  speaks  five  languages  fluently? 
“Only  one  at  a time,”  he  smiles.  In  his  pockets  he  carries  peanuts  to  feed  the 
birds  that  fly  to  his  window;  one  day  one  perched  on  his  head  and  another 
on  his  arm  as  he  was  walking  up  the  steps  from  his  office  to  his  home.  At  night 
they  leave  their  “calling  cards”  on  his  bedroom  light. 

His  interests  are  wide.  He  discusses  food  like  a gourmet,  takes  good 
amateur  photographs,  enjoys  sailing,  and  talks  knowledgeably  about  the 
flowers  in  the  beds  behind  his  house  cultivated  by  his  wife,  the  former  Annie 
Barth,  a distant  relation  of  theologian  Karl  Barth.  He  lives  very  well.  Twice  a 
year  he  returns  to  Sweden,  either  to  his  estate  outside  of  Stockholm  or  to  a 
log  cottage  in  the  north.  A souffle  served  at  luncheon  by  his  cook  will  be  as 
high  and  fluffy  and  tasty  as  any  in  a fine  restaurant  in  New  York  or  Paris.  The 
smell  of  the  tan  leather  upholstery  in  the  white  Mercedes-Benz  that  he  drives 
is  almost  overpowering.  His  guest  book  contains  signatures  from  all  over  the 
world— the  United  States,  France,  Egypt,  Iran,  Germany— and  he  hirnself  is 
an  extremely  gracious  and  considerate  host.  Hagelin  has  enjoyed  greater 
material  rewards  from  cryptology  than  any  other  person  in  the  world,  and  it 
might  well  be  said  that  it  couldn’t  have  happened  to  a nicer  guy.

DUEL  IN  THE  ETHER:  THE  AXIS 


shortly  after  noon  on  the  tense  31st  of  August,  1939,  the  last  day  of 
peace  that  the  world  was  to  know  for  six  years,  Swedish  businessman  Birger 
Dahlerus  met  with  Hermann  Goring  at  the  Nazi  leader’s  large  and  richly 
furnished  town  house  at  2 Leipzigerstrasse  in  Berlin.  Dahlerus  had  been 
trying  desperately  to  avert  the  onrushing  cataclysm  of  war  by  flying  between 
England  and  Germany  as  Goring’s  unofficial  mediator.  Britain  had  pledged 
to  aid  Poland  if  Hitler  attacked  her,  and,  in  an  effort  to  stave  off  actual  war- 
fare had  proposed  to  both  Germany  and  Poland  that  they  negotiate  their 
differences  directly.  At  a few  minutes  past  one,  as  Dahlerus  and  Goring  were 
discussing  the  situation,  an  adjutant  brought  in  a red  envelope  of  the  kind 
used  for  especially  urgent  affairs  of  state.  Goring  ripped  it  open.  When  he  read 
its  contents,  he  leaped  from  his  chair  and,  striding  angrily  up  and  down,  raged 
at  Dahlerus  that  he  had  in  his  hands  proof  that  the  Poles  were  sabotaging 
every  move  toward  negotiation. 

After  a few  minutes  he  calmed  down  enough  to  tell  the  Swede  what  had 
been  in  the  envelope.  It  was  a telegram  from  the  Polish  government  in 
Warsaw  to  its  ambassador  in  Berlin.  It  was  in  code,  of  course,  but  the  crypt- 
analysts of  the  German  Foreign  Office,  who  had  long  ago  cracked  the  Polish 
diplomatic  code,  had  reduced  it  to  plaintext  at  once,  translated  it  into  German, 
and  sent  a copy  to  Goring  via  messenger.  The  entire  process  had  taken  less 
than  an  hour. 

At  the  end  of  the  telegram  came  a “special  and  secret  message”  to  the 
ambassador:  “Do  not  enter  under  any  circumstances  into  any  factual  discus- 
sions. . . .”  To  Goring  this  proved  so  conclusively  that  the  Poles  had  no 
intention  of  negotiating  in  good  faith  that  he  copied  the  translation  in  his  own 
hand  for  Dahlerus  to  show  the  British  ambassador.  The  German  Air  Minister 
told  Dahlerus  that  he  was  taking  a great  risk  in  doing  this — he  undoubtedly 
meant  jeopardizing  Germany’s  possession  of  the  Polish  code — but  felt  that 
Britain  should  know  how  faithless  the  Poles  were. 

In  fact  this  was  not  a reason  for  going  to  war,  but  just  another  excuse  to 
do  so.  The  Germans  were  using  Dahlerus  as  a cat’s-paw,  for  at  the  very 
moment  that  Dahlerus  entered  Goring’s  home,  Adolf  Hitler  was  signing  his 
“Directive  No.  1 for  the  Conduct  of  the  War.”  At  daybreak  the  next  morning

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


German  troops  invaded  Poland.  And  although  the  Foreign  Office  solution  of 
the  Polish  message  had  no  role  in  that  attack  except  to  confirm  the  Nazis  in 
their  perfidy,  it  did  demonstrate  the  keenness  and  efficiency  of  one  of  Ger- 
many’s major  intelligence  weapons  as  she  embarked  upon  what  she  fondly 
thought  would  be  her  blitzkrieg  of  conquest. 

The  cryptanalytic  service  of  the  German  Foreign  Office  was  created  early 
in  1919,  apparently  at  the  suggestion  of  Kurt  Selchow,  a 32-year-old  former 
captain  in  the  Army  intercept  service.  Selchow  became  its  administrative  chief 
and  staffed  it  with  cryptologic  acquaintances  from  the  war.  His  organization 
was  at  first  known  as  Referat  I Z,  the  z section  of  Division  I,  Personnel  and 
Budget,  of  the  Foreign  Office.  It  included  both  the  cryptanalytic  service  (the 
Chiffrierwesen)  and  the  cryptographic  (the  Chiffrierbiiro),  the  latter  twice  as 
large  as  the  former.  Around  1936  a reorganization  of  the  Foreign  Office 
renamed  1 Z as  Pers  z (pronounced  “pers-zed”),  the  z section  of  the  Personnel 
and  Administrative  Division.  The  z meant  nothing — the  division  did  not  have 
26  sections — and  it  may  have  been  chosen  because  it  seemed  appropriate  to 
cryptology.  Much  later.  Foreign  Minister  Joachim  von  Ribbentrop  took 
the  Chiffrierbiiro  under  his  own  office,  presumably  to  restrict  access  to  his  own 
coded  telegrams. 

By  1939,  Pers  z had  divided  the  Chiffrierwesen  into  two  groups — one  that 
dealt  with  ciphers,  either  as  primary  systems  or  as  superencipherments,  and 
that  was  heavily  mathematical  in  personnel  and  approach;  and  one  that 
dealt  with  codes  and  emphasized  the  linguistic.*  Three  senior  cryptanalysts 
headed  them — Rudolf  Schauffler  and  Adolf  Paschke  as  joint  chiefs  of  the 
linguistic  section,  Dr.  Werner  Kunze  as  chief  of  the  mathematicians.  All  were 
veterans  of  the  military  cryptanalytic  bureaus  that  Germany  had  belatedly 
started  in  World  War  I;  all  joined  the  Foreign  Office  in  1919  when  they  were 
close  to  30.  Schauffler  and  Kunze  participated  in  the  development  of  the 
one-time  pad. 

Kunze  had  his  doctorate  in  mathematics  from  the  University  of  Heidel- 
berg, where  he  also  studied  physics  and  philosophy.  A cavalryman  for  most 
of  World  War  I,  he  began  cryptanalysis  in  January  of  1918,  solving  some 
English  ciphers  but  working  for  several  months  without  success  on  a British 
code.  During  his  first  years  in  the  Foreign  Office,  he  studied  cryptanalysis, 
emphasizing  theory  and  applying  his  mathematical  knowledge.  Kunze  may 
well  have  been  the  first  mathematician  employed  in  a modern  cryptanalytic 
office.  About  1921  he  opened  his  first  major  assault — on  the  superencipher- 
ment of  a French  diplomatic  code.  He  solved  it  in  1923,  thus  learning  early 
the  need  for  persistence  and  patience  in  cryptanalysis.  His  theoretical  studies 
helped  him  in  the  joint  development  of  the  one-time  pad  for  German  diplo- 
matic systems. 

* This  division  carries  into  the  practical  sphere  the  distinction  that  codes  operate  upon 
texts  linguistically  whereas  ciphers  operate  nonlinguistically. 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


437 


In  the  spring  of  1936,  he  undertook  his  finest  work:  ascertaining  the 
system  of  and  ultimately  solving  a Japanese  machine  cipher,  apparently  known 
to  the  Americans  as  the  orange  system  that  preceded  the  red  machine  that 
preceded  purple,  the  same  system  solved  by  the  U.S.  Navy’s  Lieutenant 
Jack  S.  Holtwick,  Jr.  Kunze  thought  that  the  solution  would  take  only  six 
weeks,  but  it  was  not  until  the  day  before  he  went  on  his  vacation  in  July  that 
he  made  his  entry.  The  machine  enciphered  vowels  into  vowels  and  consonants 
into  consonants  by  separate  sets  of  rotors,  and  by  September  Kunze  had 
recovered  all  the  alphabets  used  in  the  machine.  He  also  solved  the  later  red, 
in  which  vowels  and  consonants  were  enciphered  indiscriminately  through  the 
two  rotor  arrays.  But  neither  he  nor  anyone  else  in  Pers  z ever  solved  the 
final  system  of  this  development,  the  purple  machine. 

Paschke  and  Schauffler  served  as  joint  heads  of  the  linguistic  group  be- 
cause it  was  so  large.  Paschke  was  the  nominal  head,  handled  more  of  the 
administration,  and  was  in  charge  of  European  languages;  Schauffler,  an 
expert  in  Asiatic  languages  who  was  in  charge  of  them,  also  had  a good 
grounding  in  mathematics.  He  concentrated  more  on  the  substantive  work. 
As  one  colleague  described  it,  “Paschke  said  he  was  in  charge  and  Schauffler 
was  modest  and  didn’t  object.”  Paschke,  a slight,  erect  man,  with  a little 
mustache  and  a small  smile,  was  sensitive  and  touchy,  but  courteous  and  a 
good  family  man.  Born  in  St.  Petersburg,  he  got  into  cryptology  in  1915 
because  of  his  expertise  in  Russian.  Though  he  was  a lawyer,  he  liked  crypt- 
ology so  much  that  he  stuck  with  it,  working  on  Russian,  British,  and  Italian 
codes.  He  was  a natural  linguist.  One  of  his  specialities  was  to  establish  the 
meanings  of  the  first  500  or  so  codegroups  of  a code  and  then  to  turn  it 
over  to  a less  able  cryptanalyst  for  the  much  easier  task  of  completing  the 
solution. 

Schauffler,  a nervous  and  high-strung  man  who  had  studied  at  Tubingen 
and  Munich,  and  had  taught  school  before  the  war,  started  his  cryptanalytical 
career  at  Army  headquarters  in  1916.  A thorough  student  who  felt  that  a 
comprehensive  theory  would  pay  off  in  practice,  he  probed  much  more 
deeply  into  the  core  of  cryptology  than  the  others,  who  mostly  limited  them- 
selves to  practical  results.  Thus  he  tried  to  systematize  the  science,  sought  to 
impose  a uniform  terminology,  kept  up  with  the  work  going  on  in  all  areas, 
and  either  wrote  or  encouraged  the  writing  of  reports  on  important  topics. 
Pers  z’s  theoretical  investigations  into  the  mathematical  structure  of  the 
Enigma  and  into  the  regularities  in  a stack  of  codewords  that  are  necessary  to 
correct  garbles  but  that  correspondingly  help  cryptanalysts  were  probably 
inspired  by  Schauffler,  as  well  as  its  texts  on  cryptology,  its  “Introduction  to 
Probability  Theory”  with  applications  to  cryptanalysis,  and  its  preparation  of 
graphs  and  nomograms.  Schauffler  bridged  the  linguists  and  the  mathemati- 
cians— he  knew  the  main  Asiatic  languages  well  enough  to  provide  the 
linguistic  data  to  help  Kunze  reconstruct  the  alphabets  of  the  Japanese  cipher 
machines.  After  the  war  he  got  his  doctorate  in  mathematics.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


These  three  were  chiefly  assisted  by  three  other  old-timers,  Erich  Langlotz, 
the  third  inventor  of  the  one-time  pad;  Ernst  Hoffmann,  who  held  the  title  of 
Counsel  for  the  High  Cipher  Service ; and  Hermann  Scherschmidt,  a specialist 
in  Polish  and  other  Slavonic  codes.  All  usually  held  the  same  rank  of  Regie- 
rungsrat  that  Kunze,  Schauffler,  and  Paschke  did.  In  1933,  when  Hitler  came 
to  power,  Pers  z employed  about  30  civil  servants.  As  Germany  rearmed, 
Pers  z expanded,  though  slowly  at  first.  Recruiting  was  subtle:  prospective 
recruits  did  not  know  that  they  were  being  considered  for  the  highly  secret 
work  of  cryptanalysis.  One  woman,  Asta  Friedrichs,  who  had  taught  school 
in  Bulgaria  and  knew  that  language,  which  Pers  z needed,  was  simply  asked  if 
she  would  like  to  learn  Serbo-Croatian  and  do  some  work  involving  it;  she 
accepted,  and  not  until  after  a probationary  period  was  she  told  about  the 
codebreaking.  She  began  solving  Serbo-Croatian  codes,  then  some  Bulgarian, 
then  helped  with  others. 

With  the  outbreak  of  war,  Pers  z's  growth  became  explosive.  Among  the 
brightest  of  its  new  members  was  Dr.  Hans  Rohrbach,  a 37-year-old  mathe- 
matician who  later  became  editor  of  the  oldest  mathematical  journal  in  the 
world,  the  Journal  of  Pure  and  Applied  Mathematics.  Another  mathematician 
was  Dr.  Gottfried  Kothe,  later  rector  of  Heidelberg  University.  The  agency 
needed  people  and  it  made  exceptions.  Ottfried  Deubner,  whose  father,  Lud- 
wig, had  solved  Russian  military  cryptograms  for  Germany  in  World  War  I, 
was  partly  Jewish,  but  he  was  allowed  to  join  and  work  on  Italian  cryptograms 
because  of  his  father’s  earlier  contributions;  the  Nazis  made  him  an  honorary 
Aryan. 

For  several  years,  Pers  z had  been  situated  on  the  top  floor  of  the  library 
building  just  behind  the  Foreign  Office  main  building  in  Berlin’s  Wilhelm- 
strasse.  But  by  early  1940,  it  had  burst  out  of  these  quarters.  The  mathemati- 
cians moved  out  first,  into  several  flats  in  an  apartment  house  at  w-8  Jaeger- 
strasse  that  had  been  entirely  taken  over  by  the  Foreign  Office.  Their  depar- 
ture relieved  the  crowding  in  the  original  office  only  temporarily,  and  soon 
the  linguistic  codesolvers  found  new  offices,  first  in  an  anthropological 
museum,  where  they  were  surrounded  by  artifacts  from  Siam,  and  then  in 
Dahlem,  a suburb  of  Berlin.  Here  some  worked  in  a garden  apartment  on  a 
street  called  ImDol,  some  in  a nearby  girls’  boarding  school,  where  they  were 
joined  in  1943  by  the  mathematicians.  The  combined  group,  the  Chiffrier- 
wesen  arm  of  Pers  z,  called  itself  the  Sonderdienst  Dahlem  (“Dahlem  Special 
Service”).  While  there,  during  the  middle  period  of  the  war,  it  consisted  of 
about  200  staff  members — 20  to  25  mathematical  cryptanalysts,  probably  the 
same  number  of  linguistic  cryptanalysts,  the  rest  clerks  and  support  staffers. 
Later  it  grew  to  300. 

Heavy  bombings — the  workers  had  to  spend  nearly  every  night  in  air-raid 
shelters — forced  still  another  move  in  the  summer  of  1944.  The  linguistic 
branch  moved  150  miles  southeast  to  Hirschberg  in  Silesia,  where  they 
installed  themselves  in  another  school;  the  mathematicians  moved  to  the 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


439 


nearby  town  of  Hermsdorf.  The  odyssey  of  Pers  z did  not  end  even  there, 
however.  In  February,  1945,  the  advance  of  the  Russians  compelled  each 
group  to  move  about  1 50  miles  west.  The  mathematicians  evacuated  to  Zschep- 
plin  Castle,  near  Eilenburg,  about  80  miles  south  of  Berlin.  The  linguists, 
joined  by  a few  mathematicians  to  strip  current  superencipherments,  moved 
into  a wing  of  Burgscheidungen  Castle  near  Naumburg,  northwest  of  Wiemar. 
Here,  as  wartime  guests  of  the  Count  von  der  Schulenburg  and  his  five 
daughters,  the  90  cryptanalysts,  some  with  their  wives,  lived  and  worked  amid 
art  treasures  and  ancient  furniture,  handicapped  by  the  almost  total  lack  of 
liaison  with  the  mathematicians,  about  50  miles  away. 

The  ever-present  problems  of  security  added  to  the  difficulties  of  Pers  z. 
Ink  was  not  permitted  because  it  required  blotting  paper.  Each  night  all 
papers  had  to  be  locked  away.  Waste  paper  had  to  be  burned,  and  the 
ashes  broken  up  to  make  sure  that  no  cinder  would  float  away.  Later  Pers 
z got  a machine  to  shred  the  paper  before  it  was  incinerated.  None  of 
the  codesolving  groups  was  allowed  to  know  what  the  others  were  doing — 
but  these  artificial  barriers  dissolved  in  the  camaraderie  of  the  Dahlem 
bomb-shelter. 

Security  also  meant  political  security,  and  even  before  the  war  the  Nazis 
planted  a spy  in  Pers  z to  watch  for  any  signs  of  anti-Hitler  activity.  In  1942 
Selchow  became  a Nazi.  He  took  the  honorary  rank  of  Sturmfuhrer,  which 
gave  him  access  to  three  or  four  cars.  The  next  year  he  became  an  Ober- 
sturmfiihrer  because  this  gave  him  “a  certain  authority  with  the  drivers.” 
However,  he  insisted,  he  never  wore  the  uniform.  Among  the  cryptanalysts, 
Paschke,  Schauffler,  and  Kunze,  at  least,  also  joined  the  Nazi  party. 

The  cryptanalysts’  raw  material  was  intercepted  by  either  military  radio 
stations  or  the  post  office  telegraph  bureau.  In  Silesia,  it  came  in  by  courier 
about  noon.  Most  of  the  diplomatic  messages  bore  address  and  signature,  so 
few  traffic-analysis  problems  of  discovering  language,  cryptographic  family, 
and  the  like,  arose.  The  cryptanalyses  required  enormous  volumes  of  text  and 
corresponding  quantities  of  statistics.  The  army  of  clerks,  mostly  women, 
compiled  these,  but  it  usually  paid  the  cryptanalysts  to  work  up  a few  statistics 
themselves.  The  solutions  took  a heavy  toll  of  nervous  energy.  “You  must 
concentrate  almost  in  a nervous  trance  when  working  on  a code,”  Miss 
Friedrichs  recalled.  “It  is  not  often  done  by  conscious  effort.”  The  solution 
often  seems  to  crop  up  from  the  subconscious. 

The  subconscious  got  considerable  help,  however,  from  an  information 
group  headed  by  Pastor  Joachim  Ziegenriicker.  The  group  collated  informa- 
tion from  radio  broadcasts,  Foreign  Office  memoranda,  Allied  newspapers  (it 
read  The  Times  throughout  the  war),  and  the  Pers  z output  so  that,  as  Miss 
Friedrichs  said,  they  could  give  the  answer  when  the  cryptanalysts  asked  them 
“Who  beginning  with  w spoke  with  somebody  ending  with  n in  a place  with  a 
kind  of po  on  Thursday?” 

More  help  came  from  the  financial  bonuses  that  kept  up  the  codebreakers’

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


knowledge  of  foreign  languages.  The  amount  depended  upon  the  difficulty  of 
the  tongue;  nothing  was  paid  for  English  and  French,  which  they  were 
expected  to  know  anyway.  The  codebreakers  had  to  take  an  examination  in 
the  language  every  four  years  to  prove  their  continued  competence,  and  many 
of  them  learned  four  languages,  taking  an  examination  each  year  and  brush- 
ing up  at  the  local  Berlitz  school  for  a month  before  the  test.  Pers  z had 
experts  in  the  language  of  almost  every  country  large  enough  to  maintain  a 
diplomatic  corps.  One  Olbricht  attacked  the  difficult  problems  of  breaking 
Chinese  codes.  A man  named  Benzing  took  such  delight  in  the  Turkish 
language  and  Turkish  cryptanalysis  that  his  confreres  regarded  him  as  a 
veritable  Turcomaniac. 

The  cryptanalysts  received  some  of  their  greatest  help  from  robots— 
mechanisms  that  speedily  performed  some  of  the  highly  repetitious  tasks 
required,  or  that  simplified  the  handling  of  many  items.  Many  were  tabulating 
machines  that  used  punched  cards  in  ordinary  ways.  But  many  others  were 
assembled  out  of  standard  parts  for  special  purposes  by  Hans-Georg  Krug,  a 
former  high  school  mathematics  teacher  who  possessed  a positive  genius  for 
this  sort  of  thing. 

Messages  were  punched  onto  the  cards  (or  sometimes,  in  the  case  of  some 
Siemens  machines,  onto  paper  tape)  and  run  through  the  mechanism  to 
tabulate  frequencies,  to  search  for  repetitions  or  interrupted  (partial)  repeti- 
tions and  calculate  the  intervals  between  them,  to  sort  texts.  One  arrangement 
of  the  machines,  called  the  special  comparer,  automatically  solved  single 
columnar  transposition.  Using  the  punched  cards,  it  extracted  a portion  of  the 
ciphertext  of  the  probable  length  of  a column  of  the  transposition  tableau. 
Then  it  paraded  the  rest  of  the  ciphertext  past  this  fixed  portion,  calculating 
the  frequency  of  digraphs  at  each  juxtaposition.  The  match  that  yielded  the 
highest  frequency  probably  represented  two  adjacent  columns  of  the  tableau. 
The  process  was  then  repeated  with  the  new  column  to  extend  the  reconstruc- 
tion. Since  the  device  could  compare  the  digraphs  against  any  set  of  fre- 
quencies stored  in  it,  it  may  have  been  adapted  to  solve  transposed  code,  if 
the  underlying  code  were  known. 

The  machines  were  ideal  for  what  was  probably  the  single  most  common 
cryptanalytic  procedure  of  the  war — the  stripping  of  a numerical  additive 
from  enciphered  code.  Axis,  Allied,  and  neutral  cryptanalysts  employed  the 
identical  technique,  which  each  major  power  apparently  developed  independ- 
ently, probably  between  the  wars.  Military  cryptanalytic  units  in  the  field 
employed  it  on  a manual,  pencil-and-paper  basis. 

It  is  generally  called  the  “difference  method.”  The  cryptanalyst  first  identi- 
fies, by  indicators  or  traffic  analyses  or  other  information,  a group  of  encicode 
messages  that  he  believes  used  the  same  basic  code  and  portions,  at  least,  of 
the  same  long  additive  key.  Using  repetitions  or  clues  from  indicators  as 
anchor  points,  he  places  the  messages  one  under  another  so  that  the  identical 
portions  of  the  additive  key  will  stand  in  vertical  alignment.  (If  no  information 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


441 


suggests  an  alignment,  the  cryptanalyst  may  have  to  try  one  after  another  to 
see  if  any  produces  results.) 

He  subtracts  every  encicode  group  in  a column  from  every  other.  He 
subtracts  the  first  group  from  itself,  from  the  second,  third,  fourth,  and  so  on, 
encicode  groups,  the  second  group  from  itself,  from  the  third,  fourth,  and  so 
on.  The  differences  resulting  from  these  “runs”  are  listed  in  a difference  book, 
which  also  gives  the  location  of  the  two  encicode  groups  that  produced  each 
difference.  The  cryptanalyst  repeats  the  subtractions  for  every  column  and 
indexes  all  differences  in  the  difference  book.  He  then  examines  this  book  for 
two  columns  that  have  a difference  in  common.  This  common  difference 
indicates  that  the  two  columns  include  the  same  placode  group,  which  each 
column  has  enciphered  with  its  own  additive. 

The  identity  makes  it  possible  for  the  cryptanalyst  to  reduce  the  two 
columns  to  an  equivalent  form.  In  the  first  column,  he  simply  subtracts  the 
encicode  group  whose  run  produced  the  same  difference  as  the  second  column 
from  every  other  encicode  group  in  the  first  column — or,  in  other  words,  he 
just  picks  up  the  figures  for  that  run.  He  does  the  same  for  the  second  column 
with  its  encicode  group.  This  produces  a relative  placode  in  both  columns. 
All  groups  in  the  two  columns  that  were  identical  in  the  original  placode  will 
emerge  as  identical  in  this  relative  placode.  They  will,  however,  differ  from 
the  original  absolute  placode  by  a constant  factor.  The  cryptanalyst  repeats 
this  process  with  other  columns  having  a common  difference,  thus  reducing  as 
many  columns  as  have  such  a difference  all  to  the  same  relative  placode.  He 
then  solves  the  code.  If  it  is  a one-part  code,  he  can  quickly  determine  the 
constant  factor  and  obtain  the  absolute  placode;  if  it  is  a two-part  code,  this 
step  is  usually  neither  possible  nor  necessary. 

Take,  for  example,  the  following  five  cryptograms,  presumed  selected  from 
a day’s  intercepts.  Experience  has  taught  the  cryptanalyst  that  the  first  group 
of  each  message,  the  indicator,  designates  the  starting  point  for  the  additive 
sequence  contained  in  the  enemy  keybook.  Thus,  6218  means  to  begin  with 
the  group  on  page  62,  line  1,  column  8.  Three  of  the  messages  have  this 
indicator,  and  therefore  overlap  from  their  very  first  groups.  But  the  second 
message,  with  indicator  6216,  begins  in  column  6 of  the  same  line.  Conse- 
quently, its  third  group  would  have  been  enciphered  with  the  same  additive 
group  as  the  first  group  of  the  three  other  messages,  and  it  is  so  aligned.  Thesame 
procedure  aligns  the  message  that  has  indicator  62 1 7.  When  all  five  are  brought 
into  position,  each  column  of  encicode  groups  will  share  the  same  additive 
key.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  cryptanalyst  makes  his  runs  in  each  column  (temporarily  by-passing 
the  short  ones).  He  sets  out  the  results  in  ten  tables,  of  which  those  for  columns 
A and  E are :

6260  1169  4061  5480  8931

Table  A shows,  for  example,  that  6260  has  been  subtracted  from  itself,  leaving 
a difference  of  0000;  from  1169,  leaving  5909;  from  4061,  leaving  8801 ; and 
so  on.  (Subtraction,  like  the  addition,  is  noncarrying.)  Each  horizontal  line 
records  a run. 


A portion  of  the  difference  book  for  these  five  messages  would  show  that 
columns  A and  E share  the  differences  8801  and  5909.  It  would  also  show 
other  columns  with  differences  in  common:

Since  encicode  group  6260  produced  in  column  A the  difference  8801  that 
column  A shares  with  column  E,  the  cryptanalyst  subtracts  6260  from  every 
encicode  group  in  column  A.  He  does  the  same  with  7572  in  column  E.  Like- 
wise, 939 1 constitutes  a difference  common  to  columns  D,  I,  and  J and  permits 
them  to  be  reduced  to  equivalent  form  in  the  same  way— by  subtracting  in 
each  column  the  encicode  group  whose  run  produced  the  common  difference. 
These  five  reductions  yield  relative  placode  in  five  columns:

Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis

It  is  easy  to  see  the  numerous  repeated  relative-placode  groups — 0000, 
5909,  9391,  and  so  on.  Because  this  is  a contrived  example,  the  entire  message 
(except  for  the  two  short  columns)  can  be  reduced  to  this  relative  form.  In 
practice,  however,  it  is  not  always  possible  to  reduce  messages  fully,  and 
partial  solutions  result.  Accidental  common  differences  will  occur  occasion- 
ally. In  this  series,  1480  results  in  columns  F (4882-3402)  and  I (8426-7046). 
If  3402  were  used  as  the  relative  key  for  column  F,  it  would  produce  a false 
relative  placode  that  would  be  corrected  in  the  cryptanalysis  of  the  code  itself. 
Here,  however,  a preponderance  of  correct  common  differences  outweighs 
this  accident.  If  the  underlying  code  proved  to  be  one-part,  the  cryptanalyst 
would  discover  that  the  relative  placode  differs  from  the  absolute  placode, 
or  base,  by  a correction  factor  of  2371. 

The  thousands  of  repeated  subtractions,  first  to  find  differences  and  then 
to  reduce  to  relative  placode,  and  the  routine  compilation  of  the  difference 
tables,  furnish  an  almost  ideal  subject  for  the  mechanical  operation  of  the 
tabulators,  and  it  was  for  this  that  similar  machines  were  most  frequently 
used  in  cryptanalytic  offices  throughout  the  world.  In  addition  to  these  punched- 
card  machines,  Pers  z invented  or  adapted  several  special-purpose  devices. 

One  of  them  employed  translucent  paper  and  light  to  strip  a new  additive 
from  a base  code  that  had  been  previously  solved.  By  indicators  or  repetitions, 
the  cryptanalyst  lined  up  messages  so  that  a column  of  encicode  groups 
represented  encipherments  of  the  same  additive  group.  If  the  code  used  four- 
digit groups,  the  cryptanalyst  reached  for  a sheet  of  translucent  paper 
imprinted  with  a square  200  cells  by  200.  The  top  and  the  side  were  indexed 
with  coordinates  that  ran  from  00  to  99  twice.  Thus  the  four  cells  at  the  inter- 
sections of  the  two  side  coordinates  31  and  the  two  top  coordinates  50 
represented  the  codegroup  3150,  repeated  four  times. 

The  cryptanalyst’s  previous  solution  of  the  code  had  told  him  that  the 
most  frequent  placode  groups  were,  say,  6001,  5454,  5662,  and  7123.  (If  the 
code  were  two-part,  these  could  be  relative  placode;  if  one-part,  they  would 
probably  be  absolute.)  The  cryptanalyst  punched  holes  in  several  sheets  for 
all  five  placode  groups  at  each  one’s  four  locations.  He  inked  out  the  four 
cells  of  the  first  encicode  group  of  the  column  on  one  sheet,  of  the  second  on 
another,  and  so  on,  and  positioned  the  sheets  over  a source  of  light  so  that  the 
marked  encicode  cells  lay  one  atop  the  other.  The  brightest  spot  of  light  then 
represented  the  greatest  congregation  of  punched-out  placode  holes,  and  the 
numerical  difference  between  the  coordinates  of  this  light  spot  and  those  of  the 
dark  pile  of  encicode  cells  constituted  the  additive  for  that  column  of  encicode 
messages.  The  difference  was  usually  measured  on  the  top  sheet.  Thus,  if  the 
encicode  on  that  sheet  were  8808,  and  the  light  spot  were  at  6001,  the  additive 
for  that  column  would  be  2807,  and  the  placode  for  that  particular  encicode 
group  would  6001,  one  of  the  common  ones. 

The  method  is  analogous  to  determining  which  of  the  26  possible  decipher- 
ments of  a column  of  letters  in  Vigenere  (a  column  enciphered  by  a single 


444 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


keyletter)  is  correct  by  virtue  of  having  the  most  high-frequency  letters.  Often 
these  tests  are  made  with  alphabet  strips  on  which  the  high-frequency  letters 
are  printed  in  red;  the  strips  are  aligned  so  that  the  ciphertext  letters  stand 
under  one  another,  and  the  columns  out  to  the  right  are  scanned  to  see  which 
is  the  reddest  and  therefore  most  probably  the  correct  set  of  plaintext  letters. 
In  both  this  case  and  the  Pers  z device,  the  high-frequency  elements  that 
underlie  the  cipher  are  known  (plaintext  in  Vigenere,  placode  in  enciphered 
code),  and  the  cipher  alphabets  are  known  (normal  alphabet  in  Vigenere, 
ordinary  noncarrying  addition  in  enciphered  code).  Since  a strip  thousands 
of  cells  long  would  be  unwieldy,  the  Pers  z device  uses  two  dimensions 
instead  of  one,  but  it  must  repeat  its  coordinates  just  as  the  Vigenere  strip 
must  repeat  its  alphabet.  In  both  cases,  all  possible  solutions  are  tested 
simultaneously.  The  high-frequency  elements  concentrate  to  make  the 
brightest  spot  in  one,  the  reddest  column  in  the  other. 

These  Pers  z robots  helped  solve  codes  of  France  and  Italy,  both  of  which 
used  at  times  four-digit  codes  with  additive  superencipherments.  One  English 
code,  however,  remained  invulnerable,  because  the  40,000-group  length  of 
her  additive  key  prevented  enough  material  from  accumulating.  At  the  start 
of  World  War  II,  most  countries  probably  employed  the  additive  system  of 
enciphered  code  in  a hierarchy  of  codes  for  their  foreign  services.  Germany 
herself  did,  using  sometimes  a four-digit,  sometimes  a five-digit  code,  only 
her  additive  was  the  one-time  pad.  Despite  all  the  mechanical  help,  however, 
solution  of  most  codes  came  right  down  to  pencil-and-paper  work  by  indivi- 
dual cryptanalysts. 

Such  was  the  solution  of  the  superencipherment  of  the  Japanese  tsu 
diplomatic  code — the  columnar  transposition  with  blank  spaces  in  the  trans- 
position blocks  that  American  cryptanalysts  called  the  k9  transposition 
to  the  j 19  code.  The  Japanese  embassy  in  the  Soviet  Union  began  relying 
heavily  on  this  code  in  October  of  1941,  when  the  Soviet  government  moved 
its  capital  eastward  from  threatened  Moscow  to  Kuibyshev.  The  diplomats 
had  to  stay  close  to  the  seat  of  government,  and  the  Japanese  may  have 
junked  their  heavy  cipher  machine  instead  of  moving  it,  using  their  paper 
codes  instead.  Pers  z made  its  first  break  by  spotting  two  messages  which  had 
patches  of  identical  letters  separated  by  nonidentical  sections.  Deducing  that 
these  differing  portions  represented  the  same  placode  text,  the  cryptanalysts 
compared  the  two  messages  until,  in  a single  afternoon,  they  found  a trans- 
position and  blank  arrangement  that  yielded  the  same  texts  in  a form  that 
resembled  legitimate  codewords.  In  one  of  their  greatest  technical  successes, 
the  mathematical  cryptanalysts  cracked  the  approximately  30  transposition 
and  blank  patterns;  the  linguists  read  the  code,  and  the  subsequent  solutions 
provided  the  Germans  with  information  about  Russian  war  production  and 
army  activities. 

It  would,  of  course,  be  embarrassing  for  the  Germans  to  admit  that  they 
were  reading  the  code  messages  of  their  allies,  and  this  led  to  a touchy 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


445 


situation  early  in  1941.  Franz  von  Papen,  ambassador  to  Turkey,  reported  on 
February  4 that  the  Iraqi  minister  to  Turkey  had  told  him  “that  the  English 
can  plan  with  a full  knowledge  of  Italian  intentions  because  they  can  read  the 
Italian  cipher.”  Ernst  Woermann,  director  of  the  Foreign  Ministry’s  political 
department,  undertook  inquiries.  By  the  end  of  March  he  learned  from  Sel- 
chow  that  “the  Italians  make  use  of  three  groups  of  ciphers,  of  which  the 
first  group  is  easily  readable,  while  the  second  is  harder  to  solve.  Of  the  third 
group,  it  is  considered  probable,  though  not  certain,  that  into  that  complicated 
system  the  English  cannot  break.  Even  this  cipher  can  be  read  by  our  offices. 

. . . The  Rome-Bagdad  cipher  belongs  to  the  second  group.” 

Woermann  suggested  various  ways  of  getting  the  word  across  to  the 
Italians,  one  of  them  Germanically  subtle:  “We  could  say  that  the  informa- 
tion from  Ankara  led  us  to  try  our  hand  at  decrypting  a radiogram  from  the 
Rome-Bagdad  traffic,  and  we  have  just  succeeded.”  The  Italians  were  duly 
warned,  though  it  is  unknown  whether  the  hint  of  German  diplomat  Prince 
Otto  von  Bismarck  to  an  Italian  Foreign  Office  official  a few  months  later 
that  the  Germans  had  the  Italian  codes  (without  mentioning  the  English)  was 
how  it  was  done  or  whether  that  was  merely  an  indiscretion.  The  Italians  were 
the  despair  of  the  Germans  in  this,  as  in  everything  else;  they  did  not  change 
their  codes  and  Pers  z continued  to  read  them.  But  they  were  not  quite  as 
shiftless  as  the  Germans  thought.  Count  Galeazzo  Ciano,  the  Foreign 
Minister,  commented  in  his  diary  when  he  heard  that  the  Nazis  were 
reading  his  messages:  “This  is  good  to  know;  in  the  future,  they  will  also 
read  what  I want  them  to  read.” 

The  codes  of  small  countries  are  usually  simpler  to  solve  than  those  of 
large,  and  not  only  because  of  intrinsic  qualities  as  smaller  code  size  and  fewer 
codes  and  additive  tables.  Their  personnel  is  less  well  trained,  and  so  they 
often  ask  for  repeats  if,  as  happens  more  often  than  with  major  powers,  they 
cannot  decode  a message.  Moreover,  not  having  the  courier  services  or  com- 
munications of  larger  and  richer  countries,  they  cannot  get  new  codes  to 
distant  outposts  as  often  as  the  large  countries  and  so  continue  using  the 
older  codes  too  long.  While  their  messages  usually  do  not  contain  the  crucial 
portents  of  those  of  great  powers,  their  diplomats  are  sometimes  well  situated 
and  can  provide  information  of  value.  Yet  even  these  small  nations  sometimes 
seem  to  have  a feel  for  knowing  when  their  codes  are  broken.  “You  just  get 
to  a point  where  you  are  reading  a good  part  of  the  traffic  when  one  morning 
you  come  in  and  it’s  all  changed,”  said  Miss  Friedrichs. 

The  Pers  z solutions,  typed  up,  went  to  Selchow.  He  submitted  them  to 
the  state  secretary  of  the  Foreign  Office  before  Ribbentrop  became  Foreign 
Minister,  and  afterwards  to  both  the  state  secretary  and  the  Foreign  Minister’s 
office,  at  Ribbentrop’s  order.  Those  for  the  Fiihrer  were  marked  with  a green 
“F.”  He  did  not  always  see  them,  since  Ribbentrop  did  not  dare  give  him  bad 
news.  Those  that  he  did  see,  he  did  not  always  appreciate.  Across  the  face  of 
one  long  dispatch  that  gave  considerable  information  on  agricultural  conditions 


446 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


in  Russia,  which  bore  importantly  upon  military  possibilities,  Hitler  scrawled 
“Kann  nicht  bir  stimme”  (“This  cannot  be”).  Nazidom  preferred  its  own  lies 
and  propaganda  to  unpalatable  truths,  and  so,  as  Miss  Friedrichs  said,  “Even 
if  we  had  a plum,  it  was  not  considered  as  one.” 

In  April  of  1945,  the  American  front  engulfed  the  cryptanalysts  at  Burg- 
scheidungen  Castle  and  swept  past.  A few  days  later,  Haskell  Cleaves,  a Signal 
Corps  officer  from  Maine,  discovered  what  they  were  doing.  Headquarters 
sent  out  a mixed  commission  of  American,  British,  and  French  experts  to 
interrogate  them.  On  May  8,  while  the  world  was  celebrating  V-E  Day,  35  of 
them  were  flown  to  London  for  several  months  of  questioning;  among  their 
interrogators  was  a “Major  Brown,”  who  was  really  William  P.  Bundy,  later 
U.S.  Assistant  Secretary  of  State  for  Far  Eastern  Affairs.  For  the  cryptanalysts 
of  the  German  Foreign  Office,  the  war  had  ended. 

What  had  they  accomplished?  They  had  achieved  some  remarkable 
technical  successes,  and  for  some  that  was  enough.  Kunze  and  the  other 
mathematicians  usually  lost  interest  in  a problem  after  its  cryptanalytic 
difficulties  had  been  surmounted.  Even  the  codebreakers  who  were  interested 
in  their  influence  on  their  country’s  policy  could  rarely  learn  anything  about  it : 
the  diplomats  seldom  told  them,  and  Selchow  stood  between  them  and  the 
users.  Moreover,  the  effects  were  diffused  over  many  messages,  commingled 
with  other  sources  of  information,  distorted  by  Nazi  preconceptions,  so  that 
it  was  virtually  impossible  to  single  out  cryptanalyzed  information  as  critical 
in  a specific  event.  Finally,  and  most  important,  Germany  lost  the  war, 
reducing  all  the  Pers  z efforts  in  the  final  analysis  to  nullity.  “As  I am  accus- 
tomed to  say,”  said  Schauffler,  “a  bridge  builder  can  see  what  he  has  done  for 
his  countrymen,  but  we  cannot  tell  whether  our  life  was  worth  anything.” 

Yet  they  read  the  secret  communications  of  the  British  Empire,  Ireland, 
France,  Belgium,  Spain,  Portugal,  Italy,  the  Vatican,  Switzerland,  Yugoslavia, 
Greece,  Bulgaria,  Rumania,  Poland;  Egypt,  Ethiopia;  Turkey,  Iran,  China, 
Japan,  Manchukuo,  Thailand;  the  United  States,  Brazil,  Argentina,  Chile, 
Mexico,  Bolivia,  Colombia,  Ecuador,  Peru,  the  Dominican  Republic, 
Uruguay,  Venezuela.  Not  every  code  of  every  country  was  always  read,  but 
the  solution  of  the  codes  of  34  nations  of  the  earth  suggests  that,  whether  or 
not  the  the  Pers  z cryptanalysts’  life  was  “worth  anything,”  the  reckoning 
cannot  involve  whether  they  had  done  their  duty.  That  they  had. 

In  the  nightmare  totalitarian  jungle  that  was  Nazi  Germany,  the  bigwigs 
of  National  Socialism  consolidated  their  positions  by  building  up  personal 
power  structures.  Extra  power  could  come  from  the  knowledge  obtainable 
through  intercepting  communications.  Thus  it  was  that  a few  weeks  after 
Hitler  appointed  Hermann  Goring  as  Air  Minister  in  his  new  government  in 
1933,  the  fat  ex-air  ace  established  an  eight-man  unit  in  his  Air  Ministry  to  do 
as  much  intercepting  as  possible.  He  called  it  the  Forschungsamt  (“Research 
Office”),  but  its  research  was  highly  specialized.  Apparently  attached  to  the 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


447 


minister’s  office,  it  bore  no  relation  either  to  the  research  division  of  the 
Luftwaffe’s  technical  office  or  to  the  Luftwaffe’s  own  military  intercept  and 
cryptologic  unit. 

Goring  installed  the  Forschungsamt  in  a requisitioned  building  on  the 
Behrendstrasse,  Berlin,  but  moved  it  at  the  end  of  1933  to  the  Hotel  am 
Knie  in  the  suburb  of  Charlottenberg.  He  named  as  its  first  chief  an  old 
friend  and  loyal  party  member  named  Hans  Schimpf,  a former  naval  lieu- 
tenant who  had  once  served  as  liaison  between  the  Army  and  the  Navy 
cryptologic  organizations.  In  1934  the  unit  did  exactly  what  Goring  expected 
it  to  do  when  it  supplied  him  with  information  that  helped  him  win  Hitler  to 
his  side  in  the  first  great  power  struggle  of  the  Third  Reich — that  between 
Hitler’s  oldest  friend  and  closest  associate  in  the  Nazi  movement,  the  homo- 
sexual Ernst  Roehm,  on  the  one  hand,  and  Goring,  Heinrich  Himmler,  head 
of  the  S.S.  and  the  Gestapo,  and  the  Junkers  on  the  other.  Roehm  was  shot, 
and  soon  thereafter  Schimpf  suffered  the  same  fate,  presumably  because  he 
had  done  his  job  so  well  that  he  knew  too  much.  Goring  replaced  him  with 
Prince  Christoph  of  Hesse,  younger  brother  of  Prince  Philip  of  Hesse,  one  of 
Goring’s  friends  since  the  late  1920s.  Christoph,  then  in  his  mid-thirties,  was 
the  fourth  and  youngest  son  of  the  Landgrave  of  Hesse,  former  ruler  of  that 
principality  and  a member  of  one  of  the  oldest  traceable  families  in  Christen- 
dom (to  Charlemagne).  Christoph  became  a ministerial  director  in  the  Air 
Ministry  and  also  had  the  title  of  Oberfiihrer  of  the  S.S.  on  the  staff  of  the 
S.S.  Reichsfiihrer,  who  was  Himmler.  He  died  in  Italy  in  1941. 

The  Forschungsamt  tapped  telephones,  opened  letters,  solved  encoded 
telegrams.  Its  reports  were  called  Braune  Blatter  (“Brown  Sheets”).  A typical 
one,  of  March  19,  1945,  which  was  passed  to  the  economic  division  of  the 
armed  forces,  reported  that  on  March  14  the  Swiss  political  department 
informed  the  Swiss  embassy  in  Lisbon  about  an  agreement  reached  with  the 
Allies  concerning  railroad  operations  from  southern  France.  The  Forschungs- 
amt also  recorded  the  conversations  of  Goring  and  Hitler.  These  were  passed 
to  the  appropriate  government  department  for  action  or  reference,  if  neces- 
sary. In  its  most  famous  case,  it  transcribed  27  conversations  from  Goring’s 
office  with  various  officials  in  Rome  and  Vienna  that  settled  Austria’s  fate  in 
the  hours  before  the  Anschluss.  Ironically,  one  of  those  whose  subservient 
words  to  an  overjoyed  Hitler  were  recorded  for  posterity  was  Prince  Philip, 
emissary  of  the  Fiihrer  and  brother  of  the  chief  eavesdropper. 

Christoph’s  membership  in  the  S.S.,  or  Schutzstaffel  (“Protection  Staff”), 
the  notorious  blackshirted  strong  arm  of  the  Nazi  party,  pointed  to  a close 
relationship  between  the  Forschungsamt  and  the  S.D.,  or  Sicherheitsdienst 
(“Security  Service”),  the  branch  of  the  S.S.  that  served  as  the  ideological 
watchdog  for  the  Nazis.  The  S.D.,  for  example,  determined  who  voted  the 
wrong  way  in  German  plebiscites  by  numbering  the  back  of  the  ballots  with 
milk,  a simple  but  effective  secret  ink.  Its  efforts  were  primarily  internal,  and 
since  private  citizens,  even  conspirators,  seldom  use  complicated  code  or

cipher  systems,  its  cryptanalytic  organization — if  it  even  had  one — was  small 
and  nameless.  This  is  not  to  say  that  the  S.D.  was  not  interested  in  other 
people’s  conversations:  it  probably  did  its  share  of  telephone  tapping  and 
mail  opening. 

After  1936,  the  S.D.  extended  its  watchdog  duties  from  just  the  party  to 
the  government  as  well,  with  a domestic  branch  and  a foreign  branch  that 
would  nullify  dangers  before  they  could  be  launched  against  the  sacred  soil  of 
the  German  Reich.  Probably  the  S.D.  also  broadened  its  communications 
activities  somewhat.  It  filched  a diplomatic  telegram  here  and  there,  and 
listened  in  to  diplomatic  telephone  conversations,  even  one,  on  May  7,  1940, 
between  Prime  Minister  Neville  Chamberlain  of  Britain  and  Premier  Paul 
Reynaud  of  France — Chamberlain  and  Reynaud  could  certainly  be  considered 
enemies  of  Germany  and  the  Nazi  party.  But  the  S.D.  probably  got  most  of 
the  external  communications  intelligence  that  it  needed  from  the  Forschungs- 
amt, which  was  quite  as  interested  as  the  S.D.  in  preserving  the  Nazi  regime. 

Himmler  headed  the  S.S.  as  a party  official;  as  a government  official  he 
headed  the  two  Reich  police  organizations:  the  Gestapo,  which  handled 
political  crimes,  and  the  Kripo,  or  Kriminalpolizei,  which  dealt  with  ordinary 
crimes.  Both  had  communication  intelligence  sections,  but,  as  with  the  S.D., 
these  probably  concentrated  primarily  on  telephones  and  mail  and  had  but 
little  cryptanalysis  to  do. 

In  1939,  the  party  and  government  police  organizations  were  merged  as  the 
R.S.H.A.,  the  Reichssicherheitshauptamt  (“Reich  Central  Security  Office”). 
The  Gestapo  became  Amt  IV  of  the  R.S.H.A.,  the  Kripo  Amt  V.  The  govern- 
ment domestic  watchdog  branch  of  the  S.D.  evolved  into  the  R.S.H.A.  Amt 
III,  Domestic  Intelligence,  and  the  foreign  branch  into  Amt  VI,  Foreign  In- 
telligence. Amt  VI  was  charged  with  the  production  of  secret  information 
about  enemy  countries. 

It  apparently  directed  its  thoughts  mainly  to  the  more  traditional  methods 
of  gathering  such  intelligence.  But  shortly  after  the  Anschluss,  Walter 
Schellenberg,  a young  S.D.  official,  seized  the  files  of  the  Austrian  secret 
service  and  found  that  among  the  most  interesting  documents  were  those  on 
cryptanalysis.  This  find  may  have  soon  thereafter  recalled  to  the  mind  of 
Wilhelm  Hottl,  a youthful  Austrian  staff  member  of  the  new  R.S.H.A.,  the 
World  War  I deeds  of  the  Austro-Hungarian  cryptanalysts,  which  General 
Max  Ronge  had  detailed  in  an  exciting  book.  Hottl  discovered  that  General 
Andreas  FigI,  former  head  of  the  Austrian  Dechiffrierdienst,  had  been 
arrested  by  the  Gestapo  in  1938.  Hottl  got  Heinz  lost,  then  head  of  Amt  VI, 
to  free  Figl  and  to  install  him  as  an  instructor  in  cryptology  in  a villa  in  the 
Wannsee  section  of  Berlin.  Here  he  passed  on  his  experience  to  a new  genera- 
tion. 

But  such  training  takes  time,  and  any  intelligence  that  the  R.S.H.A. 
obtained  from  communications  continued  to  come  to  it  from  other  sources. 
It  seized  an  occasional  plaintext  telegram  and  somehow  acquired  a one-part

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Spanish  code  and  used  it  to  read  intercepts.  It  also  was  granted  what  must 
have  been  the  first  opportunity  in  history  to  get  codes  wholesale.  Yamato 
Ominata,  Japan’s  intelligence  chief  in  Europe,  offered  to  deliver  the  Yugoslav 
general  staff  and  Turkish,  Vatican,  Portuguese,  and  Brazilian  codes  for 
28,000  Swiss  crowns,  or  about  $20,000.  The  offer  may  well  have  been  accepted, 
for  all  those  codes  were  read  at  one  time  or  another  by  various  German 
agencies. 

In  addition,  the  R.S.H.A.  depended  upon  the  military  and  the  For- 
schungsamt  for  communications  intelligence.  Thus,  in  the  autumn  of  1941, 
Schellenberg,  who  had  become  deputy  chief  of  Amt  VI,  asked  Reinhard 
Heydrich,  head  of  the  whole  R.S.H.A.,  to  contact  both  the  Forschungsamt 
and  the  military.  Schellenberg  wanted  them  to  concentrate  their  intercept 
posts  and  cryptanalysts  on  Vichy  and  Belgrade  traffic  for  some  information 
he  needed.  At  about  the  same  time,  Heydrich  called  the  chief  of  the  Wehr- 
macht  signal  organization  and  asked  him  to  send  Schellenberg  any  informa- 
tion about  American-Japanese  negotiations  that  he  might  obtain. 

Himmler  disliked  such  dependency  and  in  March  of  1942  he  sent  Schellen- 
berg to  Goring’s  beautiful  country  house,  Karinhalle,  to  urge  that  the  For- 
schungsamt  be  incorporated  into  Amt  VI.  Goring  greeted  him  in  a Roman 
outfit,  toga,  sandals,  and  all,  carrying  his  Reichmarschal’s  baton,  and,  after 
hearing  Schellenberg,  said  vaguely,  “Well,  I will  have  a word  about  it  with 
Himmler.”  Nothing  happened,  of  course,  and  Schellenberg,  who  at  this  time 
became  head  of  Amt  VI,  set  up  a well-funded  department,  to  carry  out 
research  in  secret  communications  including  invisible  inks  and  microfilms  as 
well  as  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis.  Figl  may  well  have  been  the  nucleus 
of  this  group.  It  may  have  provided  the  digraphic  cipher— ten  tables  26  x 26, 
one  of  which  was  selected  to  encipher  each  message — that  one  R.S.H.A.  radio 
net  was  using  much  later  in  the  war.  This  system  may  have  been  adapted  from 
the  Army,  which  at  one  time  used  digraphic  substitution  as  a field  cipher.  For 
internal  communications,  the  R.S.H.A.  used  cipher  machines  supplied  by 
the  military. 

The  new  department  did  not,  in  any  event,  produce  a great  deal  of  com- 
munications intelligence,  for  Schellenberg  continued  to  get  most  of  his  from 
the  outside.  Starting  in  1942,  he  said,  “Every  three  weeks  or  so  I gave  a dinner 
party  at  my  home  where  the  technical  heads  of  the  three  services,  Defense 
Ministry,  Post  Office  [which  unscrambled  transatlantic  telephone  conversa- 
tions], and  Research  Stations  [Forschungsamt]  discussed  new  developments 
and  helped  each  other  with  their  problems.*  These  meetings  were  perhaps 
more  than  any  other  single  factor  responsible  for  the  high  standard  of  the 
scientific  and  technical  side  of  my  service.  It  was  the  cooperation  and  interest 

* No  Pers  z representative  appears  to  have  attended — probably  a reflection  of  the  high- 
level  personal  dislikes  and  power  struggles  between  Goring  and  Himmler  on  the  one  hand 
and  Ribbentrop  and  the  military  on  the  other.  At  one  point  Goring  tried  to  bring  Pers  z 
within  the  ambit  of  the  Forschungsamt.

which  these  people  showed  to  me  personally  which  made  most  of  my  success 
in  Secret  Service  operations  possible” — an  unexampled  acknowledgment  of 
indebtedness  to  communications  intelligence  by  a cloak-and-dagger  man. 

The  R.S.H.A.  repaid  some  of  this  generous  help  with  the  products  of  the 
greatest  spy  coup  of  World  War  II — Operation  Cicero.  “Cicero”  was  Elyesa 
Bazna,  an  Albanian  working  in  Ankara  as  the  valet  to  Sir  Hughe  Knatchbull- 
Hugessen,  British  ambassador  to  neutral  Turkey.  Bazna  had  taken  wax

impressions  of  the  keys  to  the  black  dispatch  box  which  Sir  Hughe  kept  beside 
his  bed  for  the  secret  papers  that  he  liked  to  pore  over  late  at  night.  The  valet 
would  open  the  box,  photograph  the  documents,  and  sell  the  rolls  of  film  to 
the  R.S.H.A.  agent  in  Turkey,  L.  C.  Moyzisch.  Cicero  received  £15,000  a 
roll — in  counterfeit  notes. 

The  documents  consisted  largely  of  cables  to  Sir  Hughe.  They  were  of  the 
highest  importance — reports  of  Stalin-Roosevelt-Churchill  conversations,  for 
example.  But  when  this  information  began  streaming  into  Berlin  in  November 
and  December,  1943,  Hitler  and  other  top  officials  refused  to  believe  that  it 
was  genuine.  “Too  good  to  be  true,”  Ribbentrop  told  Moyzisch.  The  fact  is 
that  he  did  not  want  to  read  therein  the  impending  doom  of  the  German  Reich.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  messages,  which  bore  date-time  notations,  could  help  in  breaking  the 
British  diplomatic  codes,  and  though  Pers  z would  seem  to  have  been  the 
logical  recipient,  Schellenberg  gave  the  photographs  to  his  communications- 
intelligence  friends  in  the  military.  They  cooperated  fairly  closely  with  Pers  z, 
however,  and  they  probably  passed  the  material  to  it.  Pers  z may  also  have 
gotten  copies  from  Ribbentrop.  Kunze  and  Paschke  both  saw  Cicero  docu- 
ments and  were  unimpressed.  For  the  British  were  by  then  superenciphering 
their  most  secret  messages  in  a one-time  pad.  Though  the  Cicero  messages 
may  have  contributed  to  the  solution  of  some  lesser  British  systems  and  so 
helped  produce  some  minor  information,  they  could  not  make  possible  the 
recovery  of  the  one-time  keys  of  any  other  messages.  Operation  Cicero, 
so  complete  a success  in  one  sense,  was  thus  an  almost  total  failure  in 
another. 

At  about  this  time,  Hottl,  the  young  man  who  had  discovered  Figl,  be- 
came, at  age  28,  the  head  of  Amt  VI  e — the  Amt  VI  section  for  southeast 
Europe.  He  soon  grew  friendly  with  Hungarian  Army  intelligence,  whose  chief 
one  day  showed  off  his  communications-intelligence  unit.  The  Hungarians 
did  indeed  have  a fine  organization,  and  it  very  much  impressed  Hottl.  He 
thought  that  it  did  relatively  more  with  its  poor  resources  than  did  Pers  z,  the 
Forschungsamt,  the  German  military  cryptanalysts,  and  the  police  eaves- 
droppers all  put  together.  In  the  middle  of  1944,  he  convinced  the  pro-Nazi 
Hungarian  Premier,  Andor  Sztojay,  to  have  the  unit  furnish  him  with  its 
results.  The  unit’s  commander,  Major  Bibo,  who  lived  only  for  his  work, 
agreed  to  concentrate  on  the  traffic  that  Hottl  wanted  when  Hottl  promised 
him  more  men,  better  equipment,  and  extra  money. 

Hottl  went  from  room  to  room  in  Bibo’s  offices  and  picked  out  the  choicest 
of  the  copious  solutions.  A few  days  later,  he  laid  the  sheaf  before  Schellen- 
berg and  said:  “Please  read  this,  and  if  you  would  like  to  have  it  regularly, 
give  me  a credit  for  the  first  100,000  Swiss  francs.”  But  Schellenberg  feared 
that  Hitler,  who  distrusted  the  Hungarians  because  of  their  marked  lack  of 
enthusiasm  for  being  an  Axis  partner,  would  not  like  the  idea  if  he  heard  of  it. 
He  gave  Hottl  only  a nominal  sum.  But  Hottl  wangled  the  francs  out  of  the 
R.S.H.A.  financial  wizard,  Friedrich  Schwend — not  too  difficult  a task,  since 
the  money  was  bogus. 

Within  six  months,  the  unit  exceeded  even  Hottl’s  sanguine  hopes  by  read- 
ing a goodly  portion  of  the  secret  radiograms  of  embassies  in  Moscow.  Figl 
seems  to  have  joined  it  and  become  one  of  its  star  cryptanalysts,  performing 
some  minor  miracles  in  his  room  with  pots  of  black  coffee  and  packs  of 
cigarettes  whenever  the  unit  was  stumped.  Bibo’s  interceptors  and  crypt- 
analysts had  become  the  R.S.H.A.’s  first  major  source  of  its  own  of  foreign 
communications  intelligence.  It  could  read  some  American  and  British 
messages,  especially  in  1945,  when  it  acquired  a cryptanalyst  “who  could  sift 
the  unimportant  from  the  important  with  the  sureness  of  a sleep-walker.”  It 
read  almost  all  the  radio  traffic  of  the  Turkish  embassy,  learning  that  Stalin 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


453 


deeply  suspected  his  Anglo-American  allies  and  feared  that  they  might  con- 
clude a separate  peace  with  Germany.  The  reports  of  the  Turkish  military 
attache,  Hottl  was  told  by  General  Alfred  Jodi,  chief  of  the  Wehrmacht 
operations  staff,  contained  the  most  valuable  information  about  Russia  that 
the  high  command  then  had.  By  this  time,  about  the  end  of  1 944,  the  advancing 
Russians  forced  the  unit  to  retreat  from  Budapest  to  the  Odenburg  hills  and, 
three  months  later,  to  an  Alpine  redoubt.  These  disruptions  did  not  choke  off 
the  flow  of  intelligence,  which  ended  only  when  the  war  did. 

“I  do  not  want  to  exaggerate  the  importance  of  what  we  achieved, 
although  in  this  one  year  of  my  collaboration  with  the  Hungarians  there  were 
at  least  a hundred  successes  such  as  seldom  fall  to  the  lot  of  a Secret  Service 
working  in  the  ordinary  ways,”  Hottl  wrote.  His  impressive  tribute,  which 
independently  seconds  the  praise  that  Schellenberg  offered  to  other  crypt- 
analysts, confirms  the  overwhelming  supremacy  that  communications 
intelligence  attained  in  both  quantity  and  quality  over  almost  any  other 
form  of  secret  intelligence  in  World  War  II. 

Long  before  the  S.D.  or  the  R.S.H.A.  came  into  existence,  a military 
organization  handled  Germany’s  intelligence  and  counterespionage  func- 
tions. This  was  the  Abwehr.  The  name  means  “counterespionage,”  and  that 
was  the  original  function  of  the  six-officer  Abwehr  unit  permitted  Germany 
under  the  1919  Treaty  of  Versailles.  As  the  German  Army  grew,  so  did  the 
Abwehr’s  functions,  until  it  encompassed  foreign  “counter”  intelligence  and 
standard  military  intelligence.  The  name,  however,  stuck. 

In  1934,  Hitler  merged  the  Army,  Navy,  and  Air  Force  into  the  Wehr- 
macht, with  a single  general  staff  for  all  the  armed  forces— the  O.K.W.,  or 
Oberkommando  der  Wehrmacht.  To  this  the  Abwehr  was  attached,  and  in 
1935  a naval  officer,  Admiral  Wilhelm  Canaris,  took  over  as  Abwehr  chief. 
He  was  a sensitive,  white-haired,  mufti-garbed,  mysterious  personage.  He 
hated  Hitler,  and  his  organization  abominated  the  Nazi-spawned  S.D.  and 
R.S.H.A.  that  reduplicated  Abwehr  functions.  The  feeling  was  reciprocated, 
but  the  rivals  reached  an  uneasy  truce  in  which  the  Abwehr  handled  military 
matters  and  the  others  nonmilitary.  However,  in  February  of  1944,  Hitler 
dissolved  the  Abwehr  headquarters  and  merged  it  into  the  R.S.H.A.,  where  it 
became  Amt  VI/Mil  under  Schellenberg. 

The  Abwehr  had  three  headquarters  sections:  Abwehr  I,  for  secret  intelli- 
gence, whose  Group  G produced  invisible  inks  and  forged  passports  and  other 
documents  for  secret  agents,  and  whose  Group  i maintained  wireless  contact 
with  Abwehr  secret  agents;  Abwehr  II,  for  sabotage  and  special  duties; 
Abwehr  III,  counterespionage,  whose  Group  n,  added  in  wartime,  secured 
communications  organizations.  Among  the  Abwehr  radio  stations  for  agent 
contact  were  those  at  Hamburg,  where  20  transmitters  were  installed  in 
separate  concrete  dugouts  in  an  open  field  and  were  remote-controlled  from 
the  receiving  center  a few  kilometers  away,  and  at  Ulm,  where  19  transmitters

radioed  agents  from  a small  wooden  building  constructed  in  1938  on  a hill 
just  outside  the  city. 

The  Abwehr  did  not  have  its  own  codebreakers.  For  such  intelligence 
it  relied,  as  part  of  the  Wehrmacht,  upon  the  military  cryptanalytic 
agencies. 

Of  these  there  were  four:  one  in  the  Oberkommando  der  Wehrmacht  for 
the  armed  forces  as  a whole,  and  one  each  for  the  high  commands  of  the 
Army  (O.K.H.,  or  Oberkommando  des  Heeres),  the  Navy  (O.K.M.,  or 
Oberkommando  der  Kriegsmarine),  and  the  Air  Force  (O.K.L.,  or  Ober- 
kommando der  Luftwaffe).  They  traced  back  to  an  intercept  and  cryptanalytic 
service  established  in  the  Army  in  1919  by  one  Lieutenant  Colonel  Buschen- 
hagen,  who  had  worked  in  the  intercept  service  in  the  war.  He  called  it  the 
“Volunteer  Evaluation  Office”  and  installed  it  on  the  Friedrichstrasse.  In 
February  of  1920,  its  twelve-man  staff  moved  to  the  Defense  Ministry  Build- 
ing on  the  Bendlerstrasse,  where  it  became  Group  II  of  the  Abwehr.  Since 
the  unit’s  work  was  much  more  closely  allied  with  communications,  however, 
it  reverted  a few  years  later  to  the  administrative  control  of  the  chief  of  signal 
troops. 

Even  before  that,  it  had  moved  out  to  nearby  Grunewald,  disguising  itself 
as  a newspaper  translation  and  study  group  to  avoid  the  Inter-Allied  Military 
Control  Commissions,  which  had  proscribed  intercept  and  codebreaking 
activities  for  the  postwar  German  Army  and  had  very  nearly  discovered  the 
unit’s  real  activity.  The  unit  further  evaded  both  the  letter  of  the  Commis- 
sions’ directives  and  the  spirit  of  the  disarmament  clauses  of  the  Versailles 
Treaty  when  it  began  to  prepare  itself  for  any  sudden  demand  for  cryptan- 
alysts that  might  arise— as  in  the  case  of  a war.  On  October  31,  1921,  the 
Army  high  command  sent  out  a secret  circular: 

In  order  to  cultivate  and  develop  further  the  study  of  cryptography  and  the 
utilization  of  the  results  of  the  Intercept  Service  [Horchdienstes],  it  is  necessary 
to  train  suitable  officers  for  this  special  service  branch. 

Such  officers  are  required  to  have  a good  knowledge  of  radio  technique  and 
mathematics,  as  well  as  geography,  and  some  knowledge  of  a language  (English, 
French,  or  an  Eastern  language). 

The  officers  concerned  are  not  to  be  detached.  At  first  it  is  intended  that 
instruction  will  be  by  correspondence  only,  using  problems  given  by  the  Army 
command  for  the  winter  half-year. 

Officers  who  distinguish  themselves  by  especially  good  performance  will  be 
considered  for  service  in  evaluation  stations  of  the  higher  commands  and  of  the 
Army  command ; in  addition  there  are  expected  to  be  prizes  in  the  form  of  books 
on  special  branches  of  science. 

The  communications-intelligence  unit  stepped  up  its  activities  as  Allied 
supervision  waned.  Part  of  its  work  consisted  of  picking  up  press  association 
messages  and  news  broadcasts  and  distributing  a digest  of  them  to  government 
officials.  By  1926,  it  had  intercept  stations  in  six  major  cities  of  Germany.  In 


455 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 

1928,  it  began  following  the  military  maneuvers  in  which  neighboring  coun- 
tries were  once  again  engaging.  It  sneaked  its  intercept  units  into  the  de- 
militarized zone  along  the  Rhine  by  disguising  them  as  technicians  for  the 
German  broadcasting  or  postal  organizations.  Much  of  its  success  resulted 
from  traffic  analysis— in  35  of  the  52  major  maneuvers  between  1931  and 
1937,  the  foreign  forces  were  reconstructed  completely.  But  it  also  solved 
some  cipher  systems. 

When  in  1934,  Hitler  pointed  Germany  toward  its  eventual  war  of  revenge 
and  conquest,  he  swelled  the  ranks  of  the  armed  forces  and  intensified  military 
activities.  But  though  the  cryptologic  agencies  likewise  grew  in  size,  they  did 
not  necessarily  grow  in  effectiveness.  There  were  too  few  specialists  in  this 
recondite  field  to  fill  the  need  created  by  the  proliferating  military  and  party 
organizations.  Some  of  the  Army  cryptanalysts  were  siphoned  off  to  serve  in  the 
Forschungsamt,  others,  the  Luftwaffe.  Some  of  the  intercept  people  moved 
over  to  Josef  Goebbels’  Ministry  of  Propaganda,  where  their  news-eaves- 
dropping could  help.  About  1937,  the  O.K.W.  created  its  own  communica- 
tions and  cryptologic  staff,  thereby  draining  off  more  of  the  experts  and 
further  splintering  the  effort  in  the  field.  These  new  agencies  were  staffed  by 
World  War  I veterans  who  were  now  rejoining  the  German  Army;  most  had 
been  officers  in  the  signal  corps  but  had  no  great  experience  in  or  aptitude  for 
intercept  or  cryptologic  work.  By  mid-1939,  the  German  communications- 
intelligence  services  had  18  times  as  many  people  in  them  as  they  had  had  in 
1932,  but  useful  results  had  in  no  way  kept  pace. 

Six  days  before  Hitler  fell  upon  Poland,  Major  General  Erich  Fellgiebel, 
52,  who  had  been  in  communications  since  he  joined  a telegraph  battalion 
upon  enlisting  in  1905,  was  named  head  of  the  O.K.W.  communications 
organization.  His  title  was  Chef,  Wehrmachtnachrichtenverbindungen 
(“Chief,  Armed  Forces  Signal  Communications”),  or  Chef  W.N.V.  His 
superior  was  the  O.K.W.  chief,  Field  Marshal  Wilhelm  Keitel,  whose  only 
superior  was  Hitler.  Keitel  wrote  in  Fellgiebel's  fitness  reports:  In  his  field  a 
pronounced  leader  type  with  foresight,  a gift  for  organization,  full  energy  and 
dedication.  ...  In  his  attitude  towards  National  Socialism  an  inclination  to 
unconsidered  overcriticism.  . . .”  The  W.N.V.  supervised  communications, 
including  communications  security,  and  intercept  operations;*  it  served  as  a 
kind  of  staff,  an  advisor  and  controller,  for  the  service  branches  that  largely 
operated  the  communications  and  intercept  networks  for  the  Army,  Navy, 
and  Air  Force,  much  as  the  O.K.W.  itself  advised  and  directed  the  service 
commands. 

Under  the  Chef  W.N.V.  came  the  Amtsgruppe  W.N.V.  Its  chief  was 
Major  General  Fritz  Thiele,  48,  a close  colleague  of  Fellgiebel's  who  had 
previously  headed  the  O.K.H.  communications  and  intercept  organization. 
He  became  Chef,  Amtsgruppe  W.N.V.  the  day  the  war  began.  The  unit 

* The  term  “Nachrichten”  reflects  this,  since  it  means  not  only  “communications  or 
“signals”  but  also  “intelligence.”  In  nonmilitary  contexts,  it  means  “news”  or  ‘ information. 


456 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


comprised  radio  and  wire  branches,  which  maintained  communications 
between  the  headquarters  of  the  three  armed  forces  high  commands,  a 
technical  equipment  office,  an  administrative  office,  and  the  Chiffrierabteilung 
(“Cipher  Office”),  usually  abbreviated  “Chi.”  Colonel  Siegfried  Kempf 
assumed  command  of  Chi  on  the  same  day  that  Fellgiebel  became  Chef 
W.N.V.  Then  43,  he  was  a career  communications  officer,  a martinet  disliked 
by  his  subordinates.  He  was  succeeded  in  October,  1943,  by  Colonel  Hugo 
Kettler,  48,  who  had  had  considerable  intercept  experience  and  who  brought 
out  the  best  in  his  men. 

In  1944,  the  Chiffrierabteilung  was  divided  into  eight  groups.  Four  came 
directly  under  Kettler;  the  other  four  were  combined  into  two  supergroups, 
Gruppen  II  and  III  into  Hauptgruppe  a for  cryptography,  Gruppen  IV  and 
V into  Hauptgruppe  b for  cryptanalysis,  each  with  its  own  head  who  reported 
to  Kettler.  This  was  the  organization: 

Gruppe  Z (Zentralgruppe):  personnel;  pay,  administration;  office  space 
and  furnishings;  Nazi  ideological  supervision. 

Gruppe  I:  Organization  and  Control.  Referat  la:  direction  of  the  inter- 
national monitoring  service  (Chi  had  intercept  posts  in  Madrid  and 
Seville  as  well  as  Lorrach  and  Tennenlohe,  with  main  posts  in  Lauf 
and  Treuenbrietzen).  Referat  lb:  study  of  foreign  communications 
systems.  Referat  Ic:  provision  of  teletype  communications  for  Chi  and 
R.S.H.A./VI/Mil  (former  Abwehr). 

Gruppe  II:  Development  of  German  Cipher  Methods  and  Control  of 
Their  (Jse.  Referat  I la:  camouflage  methods  for  telegraph  and  radio 
messages;  intercept  and  wiretapping  techniques;  cryptographic  policy; 
supervision  of  cipher  employment;  cryptographic  compromises. 
Referat  lib:  development  of  German  cipher  systems  (camouflage 
methods,  secret  writing,  secret  telephony);  supervision  of  and  instruc- 
tion in  cipher  production.  Referat  lie:  cryptographic  systems  for  radio 
agents. 

Gruppe  III:  Cipher  Supply.  Control  of  production,  printing,  and  distribu-

In  addition  to  these  eight  sections,  a working  committee  for  the  testing  of 
German  cryptographic  security  reported  directly  to  Kettler,  and  half  a dozen 
intercept  companies  worked  for  Chi.  The  office  was  expected  to  maintain 
liaison  with  the  communications  units  of  the  Army,  Navy,  and  Air  Force; 
with  the  chief  of  army  equipment  and  commander  of  the  replacement  army, 
under  whom  there  was  an  inspector  of  signal  troops;  with  the  R.S.H.A.,  the 
Foreign  Office,  the  Propaganda,  Post,  Air,  Trade,  and  War  Production 
ministries  and,  of  course,  with  the  party. 

(By  1945,  the  Chiffrierabteilung  had  been  reorganized  into  seven  groups, 
with  functions  apparently  as  follows:  Gruppe  Z,  administration;  Gruppe  I, 
organization  and  control;  Gruppe  II,  Chi-Nachrichten;  Gruppe  III,  broad- 
cast and  press  interception;  Gruppe  IV,  cryptanalysis;  Gruppe  V,  teletype  for 
Chi  and  R.S.H.A./VI/Mil;  Gruppe  X,  evaluation,  distribution  and  informa- 
tion services.  This  downgrading  of  cryptanalysis  and  upgrading  of  the  non- 
cryptanalytic  results  may  reflect  a drop  in  the  cryptanalytic  results  late  in 
the  war.) 

Chief  of  Hauptgruppe  b,  in  which  the  cryptanalytic  functions  reposed,  was 
Ministerial  Counselor  Wilhelm  Fenner,  48  when  the  war  started.  A German 
born  and  raised  in  St.  Petersburg,  he  had  headed  German  military  crypt- 
analysis since  1922.  He  was  a brilliant  organizer  who  oversaw  the  expansion 
of  the  group  from  a handful  to  more  than  1 50,  but  he  handicapped  himself  by 
his  egocentricity  and  by  his  superciliousness  with  regard  to  the  noncryptanalytic 
aspects  of  communications  intelligence.  His  right-hand  man  was  a Russian 
emigrant,  Professor  Novopaschenny,  who  under  the  Czar  had  been  attached  to 
an  astronomical  observatory  in  Pulkovo,  outside  St.  Peterbsurg.  He  developed 
much  of  the  technical  aspects  of  the  work,  but  seems  to  have  held  only 
a relatively  subordinate  post  as  a chief  cryptanalyst  in  one  of  the  national 
offices,  apparently  Referat  V 9,  which  was  probably  Russia.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Head  of  Analytical  Cryptanalysis  (Gruppe  IV)  was  Dr.  Erich  Hiittenhain, 
who  also  directed  that  group’s  instructional  activity  (Referat  IVd).  Referat 
lVa,  which  tested  German  cryptosystems,  frequently  with  mathematical  tools 
to  calculate  theoretical  limits  of  security  and  to  find  improvements,  was 
headed  by  mathematician  Dr.  Karl  Stein,  who  held  the  rank  of  lieutenant, 
surprisingly  low  for  so  lofty  a position.  Referat  IVb,  headed  by  Engineer 
Wilhelm  Rotscheidt,  used  tabulating  machines  and  special-purpose  devices.  It 
invented  the  prototype  of  the  translucent-sheet-and-light  device  used  by  Pers 
z to  strip  additives  from  a known  code.  The  unit  first  worked  out  the  device 
for  two-digit  codes  and  then  extended  it  to  four.  Instead  of  punching  out 
holes  corresponding  to  the  most  frequent  groups,  however,  Referat  IVb 
marked  them  with  small  crosshatched  disks,  and  looked,  not  for  the  brightest 
spot,  but  for  the  darkest.  Stein’s  mathematicians  extensively  investigated  the 
question  of  how  a codegroup  stock  could  be  constructed  so  that  this  method 
would  not  work  against  it.  Referat  IVc's  chief  was  Professor  Dr.  Wolfgang 
Franz,  and  Ministerial  Counselor  Dr.  Victor  Wendland  was  head  of  Gruppe  V 
(Practical  Cryptanalysis)  and  so  Fenner’s  immediate  subordinate. 

Early  in  the  war,  the  O.K.W.  cryptanalysts  worked  in  a former  town  house 
on  one  of  the  streets  that  run  off  the  Tirpitzufer,  not  far  from  O.K.W.  head- 
quarters on  the  Bendlerstrasse.  About  1943  they  moved  to  much  larger  quar- 
ters in  a modern  semicircular  concrete  office  building  at  56  Potsdamerstrasse 
called  the  Haus  des  Fremdenverkehr — a name  that  gave  rise  to  many  bad 
jokes  because  “fremdenverkehr”  (“tourist  traffic”)  is  German  slang  for 
“fornication.” 

On  July  21,  1944,  Fellgiebel’s  sudden  removal  from  command  rocked  the 
whole  W.N.V.  It  seemed  to  be  connected  with  the  bomb  attempt  on  Hitler’s 
life  of  the  day  before — and  it  was.  Fellgiebel,  whose  anti-Nazi  proclivities  had 
been  noted  in  his  fitness  report  by  Keitel,  had  in  fact  been  a key  figure  in  the 
plot.  He  was  replaced  by  Thiele,  who  became  head  of  both  the  O.K.W.  and 
the  O.K.H.  agencies.  He  served  for  exactly  a month.  Then  he  was  arrested  as 
a co-conspirator,  his  personnel  file  crossed  out  with  a giant  X,  and  the  entry 
made  under  his  name,  “stricken  from  the  honor  roll  of  the  German  Army  and 
the  Wehrmacht!”  Fellgiebel  had  been  executed  on  August  10;  Thiele  soon 
followed.  Lieutenant  General  Albert  Praun  took  Thiele’s  place  in  both  offices 
and  retained  them  to  the  end  of  the  war. 

The  oldest,  most  experienced,  and  closest  to  O.K.W.  of  the  other  crypt- 
analytic  agencies  was  the  Army’s  Heeresnachrichtenwesens  (“Army  Com- 
munications System”),  or  H.N.W.  The  Chef,  H.N.W.,  served  on  the  Army 
general  staff.  Like  the  U.S.  Army’s  Signal  Corps  during  World  War  II,  it  had 
both  communications  and  intercept-cryptanalysis  duties;  like  the  Signal 
Corps,  it  turned  over  its  solutions  to  Army  intelligence  for  evaluation  and 
use. 

Under  Chi’s  watchful  eye,  it  issued  cryptosystems  for  the  troops.  For  high- 
level  communications,  from  the  O.K.H.  down  to  regiments,  the  Army  used 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


459 


the  glowlamp  Enigma  cipher  machine.  It  was  reliable,  working  well  in  the 
Russian  winter  and  the  Libyan  summer.  Signal  officers  thought  it  crypt- 
analytically  secure  if— as  ordered  by  1942— keys  were  changed  three  times  a 
day.  Its  chief  disadvantage  was  that  it  did  not  print  its  output.  Battery- 
powered  and  portable,  it  could  be  operated  in  a moving  truck  and  was  well 
adapted  to  radio  work. 

Nevertheless,  in  1943  a new  machine  began  replacing  it  in  some  areas. 
This  was  a printing  machine,  produced  by  the  Wanderer  Werke  firm,  which 
copied  the  Hagelin  variable-gear  principle.  There  is  a story  that  one  of  these 
was  found  in  Norway  at  the  end  of  the  war  with  a message  still  in  it,  obviously 
abandoned  by  an  operator  who  disagreed  with  what  he  had  deciphered : Der 
Fuehrer  ist  tot.  Der  Kampf  geht  weiter.  Doenitz  (“The  Fiihrer  is  dead.  The 
war  goes  on.  Donitz”). 

For  wire  teletypewriter  communications  from  the  O.K.H.  to  army  corps 
and  a few  divisions,  the  Germans  used  an  on-line  machine  produced  by 
Siemens  & Halske  Aktiengesellschaft.  Its  heart  was  a set  of  ten  keywheels, 
similar  to  those  on  a Hagelin  machine,  rimmed  with  pins  that  could  be  made 
either  operative  or  inoperative.  Each  wheel  had  a prime  number  of  pins, 
ranging  from  47  on  the  smallest  to  89  on  the  largest.  Five  of  these  wheels 
enciphered  the  five  teletypewriter  pulses,  transforming  a mark  into  a space 
or  vice  versa  if  the  pin  then  in  position  was  operative,  or  leaving  the  pulse 
unchanged  if  it  was  inoperative.  The  other  five  wheels  effected  a transposition 
of  the  pulses.  The  machine  enciphered  and  transmitted  in  a single  operation, 
and  likewise  deciphered  and  printed  out  the  message  automatically. 

Beginning  in  June,  1942,  regiments,  battalions,  and  companies  enciphered 
with  the  double  transposition,  with  the  same  keyword  for  both  blocks  the 
same  system,  interestingly,  as  the  German  Army  used  at  the  start  of  World 
War  I.  (This  system  also  backed  up  the  Enigma.)  Each  division  produced  at 
least  three  keys  for  its  subordinate  units.  The  troops  heartily  disliked  the 
double  transposition,  however,  and  cleartext  messages  showed  a noticeable 
upsurge.  For  intelligence  and  combat  reports,  these  units  used  small  three- 
letter  or  three-digit  codes,  which  were  likewise  published  by  their  divisions. 
Many  cipherers  preferred  their  simplicity  to  the  complexity  of  the  double 
transposition,  and  often  used  them  for  orders  and  other  unauthorized 
messages.  A signal  officer  complained  bitterly  of  this  practice:  Tarntafeln 
sind  kein  Schliisselersatz!”  (“Code  tables  are  not  cipher  substitutes!  ),  he 
wrote  in  a report.  Later  in  the  war,  a bigraphic  substitution  replaced  the 
double  transposition  as  a front-line  cryptosystem,  and  in  1944  a modification 
of  the  grille  replaced  that.  In  addition,  the  signal  troops  used  numerous 
special  ciphers — for  call-signs,  numbers,  and  so  on. 

The  H.N.W.  communications-intelligence  service  operated  as  a separate 
organization  within  an  army  or  an  army  group,  though  parts  of  it  were  some- 
times specially  assigned.  In  1943,  for  example,  the  commander  of  Fernmel- 
deaufkliirung  7 (“Radio  Intelligence  7”),  reported  to  Field  Marshal  Albert 


460 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Kesselring.  Fernmeldeaufklarung  7 consisted  of  radio  intelligence  companies 
and  platoons  and  direction-finding  stations  widely  scattered  over  the  central 
Mediterranean  area — in  western  Crete,  southern  France,  northern  Africa, 
Sicily,  Sardinia,  and  Italy.  These  units  reported  their  intelligence  results  via 
their  own  radio  net  to  the  headquarters  at  Rocca  di  Papa,  south  of  Rome;  the 
original  intercepts  were  then  forwarded  to  headquarters  for  more  compre- 
hensive evaluation.  Fernmeldeaufklarung  7 distributed  radio  intelligence  of 
tactical  importance  to  the  lower  commands  by  broadcasting  it  in  a special 
cipher.  While  much  of  this  intelligence  came  from  conversations  or  radio 
messages  in  plaintext  or  from  traffic  analysis,  much  also  came  from 
cryptanalysis.  Similar  units  on  other  fronts  also  provided  valuable 
material. 

Thus  when  Hitler,  in  a fit  of  rage,  fell  upon  Yugoslavia,  his  armed  forces 
overran  that  tough  little  nation  across  mountainous  terrain  formerly  con- 
sidered blitzproof  with  a speed  that  could  not  be  fully  accounted  for  even 
by  their  overwhelming  strength.  And  in  fact  the  Germans  could  exploit  the 
Yugoslav  military  messages  to  tell  their  Panzer  commanders  where  and  how 
their  armored  columns  might  best  spear  down  toward  Zagreb,  Sarajevo,  and 
Belgrade.  For  since  January,  1940,  German  Army  intercept  personnel,  wearing 
civilian  clothes,  had  monitored  Yugoslav  emissions  from  an  intercept  station 
in  Sofia  and  had  broken  the  Yugoslav  military  cryptosystem. 

After  the  conquest,  a radio  intelligence  platoon  cryptanalyzed  the  ciphers 
of  the  partisans  under  General  Draja  Mikhailovich  and  his  Communist  rival, 
Tito.  The  results  enabled  the  occupation  troops  to  forestall  many  guerrilla 
depredations.  Tito,  finding  some  of  his  efforts  frustrated,  at  first  suspected 
treachery  and  purged  some  of  his  underlings.  Soon,  however,  he  guessed  the 
truth  and  changed  his  ciphers  with  great  frequency  but  with  no  success.  In 
the  spring  of  1943,  for  example,  the  Germans  picked  up  a series  of  messages 
from  which  it  became  clear  that  Tito’s  relations  with  his  Anglo-American 
allies  had  deteriorated.  Others  spoke  of  a proposed  Anglo-American  landing 
on  the  Adriatic  coast — but  this  never  came  off. 

German  Army  cryptanalysts  solved  American  m-209  messages  almost 
from  the  days  late  in  1942  when  the  two  armies  first  clashed  in  North  Africa. 
They  picked  up  such  tidbits  of  information  as  that  the  72nd,  45th,  and  29th 
Light  and  the  71st  Heavy  Anti-Aircraft  Regiments  were  placed  under  the 
52nd  Anti-Aircraft  Brigade,  which  is  part  of  the  order-of-battle  intelligence 
basic  to  a field  commander,  that  on  April  1,  1943,  the  3rd  Infantry  Regiment 
was  located  at  grid  square  43835,  or  37  kilometers  from  Gafa,  that  American 
forces  were  forbidden  to  fire  upon  airplanes  unless  the  airplanes  attacked 
them  (to  prevent  shooting  down  Allied  planes).  All  these  details  were  fitted 
together  to  give  the  German  command  a picture  of  the  troops  facing  them, 
their  state  of  mind,  their  preparation. 

Occasionally,  a single  solved  message  produced  strikingly  dramatic  results. 
During  a conference  at  the  headquarters  of  the  Commanding  General, 


461 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 

Southwest,  in  1943,  Colonel  Karl-Albert  Miigge,  commander  of  Fernmel- 
deaufklarung 7,  brought  Field  Marshal  Kesselring  a British  intercept  that 
had  just  been  cryptanalyzed.  It  reported  that  in  North  Africa  several  troop 
columns  were  caught  in  a traffic  jam  of  their  own  making  by  crowding  into  a 
wadi  at — and  here  the  cryptogram  was  garbled  so  that  the  exact  location 
could  not  be  read.  Kesselring  called  for  an  immediate  air  search;  the  jammed 
wadi  was  discovered  while  the  Germans  were  still  in  conference.  Kesselring 
promptly  ordered  an  air  attack,  which  wreaked  considerable  destruction  upon 
the  .concentrated  British  forces. 

Early  in  February,  1944,  during  the  Italian  campaign,  the  American  5th 
Army  attempted  to  recapture  the  Carrocetto  factory,  a pivotal  point  which 
the  Germans  had  taken  in  a counterattack.  “It  was  important  for  VI  Corps 
not  only  to  regain  the  Factory  area  but  also  to  effect  the  relief  of  at  least  a 
major  part  of  the  I Division,”  the  5th  Army  historian  wrote.  “Aided  by  the 
191st  Tank  Battalion,  men  of  the  1st  Battalion  made  their  way  into  the 
Factory  in  the  afternoon,  only  to  be  driven  out.  Though  our  artillery  and 
tanks  converted  the  buildings  into  a blazing  mass  of  ruins,  the  enemy  held ; 
prisoners  reported  that  an  intercepted  radio  message  had  given  them  fore- 
knowledge of  the  attack.  Another  attack  before  dawn  on  the  12th  likewise 
failed,  and  the  45th  Division  gave  up  the  effort  to  regain  the  Factory.” 

As  the  Allies  gained  air  superiority  and  the  Germans  could  no  longer 
reconnoiter  by  air,  they  depended  more  and  more  on  radio  intelligence.  This 
was  especially  true  after  the  Normandy  invasion.  But  this  means  was  not 
omniscient.  In  the  fall  of  1944,  when  General  George  Patton’s  army  was 
preparing  to  bite  out  the  fortress  of  Metz,  the  German  forces  detected  his 
preparations,  largely  through  radio.  “Yet,”  wrote  a German  staff  officer,  the 
actual  attack  on  8 November  came  as  a surprise  to  the  front  line  troops. 

In  the  field,  the  German  Army’s  communication  intelligence  unit  worked 
closely  with  the  Luftwaffe’s  Funkaufklarungsdienst  (“Radio  Reconnaissance 
Service”).  This  was  the  intelligence  side  of  the  Air  Force’s  Nachrichten- 
Verbindungswesen,  or  N.-V.W.  (“Intelligence  and  Signal  System  ),  whose 
chief  served  on  the  staff  of  the  O.K.L.  He  also  prescribed  secret  communica- 
tions systems  for  the  Luftwaffe.  Air-to-air  communications,  which  were 
mostly  by  voice,  employed  simple  codewords  to  disguise  unit  names,  much  as 
American  pilots  referred  to  one  another  as  easy  red  or  green  arrow  in  the 
style  made  familiar  by  war  movies.  Air-ground  communications  were 
encoded  in  small  three-digit  or  three-letter  codes.  Luftwaffe  ground-to-ground 
cryptography  used  the  Enigma. 

The  Funkaufklarungsdienst  employed  more  than  10,000  men.  Its  largest 
subdivision  was  Luftnachrichten  (“Air  Intelligence”)  Regiment  351,  with 
4,500  men,  which  intercepted,  solved,  and  evaluated  the  radio  traffic  of  Allied 
light  and  heavy  bombers,  fighters,  transports,  and  air  staffs  in  Western 
Europe.  An  additional  unit  of  1,000  provided  further  detailed  information  on 
the  heavy  bombers.  Smaller  regiments  covered  other  theaters.  Luftnach-

richten  Battalion  350,  with  800  men,  served  as  the  Luftwaffe  center  for  basic 
cryptanalysis  and  traffic  analysis,  as  well  as  for  the  study  of  new  enemy 
radars  and  radio  navigation  systems  to  find  the  best  means  of  jamming  or 
deceiving  them.  It  also  covered  the  Allied  transatlantic  air  transport  service. 
It  was  attached  to  the  main  headquarters  of  the  Funkaufklarungsdienst. 

Other  cryptanalysts  served  in  outlying  Funkaufklarungsdienst  units, 
solving  messages  in  systems  whose  basic  solution  had  been  worked  out  at 
headquarters.  They  had  reportedly  tried  to  use  women  in  teams  for  solving 
a widely  used  Allied  air-ground  system,  called  syko,  but  switched  to  male 
students  when  the  women  did  not  produce  satisfactory  results.  They  tested 
the  youths  by  crossword  puzzles  and  sent  the  10  per  cent  doing  the  best  to  a 
training  school  for  about  a month.  Here  they  were  trained  in  syko  crypt- 
analysis and  nothing  else.  As  an  incentive,  the  Nazis  told  the  trainees  that

Training  card  for  Allied  air-ground  cipher  syko 


464 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  lower  90  per  cent  of  the  class  would  be  shipped  off  to  the  Russian  front. 

Early  in  the  war,  syko  consisted  of  30  unrelated,  mixed  cipher  alphabets 
printed  on  a card.  The  alphabets  were  to  be  used  in  succession  to  encipher  a 
message,  the  encipherer  using  an  indicator  to  define  the  one  he  was  using  first. 
The  cards  were  changed  every  midnight.  Later,  syko  took  the  form  of  a 
hinged  frame  holding  a card  on  which  32  mixed  alphabets  of  letters  and 
numbers  were  printed  vertically.  The  frame  also  supported  32  sliding  strips, 
each  also  with  a mixed  alphabet,  each  of  which  uncovered  and  covered  one 
of  the  card  alphabets  as  it  moved  up  and  down.  The  encipherer  slid  the  strips 
to  align  the  plaintext  message  on  them  horizontally  at  the  foot  of  the  frame, 
and  read  the  ciphertext  from  the  letters  of  the  card  showing  immediately 
above  the  tops  of  the  strips.  The  alphabets  were  reciprocal,  so  that  decipher- 
ment followed  the  same  procedure.  It  produced  the  same  cipher  as  the  older 
version:  a periodic  polyalphabetic  with  mixed  alphabets,  whose  period, 
moreover,  was  known — rather  like  the  Fur  god  of  World  War  I.  An  e in  the 
first  column  was  always  represented  by  the  same  ciphertext  letter  while  that 
card  remained  in  use,  which  was  for  24  hours.  The  Allies  apparently  used 
syko  because  it  was  light,  fast,  and  simple,  but  its  insecurity  meant  that  on 
days  of  heavy  traffic  the  Axis  syko  teams  were  reading  Allied  air  messages  by 
10  or  11  a.m. 

It  was  probably  not  syko  that  enciphered  the  message  that  gave  the  Funk- 
aufklarungsdienst  one  of  its  greatest  triumphs,  since  the  message  originated  in 
a high-echelon  ground  command  and  was  directed  to  other  ground  com- 
mands, while  the  planes  themselves  maintained  radio  silence.  These  were  178 
four-engined  Liberators,  heading  for  the  Rumanian  oil  fields  at  Ploesti, 
Hitler’s  chief  source  of  oil  for  his  thirsty  war  machine,  in  one  of  the  longest- 
range  and  potentially  one  of  the  most  important  air  strikes  of  the  war.  As 
they  lumbered  into  the  air  at  Bengazi  on  the  morning  of  August  1,  1943,  for 
their  1,200-mile  flight,  the  9th  Air  Force  spread  a short  message  to  Allied 
forces  in  the  Mediterranean  area  announcing  that  a large  mission  was  air- 
borne from  Libya.  This  was  necessary  because  only  a few  weeks  before,  in  the 
invasion  of  Sicily,  the  U.S.  Navy  had  shot  down  dozens  of  American  troop 
planes  in  the  tragically  mistaken  belief  that  they  were  German  bombers. 

The  message  was  picked  up  by  a Funkaufklarungsdienst  unit  recently 
posted  near  Athens.  Soon  its  cryptanalysts  had  reduced  it  to  plaintext. 
Lieutenant  Christian  Ochsenschlager  then  passed  to  all  defense  commands 
“interested  or  affected”  a message  stating  that  a large  formation  of  four- 
engined  bombers,  believed  to  be  Liberators,  had  been  taking  off  since  early 
morning  in  the  Bengazi  area.  This  gave  the  antiaircraft  defenses  at  Ploesti,  the 
heaviest  in  Europe,  plenty  of  time  to  get  ready.  When  the  bombers  roared  at 
derrick-top  height  over  the  Rumanian  oil  field,  with  its  wells,  refineries,  and 
tanks,  they  were  met  with  the  worst  flak  encountered  by  American  bombers 
during  the  war.  Of  the  178,  53,  or  almost  every  third  plane,  were  downed, 
and  dozens  of  Americans  died. 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


465 


The  German  cryptanalytic  agency  that  probably  had  the  greatest  effect 
upon  the  course  of  the  war  was  also  the  smallest  and  least  known.  It  belonged 
to  the  O.K.M.,  and  Grand  Admiral  Karl  Donitz,  commander  of  the  German 
Navy  during  the  latter  half  of  the  war,  called  it  his  “B-Dienst,”  for  “Beobach- 
tung-Dienst”  (“Observation  Service”).  The  B-Dienst  had  little  contact  with 
the  other  codebreaking  agencies.  Yet  its  successes  were  more  far-reaching 
than  any  of  theirs,  and  it  participated  in  some  of  the  most  unusual  activities  of 
the  cryptanalytic  war. 

Stung  in  the  1920s  by  revelations  of  Room  40’s  readings  of  German  naval 
traffic,  the  O.K.M.  built  up  so  effective  a cryptanalytic  unit  that  by  the  start 
of  World  War  II  the  B-Dienst  had  solved  some  of  the  most  secret  Admiralty 
codes  and  ciphers.  The  penetration  of  British  naval  messages  enabled  German 
surface  raiders  to  elude  the  British  Home  Fleet,  spared  German  heavy  ships 
from  many  a chance  encounter  with  stronger  British  forces,  permitted  surprise 
attacks  on  British  warships,  and  helped  sink  six  British  submarines  in  the 
Skagerrak  area  between  June  and  August  of  1940. 

Perhaps  its  greatest  feat  came  in  the  Norway  invasion.  On  March  1, 
Hitler  approved  the  plan  to  invade  Norway,  but  set  no  date  for  it.  Soon  there- 
after, the  B-Dienst  solved  British  naval  messages  that  revealed  a British  plan 
to  mine  the  entrance  to  Narvik,  far  in  the  north  of  Norway,  and  to  occupy  that 
port;  Britain  intended  to  block  German  ore  shipments.  This  information 
enabled  the  German  Hgh  command  to  shape  a strategy  for  surmounting  the 
greatest  difficulty  in  its  Norway  invasion:  how  to  move  its  weakly  guarded 
transports  from  Germany  to  Norway  without  interference  by  the  powerful 
British  fleet.  When  the  British  Narvik  expedition  was  under  way,  the  high 
command  plotted,  Germany  would  send  out  a decoy  force  which  the  British 
would  think  was  heading  to  attack  their  expedition  at  Narvik.  To  protect  it, 
Britain  would  send  the  rest  of  its  naval  forces  away  to  the  north.  As  soon  as 
this  happened,  the  transports  would  cross  the  Skagerrak  without  fear  of 
major  sea  attack. 

The  scheme  worked  to  perfection.  Late  in  March  the  B-Dienst  showed 
British  vessels  en  route  to  Narvik.  On  April  2 Hitler  set  the  invasion  for  the 
9th.  The  decoy  force  put  out  to  sea  and  was  spotted  on  the  7th  by  the  British. 
As  the  Germans  expected,  the  Admiralty  ordered  the  Home  Fleet  and  the 
1st  and  2nd  Cruiser  Squadrons  to  head  for  Narvik.  As  they  raced  away 
from  where  the  action  was,  the  German  transports  completed  their  voyage 
undisturbed  by  the  nation  that  supposedly  rules  the  waves  and  landed  their 
occupation  troops  without  a hitch.  Even  Winston  Churchill  admitted  that 
Germany  had  “completely  outwitted”  Britannia. 

The  B-Dienst  may  have  gained  a great  deal  of  help  from  some  spectacular 
coups  by  the  German  merchant  raider  Atlantis.  This  specially  fitted  high- 
speed freighter,  whose  heavy  armament  was  carefully  camouflaged,  was  one 
of  several  that  cruised  the  oceans  and  harassed  Allied  shipping.  On  July  10, 
1940,  in  one  of  her  first  actions,  Atlantis  fired  a few  shots  into  City  of  Baghdad 


466 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


in  the  Indian  Ocean  and  captured  the  vessel  almost  intact  when  her  crew 
hastily  abandoned  ship.  A boarding  party  reached  the  officers’  cabins  just  in 
time  to  point  a pistol  at  the  captain  and  stop  him  from  throwing  overboard 
most  of  the  ship's  secret  papers.  Among  them  was  the  Allied  Merchant 
Ships'  Code,  a two-part  code  issued  by  the  Admiralty  for  messages  via  the 
Broadcasting  for  Allied  Merchant  Ships,  or  BAMS,  commonly  called  the 
“BAMS  code.” 

Also  recovered  were  several  superencipherment  tables,  though  not  the 
current  ones.  Atlantis,  however,  had  aboard  in  her  special  crew  a wireless 
operator  named  Wesemann  who  had  served  for  three  years  in  one  of  the 
German  cryptanalytic  services.  Wesemann  achieved  what  might  be  the  first 
nautical  cryptanalysis  on  record  when,  on  the  basis  of  the  captured  code  and 
several  merchant  messages  that  he  had  intercepted,  he  succeeded  in  recon- 
structing about  one  third  of  the  superencipherment  table  then  in  use.  As  a 
result,  Atlantis  could  read  much  of  the  Allied  merchantmen’s  traffic  and 
could  await  her  victims  at  likely  spots. 

When  the  tables  were  changed,  Wesemann  partially  reconstructed  the  new 
ones  with  the  help  of  some  messages  found  in  the  wastebasket  of  the  radio 
shack  of  another  captured  vessel,  Benarty.  The  work  was  completed  for  him 
by  the  B-Dienst,  which  deduced  from  his  radio  queries  that  he  had  obtained 
the  BAMS  code  and  consequently  sent  him  the  interpretations  he  needed. 
Since  Atlantis  and  Berlin  were  then  almost  at  antipodes  from  one  another, 
this  must  rank  as  the  longest-distance  cryptanalytic  collaboration  known.  A 
few  months  later,  on  November  11,  1940,  the  crew  of  the  German  raider 
found  aboard  Automedon,  the  13th  ship  she  had  sunk,  another  copy  of  the 
BAMS  code  and  superencipherment  tables  7,  8,  and  9.  All  the  cryptanalyzed 
information  contributed  to  Atlantis'  record  as  the  war’s  deadliest  sea  raider. 

She  may  have  sent  the  B-Dienst  photographs  of  the  captured  codebooks 
when  one  of  her  prize  ships  returned  to  Germany,  or  the  B-Dienst  may  have 
obtained  a copy  elsewhere.  Either  way,  the  German  knowledge  of  merchant 
messages  vastly  improved  U-boat  attacks.  And,  wrote  Churchill,  “The  Battle 
of  the  Atlantic  was  the  dominating  factor  all  through  the  war.  Never  for  one 
moment  could  we  forget  that  everything  happening  elsewhere,  on  land,  at  sea, 
or  in  the  air,  depended  ultimately  upon  its  outcome.”  More  than  once,  the 
B-Dienst  placed  in  the  hands  of  the  U-boat  commanders  the  knowledge  that 
brought  them  to  the  edge  of  victory. 

In  1941,  for  example,  the  B-Dienst  read  messages  to  convoys  from  the 
-Commander  in  Chief,  Western  Approaches,  that  directed  those  convoys  from 
the  danger  zones  just  west  of  the  British  Isles.  With  this  intelligence,  the  U- 
boat  command  had  no  difficulty  in  deploying  its  submarines  to  the  maximum 
effectiveness.  Allied  losses  mounted  steeply.  In  March,  April,  and  May,  U- 
boats  sank  142  vessels,  or  more  than  one  every  16  hours.  In  January  and 
February  of  1943,  the  B-Dienst  mastered  British  naval  cryptosystems  so  fully 
that  it  was  even  reading  the  British  “U-Boat  Situation  Report,”  which  was

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

regularly  broadcast  to  the  commanders  of  convoys  at  sea,  telling  them  the 
known  and  presumed  locations  of  U-boats!  “These  'Situation  Reports'  were 
of  the  greatest  value  to  us  in  our  efforts  to  determine  how  the  enemy  was  able 
to  find  out  about  our  U-boat  dispositions  and  with  what  degree  of  accuracy 
he  did  so,”  wrote  Admiral  Donitz. 

The  following  month,  March  of  1943,  saw  the  climax  of  the  Battle  of  the 
Atlantic.  And  the  climactic  action,  the  greatest  triumph  of  the  U-boats,  in 
which  they  very  nearly  severed  Britain’s  lifeline,  stemmed  directly  from  a 
series  of  B-Dienst  solutions. 

The  first  came  on  March  9.  A B-Dienst  report  gave  the  precise  location  of 
the  eastbound  convoy  hx  228.  (The  hx  stood  for  Halifax,  Nova  Scotia, 
assembly  point  for  all  fast  convoys.  Slow  convoys,  which  started  at  Sydney, 
Cape  Breton  Island,  Nova  Scotia,  were  designated  sc.)  Shortly  thereafter,  the 
B-Dienst  reported  that  the  next  fast  convoy,  hx  229,  was  southeast  of  Cape 
Race,  steaming  on  a course  of  89  degrees.  On  the  14th,  another  solution 
revealed  that  a third  convoy,  sc  122,  had  received  orders  at  noon  the  day 
before  that  on  reaching  a given  point  it  was  to  steer  67  degrees.  The  U-boats, 
then  operating  in  wolf  packs  of  two  or  three  dozen,  were  ordered  to  search 
for  the  convoys.  On  the  morning  of  March  16,  they  sighted  a convoy 
which  turned  out  to  be  hx  229,  and  in  the  next  two  days,  38  U-boats  sent  13 
ships  to  the  bottom.  Meanwhile,  hx  229  overtook  the  slow-moving  sc  122, 
forming  a large  mass  of  shipping  in  a small  space  of  ocean.  The  wolf  pack 
nipped  at  its  edges  and  sank  eight  more  vessels,  making  a total  of  141,000  tons 
sunk  in  the  three-day  battle,  at  a cost  of  only  a single  U-boat.  Donitz 
exulted : “It  was  the  greatest  success  that  we  had  so  far  scored  against  a 
convoy.” 

The  Admiralty  despaired.  They  considered  abandoning  the  convoy 
system  as  ineffective,  which  was  tantamount  to  an  admission  of  defeat, 
since  no  alternative  existed,  the  loss  rate  of  single  vessels  being  double 
that  of  ships  in  convoy.  “The  Germans  never  came  so  near  to  disrupting 
communications  between  the  New  World  and  the  Old  as  in  the  first 
twenty  days  of  March,  1943,”  the  naval  staff  later  recorded.  It  marked 
the  darkest  hour  of  the  longest,  most  crucial  battle  of  the  war.  And 
in  large  measure  German  cryptanalysts  had  cast  this  pall  upon  Britain 
by — paradoxically — throwing  light  upon  British  communications. 

Italy  relied  for  her  communication  intelligence  upon  her  Army  and  her 
Navy.  The  Navy’s  cryptanalysts  formed  the  b section  of  the  Servizio  Infor- 
mazione  Segreto,  or  naval  intelligence.  Early  in  1942,  they  had  penetrated  the 
British  naval  ciphers  in  the  Mediterranean — these  were  so  poor  that  Admiral 
Sir  Andrew  Cunningham  reportedly  threatened  after  the  invasion  of  Crete  to 
transmit  entirely  in  clear  if  he  were  not  given  better  ciphers.  The  Italian 
solution  of  a British  scout  plane  report  enabled  the  Italian  high  command  to 
warn  one  of  its  task-force  commanders  at  6 p.m.  March  27,  just  before  the

Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


469 


Battle  of  Cape  Matapan,  that  the  English  had  sighted  him  soon  after  he  had 
put  to  sea.  Next  day  the  reading  of  an  order  to  Cunningham  from  Alexandria 
made  the  Italians  certain  that  British  torpedo  planes  would  attack.  They  did, 
and  so  prepared  were  the  Italians  that  the  intensity  of  their  antiaircraft 
defense  made  it  almost  impossible  for  the  English  to  identify  their  targets  or 
observe  the  results  of  the  attack. 

The  Italian  Army’s  security  and  intelligence  organization,  the  Servizio 
Informazione  Militare,  or  S.I.M.,  had  a large  and  well-organized  cryptologic 
section  which  solved  diplomatic  as  well  as  military  cryptograms.  This  was  its 
Sezione  5,  headed  by  General  Vittorio  Gamba,  an  old  Alpine  warrior  with 
austere  features.  A long-time  student  of  cryptology  and  author  of  an  excellent 
article  on  the  subject  in  the  Encielopedia  Italiana,  Gamba  was  a noted  linguist 
who  reputedly  knew  25  languages.  He  came  to  public  attention  in  1911  when 
he  translated  a series  of  proclamations  into  Arabic  during  the  Italo-Turkish 
conflict  over  Tripoli.  The  50  members  of  Sezione  5 were  housed  in  a large 
apartment  house  in  Rome  far  from  S.I.M.  headquarters  but  connected  by 
teletypewriter  with  it  and  with  the  extensive  intercept  unit,  Sezione  6,  located 
on  the  Forte  Bocea,  a hill  behind  the  Vatican.  Gamba’s  cryptanalysts  main- 
tained close  liaison  with  the  chemical  section,  which  worked  with  secret  inks 
and  other  means  of  steganography,  with  the  censorship  section,  and  with  the 
phototypographic  section,  which  rapidly  reproduced  stolen  documents. 

Also  under  Gamba  was  a subsection  headed  by  the  elderly  Colonel  Gino 
Mancini  that  produced  codes  and  ciphers  for  the  Italian  Army.  At  the  higher 
levels,  these  were  enciphered  codes,  also  used  by  the  Italian  Navy  (which  at 
other  times  used  the  Hagelin  machine).  The  Italians  liked  superencipher- 
ments that  combined  transposition  with  substitution — a preference  that  can 
be  seen  as  far  back  as  the  Panizzardi  telegram  of  Dreyfus  case  fame,  in  which 
the  first  placode  digit  became  the  second  encicode  digit  and  vice  versa.  In  one 
of  their  World  War  II  encipherments,  for  example,  with  placode  groups 
12345  67890,  the  encipherer  would  pick  out  1 and  6,  find  the  encicode  for  16 
in  a 10  x 10  table,  and,  assuming  it  to  be  38,  would  set  down  3 as  the  first  digit 
of  the  first  encicode  group  and  8 as  the  first  digit  of  the  second.  He  would 
repeat  this  with  2 and  7,  using,  however,  a different  10  x 10  table.  At  first  the 
Italians  used  five  such  tables;  later,  they  used  ten. 

Like  their  O.K.W.  colleagues,  the  Sezione  5 cryptanalysts  had  solved  the 
military  ciphers  of  Yugoslavia,  with  whom  Italy’s  relations  had  been  strained 
over  Fiume  and  Trieste  practically  since  Yugoslavia  was  created  after  World 
War  I.  The  Germans  used  the  solutions  for  a blitzkrieg  from  the  north.  The 
Italians  exploited  them  in  a crafty  deception  that  helped  avoid  a possible 
debacle  in  the  south. 

Almost  up  to  the  moment  of  the  Axis  invasion,  the  Italian  armies  that  had 
occupied  Albania  had  exposed  what  Churchill  picturesquely  called  their 
“naked  rear”  to  Yugoslavia  in  the  north.  Yugoslavia  had  no  chance  against 
the  Wehrmacht,  but  both  Axis  and  Allies  realized  that  if  she  struck  forcefully 


470 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


against  the  rather  disorganized  Italians,  she  could  win  a major  victory, 
embarrass  Mussolini,  delay  the  Axis  conquest,  and  acquire  the  munitions 
and  supplies  for  a large-scale  guerrilla  harassment  of  the  Nazi  occupiers. 
Thus,  when  two  Yugoslav  divisions  drove  southward  on  April  7 — one  from 
Cetinje  toward  Shkoder,  the  other  from  Kosowska  Mitrovica  toward 
Kukes — it  was  regarded  as  a serious  business.  Especially  when,  by  April  12, 
the  Cetinje  division  had  shoved  the  Italians  back  to  the  gates  of  Shkoder  and 
was  pummeling  them  with  attacks  of  increasing  intensity. 

At  this  juncture  the  Servizio  Informazione  Militare  got  an  idea.  It  drafted 
two  telegrams  in  Yugoslav  military  style  and  affixed  the  signature  of  General 
Dusan  Simovic,  head  of  the  new  government.  One  read  : 

To  the  Cetinje  divisional  headquarters: 

Subordinate  troops  will  suspend  all  offensive  action  and  retire  in  the  direc- 
tion of  Podgorica,  organizing  for  defense. 

And  the  other: 

To  the  Kosowska  Mitrovica  divisional  headquarters: 

Withdraw  immediately  with  all  subordinate  troops  back  towards  Kosowska 

Mitrovica. 

Simovic 

Both  messages  were  enciphered  in  the  Yugoslav  Army  system,  and  at  10 
a.m.  on  April  13,  an  S.I.M.  station,  observing  all  Yugoslav  radio  regulations 
as  to  wavelength,  transmission  times,  and  subordinate  stations,  contacted  the 
two  divisional  stations  and  passed  the  messages,  both  of  which  were  receipted 
for.  The  drive  toward  Kukes  slackened  immediately.  The  Cetinje  division, 
however,  requested  confirmation.  None  came. 

Next  morning,  the  confused  divisional  command,  not  having  received 
any  disavowal  of  the  enciphered  orders,  and  consequently  believing  that  they 
were  valid  though  incomprehensible,  lifted  its  attacks  at  Shkoder  and  began 
retreating  northward.  The  Italians  hastened  to  fill  the  military  vacuum  that 
was  created,  and  marched  the  10  miles  from  Kotor  to  Cetinje  in  a day.  Next 
day  the  Yugoslav  headquarters  replied  that  no  retreat  had  been  ordered,  but 
by  then  it  was  too  late.  It  only  told  the  Yugoslavs  that  their  ciphers  were 
compromised,  and,  unable  to  issue  new  ones  in  the  fluid  situation,  they 
attempted  to  assure  the  legitimacy  of  their  communications  through  onerous 
controls.  Instead  they  gummed  their  command  machinery  at  a time  when 
every  hour  counted.  A few  days  later  it  was  all  over.  The  S.I.M.’s  fake 
messages  had  saved  Italy  from  a crippling  defeat. 

In  a typical  month  during  the  war  the  S.I.M.’s  Sezione  6 intercepted 
8,000  radiograms.  About  6,000  were  considered  worthy  of  study,  and  of  these, 
Sezione  5 reduced  3,500  to  plaintext.  So  great  was  the  flow  that  General 
Cesare  Arne,  head  of  the  S.I.M.,  began  to  publish  a daily  Bulletin  I,  which 
summarized  the  most  significant  information.  Its  three  copies  went  to 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis 


471 


Mussolini,  to  the  chief  of  the  general  staff,  and  to  the  king,  through  his  aide- 
de-camp.  The  S.I.M.  distributed  other  important  solutions  individually  to 
the  proper  parties. 

Diplomatic  traffic  naturally  went  to  Count  Galeazzo  Ciano,  the  Foreign 
Minister,  whose  many  mentions  of  the  solutions  in  his  famous  diary  testify  to 
their  importance.  According  to  the  diary,  Sezione  5 read  British,  Rumanian, 
and  Turkish  traffic.  The  Italians  drank  as  deeply  of  the  stream  of  that  neutral’s 
messages  as  the  Hungarian  group  that  worked  for  Hottl  was  to  do.  For  more 
than  two  years,  Turkish  cryptograms  told  the  Italian  government  of  rumored 
Allied  war  plans,  of  Allied  views,  of  an  uncommitted  observer’s  comments  on 
Axis  programs  and  prospects.  On  January  4,  1943,  Ciano  jotted  in  his  diary: 
“The  Duce  asked  me  to  give  [Hans  Georg]  von  Mackensen  [German  ambas- 
sador to  Italy]  a copy  of  a telegram  the  Turkish  ambassador  Zorlu  sent  to  his 
government  from  Kuibyshev.  It  is  a description  of  the  Soviet  situation.  It 
seems  impartial  and  quite  informative.  According  to  him,  the  war  weighs 
heavily  on  the  Russians,  but  Russia  is  still  strong,  and,  in  the  judgment  of  the 
diplomatic  corps  in  Kuibyshev,  Axis  stock  is  falling.” 

One  entry  may  indicate  the  Italian  solution  of  an  English  solution  of  a 
German  telegram:  “Then,  too,  he  [Mussolini]  is  angry  at  Rommel,  who, 
according  to  English  sources,  has  telegraphed  accusing  several  of  our  officers 
of  having  revealed  some  of  his  future  plans  to  the  enemy.  As  always,  victory 
finds  a hundred  fathers,  but  defeat  is  an  orphan.”  Two  and  a half  months 
later,  on  December  24,  1942,  another  British  intercept  enabled  Mussolini  to 
ready  a reply  to  a planned  British  move:  “We  are  at  loggerheads  again  on  the 
question  of  the  bombing  of  Rome.  From  an  intercepted  British  telegram  we 
learn  that  in  addition  to  the  departure  of  the  Duce  and  the  commands  from 
Rome,  [British  Foreign  Minister  Anthony]  Eden  also  wants  that  of  the  King 
and  of  the  whole  government,  with  Swiss  officers  controlling  the  evacuation. 
Naturally  Mussolini  reacted  vigorously  and  is  preparing  to  refuse.”  Six  days 
later,  Ciano  noted:  “A  good  point  on  the  question  of  the  bombing  of  Rome: 
from  an  intercepted  telegram  we  learn  that  the  Americans  have  said  no  to 
Eden’s  Draconian  request,  declaring  that  they  do  not  intend  to  bomb  the 
city  of  St.  Peter  because  there  would  be  more  disadvantages  than  advantages 
for  the  Allies.  Thus  it  seems  to  me  that  the  matter  can  be  tabled.  At  least  for 
the  time  being.”  And  the  following  month  Mussolini  ordered  Ciano  to  give 
von  Mackensen  yet  another  British  intercept.  This  one  reported  a conversation 
between  General  Bernard  Montgomery  and  the  captured  German  commander 
in  Africa,  General  Ritter  Wilhelm  von  Thoma,  in  which  “von  Thoma  said 
that  the  Germans  are  convinced  that  they  have  lost  the  war,  and  that  the 
Army  is  anti-Nazi  because  it  holds  Hitler  completely  responsible.” 

These  were  only  the  telegrams  that  Ciano  thought  outstanding  enough  to 
note.  How  many  more  must  have  fluttered  onto  Fascist  desks  without  his 
mentioning  them,  and  how  much  knowledge  of  Allied  plans  must  Italy  have 
obtained  from  the  continuous  flow!

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Though  Sezione  5 solved  many  cryptograms,  many  of  its  successes  came, 
not  from  cryptanalysis,  but  from  the  S.I.M.’s  theft  of  cryptologic  documents. 
In  1941  alone,  the  S.I.M.  obtained  possession  of  about  50  such  items,  or 
about  one  a week.  Some  of  these  probably  were  only  plaintext  versions  of 
coded  telegrams.  But  many  were  the  codes  or  ciphers  themselves,  and  one  of 
them,  which  led  to  probably  the  greatest  Axis  communications-intelligence 
results  of  the  war,  was  a secret  code  of  the  United  States  of  America. 

The  spy  who  stole  it  appears  to  have  been  Loris  Gherardi,  a messenger  in 
the  office  of  the  American  military  attache  in  Rome.  An  Italian  national  just 
turned  40,  he  had  worked  for  the  Americans  since  about  1920.  His  duties 
included  the  carrying  of  telegrams  from  the  attache’s  office  to  the  Italian 
telegraph  bureau.  In  August  of  1941  he  apparently  obtained  for  the  S.I.M. 
the  key  or  an  impression  of  the  key  or  the  combination  to  an  embassy  safe. 
This  enabled  the  Italians  surreptitiously  to  open  the  safe,  remove  and  photo- 
graph the  black  code  and  its  attendant  superencipherment  tables,  and  then 
replace  them.  Neither  his  boss,  the  military  attache,  Colonel  Norman  E. 
Fiske,  nor  the  ambassador  ever  suspected  a thing.  Loris  continued  on  the 
job.* 

The  black  code,  so  called  for  the  color  of  its  binding,  was  a relatively 
new  and  secret  military  attache  code,  with  its  own  superencipherment  tables. 
Ambassadors  may  also  have  used  it.  Thus  Ciano  gloated  in  his  diary  on 
September  30,  1941,  shortly  after  the  theft:  “The  military  intelligence  service 
has  come  into  possession  of  the  American  secret  code;  everything  that  [U.S. 
Ambassador  William]  Phillips  telegraphs  is  read  by  our  decoding  offices. . . .” 

Soon  after  the  S.I.M.  acquired  the  code,  it  gave  a copy  to  Germany’s 
Canaris.  From  that  moment,  the  Axis  powers — subject  only  to  their  ability  to 
strip  the  superencipherments — were  enabled  to  peer  into  the  secret  messages 
of  the  diplomats  and  the  military  attaches  of  a great  power  that  their 
enemies  were  seeking  desperately  to  win  over.  And  the  messages  came  from 
all  over  the  world,  not  only  from  Axis  capitals,  but  also  from  Allied  capitals 
where  the  American  attaches  had  access  to  some  of  the  most  intimate  secrets 
of  the  Axis’  foes.  “I  handed  Mackensen,”  Ciano  noted  on  February  12,  1942, 
“the  text  of  a telegram  from  the  American  military  attache  at  Moscow, 
addressed  to  Washington.  It  complains  about  failure  to  deliver  arms  promised 
by  the  United  States,  and  says  that  if  the  U.S.S.R.  is  not  aided  immediately 
and  properly  she  will  have  to  consider  capitulating.” 

But  the  most  valuable  material  dealt  with  the  battlefronts,  where  the 
issue  of  victory  or  defeat  was  being  decided.  In  the  fall  of  1941,  the  Germans 
were  driving  eastward  on  two  fronts,  Russia  and  North  Africa,  intending  to 
link  them  up  in  the  Near  East,  make  the  Mediterranean  an  Axis  lake,  march

embassy.  After  the  war,  he  coolly  asked  for  his  old  job  back — and  got  it  1 He  held  it  until  the 
secret  finally  leaked  out;  then,  after  several  interrogations,  he  resigned,  in  August.  1949.

on  to  India,  and  meet  the  Japanese  in  Asia,  thereby  ruling  the  world  and 
fulfilling  Hitler’s  dream  of  out-conquering  Alexander  the  Great. 

The  American  military  attache  in  Cairo  had  much  better  opportunities  to 
observe  military  action  than  his  colleague  in  Moscow,  owing  to  factors  of 
distance,  language,  and  politics,  and  he  took  full  advantage  of  these  oppor- 
tunities to  do  his  job.  He  was  Colonel  Bonner  Frank  Fellers,  a West  Pointer 
with  a varied  peacetime  experience,  including  two  years  as  assistant  to 
General  Douglas  MacArthur.  Fellers  had  been  posted  to  Cairo  in  October, 
1940.  He  industriously  toured  the  battlefronts  and  studied  the  tactics  and 
problems  of  desert  warfare.  He  asked  questions.  He  kept  his  eyes  open.  The 
British  let  him  in  on  some  of  their  secrets,  hoping  that  this  would  improve 
American  equipment  lend-leased  to  Britain’s  desert  forces,  but  probably 
withheld  some  because  of  his  anti-British  predilections.  Fellers  soaked  up  this 
great  quantity  of  information  and  poured  it  out  to  Washington  in  voluminous 
and  detailed  reports. 

He  discussed  the  British  forces  at  the  front,  their  duties,  capabilities,  and 
effectiveness;  he  told  of  reinforcements  that  were  expected  and  supply  ships 
that  had  arrived,  explained  morale  problems,  analyzed  the  various  tactics 
that  the  British  had  under  consideration,  even  reported  on  plans  for  local 
military  operations.  He  carefully  encoded  his  messages  in  the  black  code  and 
radioed  them  to  Washington,  usually  addressed  to  milid  wash  (Military 
/ntelligence  Division,  Washington).  And  as  his  transmissions  flashed  through 
the  ether,  listening  Axis  radio  stations — usually  at  least  two,  so  that  nothing 
would  be  missed — took  down  every  word.  The  intercepts  were  transmitted  by 
direct  wire  to  cryptanalysts, where  they  were  reduced  to  plaintext,  translated, 
reenciphered  in  a German  system,  and  forwarded  to  General  Erwin  Rommel, 
commander  of  the  Afrika  Korps.  He  often  had  the  messages  only  a few  hours 
after  Fellers  had  sent  them. 

And  what  messages  they  were!  They  provided  Rommel  with  undoubtedly 
the  broadest  and  clearest  picture  of  enemy  forces  and  intentions  available 
to  any  Axis  commander  throughout  the  whole  war.  In  the  seesaw  North 
African  warfare,  Rommel  had  been  driven  back  across  the  desert  by  the 
British  under  General  Claude  Auchinleck  at  the  end  of  1941,  but  beginning 
on  January  21,  1942,  he  rebounded  with  such  vigor  that  in  seventeen  days  he 
had  thrown  the  British  back  300  miles.  During  those  days  he  was  getting 
information  like  this  from  the  Fellers  intercepts: 

January  23:  270  airplanes  and  a quantity  of  antiaircraft  artillery  being 
withdrawn  from  North  Africa  to  reinforce  British  forces  in  the  Far  East. 

January  25-26:  Allied  evaluation  of  the  defects  of  Axis  armor  and  aircraft. 

January  29:  Complete  rundown  of  British  armor,  including  number  in 
working  order,  number  damaged,  number  available,  and  their  locations; 
location  and  efficiency  ratings  of  armored  and  motorized  units  at  the  front.

grouped.

These  only  highlight  the  outstanding  tesserae  of  the  abundantly  detailed 
mosaic  which  Rommel  had  available  and  which  helped  him  win  his  epithet, 
“the  Desert  Fox.”  And  when  in  May  of  1942  his  Panzer  divisions  rolled 
forward  in  his  supreme  effort  to  conquer  Egypt  and  punch  through  Palestine 
to  join  the  Wehrmacht  forces  from  Russia,  the  intercepted  American  messages 
again  brought  him  information  of  the  highest  importance.  They  first  told  him 
that  the  British  were  planning  to  anchor  their  defense  line  on  Mersa  Matruh, 
a town  on  the  Mediterranean  coast  about  200  miles  west  of  Alexandria; 
then,  when  Auchinleck  decided  that  this  position  was  untenable,  the  intercepts 
kept  Rommel  up  to  date  with  the  British  changes  of  mind. 

But  even  Rommel  could  not  do  much  without  gasoline  for  his  tanks  and 
troop-carriers,  and  of  this  he  never  had  enough.  The  thorn  in  his  side  was 
Malta.  This  tough  little  island,  a British  bastion  lying  in  the  Mediterranean 
between  Sicily  and  the  Axis  bases  in  North  Africa,  served  as  the  base  from 
which  Allied  ships,  planes,  and  submarines  wreaked  havoc  on  Axis  convoys 
carrying  men  and  supplies  to  Rommel.  Thus  Germany  and  Italy  sought  to 
batter  it  into  submission  with  air  raids  night  and  day,  while  England  sought 
to  strengthen  and  arm  it  by  driving  convoys  through  to  her  port  of  Valletta. 
When  the  Axis  supply  line  was  flowing  freely,  Rommel  scored  one  victory 
after  another;  when  the  Allies  choked  off  his  supply  line  and  his  tanks  thirsted 
for  petrol,  Rommel's  mobility  in  this  highly  fluid  war  of  movement  was 
seriously  restricted,  giving  the  Allies  a considerable  advantage. 

Hence  in  June  of  1942  the  British  determined  to  make  a large-scale  attempt 
to  relieve  Malta.  They  planned  to  pass  convoys  through  from  the  east  and 
from  the  west  simultaneously,  thus  preventing  the  Axis  from  concentrating 
all  its  might  on  either  movement.  To  paralyze  Italian  surface  forces,  Britain 
heavily  bombed  the  Taranto  naval  base,  and  to  minimize  Axis  air  attacks  on 
the  convoys,  the  British  planned  to  destroy  Axis  airplanes  just  before  the 
convoys  sailed.  This  they  would  accomplish  by  bombing,  by  swift  strikes  of 
motorized  forces  on  airfields  near  the  front,  and  by  sabotage  from  com- 
mandos parachuted  onto  other  airfields  deeper  within  the  German  lines. 
Fellers,  who  was  in  close  touch  with  the  situation,  knew  of  these  plans,  and 
on  June  1 1 — the  day  the  eastern  half  of  the  convoy  sailed  from  Alexandria — 
he  drafted  message  No.  11119:

Nights  of  June  12th  June  13th  British  sabotage  units  plan  simultaneous

This  method  of  attack  offers  tremendous  possibility  for  destruction,  risk  is

pared to  make  immediate  use  all  R.A.F.  [Royal  Air  Force]  to  support  co- 
ordinating attacks  by  army.

He  encoded  it  and  filed  it  with  the  Egyptian  Telegraph  Company  in 
Cairo  for  radio  transmission  to  milid  wash.  The  O.K.W.  intercept  station  at 
Lauf  snatched  it  from  the  ether  at  about  8 a.m.  June  12.  By  9 a cryptanalyst 
was  working  on  it  to  strip  the  superencipherment ; by  10  it  had  been  decrypted ; 
by  11:30  Rommel  had  it  in  plenty  of  time  to  warn  his  airfields.  On  the  night 
of  the  13th,  as  expected,  commandos  dropped  from  the  sky  and  strike  forces 
roared  in  from  the  east. 

The  waiting  German  and  Italian  forces  massacred  them.  The  carefully 
planned  operation  failed  almost  completely.  At  the  three  North  African  air- 
ports of  Martuba,  El  Fetejak,  and  Barce,  not  a plane  was  touched;  at  the  k2 
and  k3  airfields,  the  British  succeeded  only  in  slightly  damaging  eight  craft, 
all  of  them  repairable  in  a few  days.  At  three  other  airfields  (Benina  in  North 
Africa  and  Heraklion  and  Castelli  in  Crete),  where  the  warnings  were  either 
not  received  or  ignored,  the  British  destroyed  a total  of  18  planes  and  burned 
two  hangars. 

Next  day,  airplanes  that  had  been  saved  from  destruction  by  the  timely 
warning  delivered  heavy  attacks  upon  the  convoy  from  Alexandria,  sinking 
three  destroyers  and  two  merchant  ships.  A U-boat  got  a heavy  cruiser,  and 
when  heavy  Italian  forces  sortied  from  Taranto,  the  convoy  turned  back 
under  this  threat  and  the  entire  operation  failed.  “The  approach  to  Malta 
from  the  eastward  remained  sealed,  and  no  convoy  again  attempted  this 
passage  until  November,”  wrote  Churchill.  “Thus,  in  spite  of  our  greatest 
efforts,  only  two  supply  ships  out  of  seventeen  got  through,  and  the  crisis  in 
the  island  continued.”  And  Rommel’s  pipeline  remained  open. 

With  his  gasoline  supplies  assured,  at  least  temporarily,  the  Desert  Fox 
swept  forward  in  the  onslaught  he  had  begun  on  the  moonlit  night  of  May 
26-27.  Complementing  the  strategic  intelligence  that  the  Fellers  intercepts 
were  providing  was  the  tactical  intelligence  from  his  highly  efficient  Fern- 
meldeaufklarung  Company  under  Captain  Alfred  Seebohm.  This  mobile 
outfit  tuned  into  every  British  8th  Army  radio  station,  picked  up  every  scrap 
of  chat,  ascertained  troop  and  tank  concentrations  and  movements  by  direc- 
tion-finding, learned  which  units  were  where  by  analyzing  call-signs,  studied 
British  cryptograms,  and  in  general  provided  Rommel  with  much  of  the  raw 
data  by  which  he  could  sniff  out  the  enemy’s  intentions.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Company  overheard  a radiotelephone  conversation  in  clear  at  10:30  a.m. 
June  16,  1942,  between  the  29th  Indian  Brigade  and  the  7th  Armored  Division. 
From  this  it  appeared  that  the  garrison  of  the  El  Adem  box,  or  strong  point, 
intended  to  attack  the  Germans  that  night.  The  information  was  passed  to 
Rommel  and  his  intrepid  90th  Light  Division,  who  attacked  at  once,  catching 
the  British  so  off  balance  that  instead  of  their  pummeling  the  Germans, 
Rommel  captured  El  Adem.  This  enabled  him  to  surround  and  isolate  Tobruk, 
which  unexpectedly  capitulated  on  the  20th,  allowing  enormous  quantities  of 
stores  to  fall  into  German  hands  and  giving  the  daring  Panzer  leader  his 
opportunity  to  strike  immediately  for  Suez.  It  was  aid  of  this  sort  that 
prompted  Rommel’s  intelligence  officer  to  call  Seebohm’s  Fernmeldeauf- 
klarung  Company  “a  very  important  factor  in  Rommel’s  victories.”  The  com- 
pany could  also  have  independently  read  the  Fellers  messages  with  a furnished 
copy  of  the  black  code  to  save  time  in  getting  the  information  to  Rommel. 

On  July  10,  the  swirling  desert  warfare  brought  the  Afrika  Korps  staff 
headquarters  directly  into  the  path  of  a British  armored  thrust.  In  a brief, 
fierce  spurt  of  action,  the  brilliant  Seebohm  was  killed  and  most  of  his  unit 
wiped  out  or  captured.  Many  of  their  records  fell  into  British  hands.  This  loss 
deprived  the  company’s  replacements  of  a great  deal  of  necessary  informa- 
tion, and  at  the  same  time  enabled  the  British  to  correct  many  radio-security 
mistakes.  Rommel  thus  lost  the  microscope  that  scrutinized  the  enemy  lines 
and  presented  to  him  so  many  bits  of  information. 

At  about  the  same  time  he  lost  his  telescope.  The  United  States  appears  to 
have  had  some  suspicion  of  the  leak  earlier  in  the  spring,  when  two  officers 
came  out  from  Washington  to  check  on  Fellers’  security  measures.  They 
cleared  him,  and  perhaps  this  lulled  their  fears  until  new  information  reached 
the  Allies.  Apparently  a prisoner  of  war  told  the  British  of  the  intercepts,  and 
the  British,  who  had  themselves  broken  the  black  code  and  its  superencipher- 
ment, using  it  to  read  other  traffic,  now  began  to  pick  up  Fellers’  messages 
within  an  hour  after  he  filed  them.  After  ten  days  of  studying  his  “long, 
detailed,  and  extremely  pessimistic”  reports,  they  notified  American  authori- 
ties late  in  June  of  the  leak  and  perhaps  of  Fellers’  attitude.  Fellers  himself 
was  never  told  of  the  German  solutions,  but  was  recalled  to  Washington, 
returning  in  July.*  Later  messages  from  Cairo  still  contained  some  note- 
worthy observations  but  no  broad  view  of  the  situation.  And  when  the  new 
military  attache  there  began  using  the  m-138  strip  cipher,  which  defied  all 
Axis  attempts  at  solution,  it  cut  Rommel  off  from  the  strategic  intelligence  on 
which  he  had  so  long  depended. 

The  loss  occurred  just  as  he  was  crossing  the  frontier  into  Egypt  and 
seemed  to  have  the  Pyramids  and  victory  almost  within  his  grasp.  The  British 

* Later  in  1942  he  was  awarded  the  Distinguished  Service  Medal  for  his  work  as  military 
attache,  which  “contributed  materially  to  the  tactical  and  technical  development  of  our 
Armed  Forces.”  The  citation  also  stated  that  “His  reports  to  the  War  Department  were 
models  of  clarity  and  accuracy.” 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  The  Axis

8th  Army  fell  back  to  its  fortified  positions  at  El  Alamein,  and  on  July  2 
Auchinleck  jabbed  out  with  the  first  of  a series  of  counterattacks.  Rommel, 
deprived  of  his  most  valuable  source  of  information,  could  no  longer  take  the 
expeditious  measures  for  defense  and  offense  that  he  was  previously  enabled 
to.  On  July  4,  he  reported  that  he  was  going  over  to  the  defensive.  Meanwhile, 
Britain  succeeded  in  reinforcing  Malta,  and  attacks  from  there  pinched  the 
Axis  pipeline.  Rommel  clamored  in  vain  for  fuel. 

At  the  same  time,  the  8th  Army  built  up  a powerful  force  in  secrecy,  and 
concealed  not  only  the  date  but  the  direction  of  its  main  thrust.  Two  divisions 
arrived  with  240  guns  and  150  tanks.  In  the  old  days,  the  Afrika  Korps  would 
have  learned  of  it  from  Fellers’  messages;  this  time  they  never  knew  the  two 
were  there.  The  British  had  profited  from  their  capture  of  the  Fernmeldeauf- 
klarung  files  to  institute  an  improved  call-sign  procedure,  tauten  cryptographic 
discipline  forward  of  divisional  headquarters,  introduce  radiotelephone  codes, 
impose  rigid  wireless  silence  on  reserve  formations,  pad  out  real  messages 
with  dummy  traffic,  and  create  an  entire  fake  signals  network  in  the  southern 
sector.  The  new  Fernmeldeaufklarung  staff  had  neither  the  talent  nor  the 
experience  to  penetrate  these  disguises  and  sift  the  true  from  the  false.  The 
Germans,  who  had  been  used  to  the  constant  flow  of  information  from 
Seebohm’s  men,  had  to  depend  almost  exclusively  upon  air  reconnaissance, 
without  any  radio-intelligence  corrective.  And  camouflage  fooled  it.  Hun- 
dreds of  tanks  and  guns  were  hidden  beneath  dummy  trucks;  large  supply 
depots  were  created  so  slowly  in  the  south  that  it  looked  as  if  they  could  not 
be  ready  for  several  months. 

So  when  General  Bernard  Montgomery  opened  fire  with  a thousand 
cannon  on  the  German  positions  at  Alamein  on  October  23,  it  came  as  a 
complete  surprise  to  the  Afrika  Korps.  Rommel  had  been  so  certain  that 
nothing  would  happen  for  a while  that  he  had  gone  to  Austria  to  convalesce. 
He  flew  back  at  once  to  take  personal  charge  of  the  battle,  but  by  the  time 
he  arrived  it  had  already  been  lost.  Hampered  by  shortages  of  oil,  men,  and 
armor,  he  could  only  shift  his  divisions  about  in  desperate  but  futile  attempts 
to  recover.  The  defeat  became  a rout,  and  the  Afrika  Korps  fled  west  across 
the  desert,  leaving  a battlefield  littered  with  hundreds  of  destroyed  or  useless 
tanks  and  troop-carriers.  A few  months  later  the  Germans  were  driven  out 
of  Africa,  then  out  of  Crete,  then  up  the  boot  of  Italy — always  retreating, 
never  again  advancing.  The  Battle  of  Alamein  marked  the  turning  of  the 
Allied  hinge  of  fate.  “Before  Alamein  we  never  had  a victory,”  Churchill  said. 
“After  Alamein  we  never  had  a defeat.” 

That  change  in  fortune  had  revolved,  to  no  small  degree,  upon  cryptology.

DUEL  IN  THE  ETHER: 
NEUTRALS  AND  ALLIES 


the  belligerents  were  not  the  only  ones  who  availed  themselves  of  the 
valuable  intelligence  of  cryptanalysis.  Vichy  France,  for  example,  installed 
about  50  cryptanalysts  and  clerks  in  a villa  outside  Lyons.  Their  success 
seems  to  have  been  limited.  A newspaper  story  reported  their  1941  failure  to 
solve  the  systems  of  former  French  Minister  of  the  Interior  Georges  Mandel, 
Churchill’s  friend,  then  in  Vichy  custody  for  his  attempt  to  set  up  a resistance 
government  in  North  Africa  with  himself  as  premier  after  the  fall  of  France. 
At  least  part  of  their  work  was  directed  at  the  Free  French  and  the  under- 
ground, but  they  never  communicated  any  of  their  results  to  the  Germans.  In 
fact,  one  member  of  the  bureau,  Charles  Eyraud,  later  known  as  the  author 
of  a fine  modern  work  on  cryptanalysis,  himself  burned  all  the  bureau’s  papers 
when  the  Germans  occupied  all  of  France. 

Almost  certainly  the  best  of  the  nonbelligerent  cryptanalysts,  and  perhaps 
one  of  the  best  in  the  war,  was  that  of  the  precarious  neutral,  Sweden.  At  first 
she  used  codebreaking  primarily  to  see  whether  Hitler  planned  to  grant  her 
the  same  sort  of  military  protection  that  he  so  generously  accorded  Norway 
and  Denmark.  His  preparation  for  occupying  those  two  countries  was  one  of 
the  best-kept  secrets  of  the  war,  and  Sweden  did  not  want  to  be  caught 
napping.  Later  she  used  the  intelligence  to  keep  abreast  of  a variety  of 
political  events. 

Except  for  a brief  interlude  back  about  the  turn  of  the  century,  when  R. 
Torpadie  so  impressed  the  Swedish  authorities  by  solving  a nomenclator  of 
1632  for  a historical  study  that  they  commissioned  him  to  set  up  a cryptologic 
bureau  called  Room  100,  Swedish  cryptology  got  its  real  start  with  Yves 
Gylden.  His  father,  Olof,  the  head  of  the  Royal  Naval  School,  had  been 
financially  interested  in  Arvid  Damm’s  cipher  machines.  Yves,  who  got  his 
un-Swedish  first  name  from  his  French  mother,  became  cryptologically 
interested  and  subjected  them  to  every  possible  cryptanalytic  test.  The 
interest  thus  kindled  in  cryptology  remained  with  him  throughout  a business 
career  with  the  pharmaceutical  firm  of  Astra,  founded  by  his  grandfather.  In 
1931,  a tall,  grave  man  of  36,  Gylden  published  his  Chijferbyraernas  insatser

Duel  in  the  Ether:  Neutrals  and  Allies 


479 


i varldskriget  till  lands , a keen,  perceptive  study  of  World  War  I cryptology 
and  its  effects.  Its  139  pages  were  later  translated  into  English  by  the  U.S. 
Army  Signal  Corps  as  The  Contributions  of  the  Cryptographic  Bureaus  in  the 
World  War,  and  portions  were  published  in  the  Revue  Militaire  Frangaise. 
This  book  demolished  the  lingering  myth  of  chamber  analysis,  demonstrated 
the  crucial  role  of  errors  and  of  torrents  of  ciphertext,  and  generally  crystal- 
lized the  lessons  of  World  War  I and  catalyzed  the  evolution  of  the 
cryptology  of  today. 

Five  years  after  the  influential  little  book  was  published,  Sweden  set  up  a 
cryptologic  bureau.  It  was  headed  by  Colonel  C.  G.  Warburg,  a gentleman 
who  had  fallen  off  a horse,  broken  both  arms  and  legs,  and  needed  a sine- 
cure. He  proved  as  incompetent  in  cryptology  as  in  equitation,  and  was 
replaced  by  a naval  officer  who  won  the  respect  of  the  experts  who  later 
served  under  him.  During  the  late  1930s  Gylden  gave  many  talks  on  crypt- 
analysis to  Swedes.  He  also  sowed  the  seeds  of  a valuable  cooperation  with 
the  other  Scandinavian  countries  when  he  lectured  in  Oslo  and  stimulated  a 
Captain  Rocher-Lund  to  set  up  Norway's  first  cryptologic  office.  In  1939, 
during  a 12-hour  war  game,  Gylden  headed  the  cryptanalytical  office  that 
solved  38  of  the  56  rather  simple  cryptograms  transmitted  by  the  “invaders.” 
Sweden's  preparations  extended  to  recruiting  talks  at  Uppsala  University, 
where  coeds  were  entertained  with  the  intrigues  of  cryptology  and  sold  on  the 
idea  that  they  could  become  good  codebreakers.  Other  personnel  were  drawn 
from  the  winners  of  cipher-solving  contests  which  the  cryptanalysts  got  the 
newspapers  to  run. 

When  war  broke  out,  the  Swedish  cryptanalysts  numbered  22.  All  were 
paid  the  magnificent  sum  of  half  a crown  a day  (raised  later  by  stages  to  two 
crowns),  as  a result  of  which  most  of  them  engaged  in  a kind  of  part-time 
cryptanalysis — working  for  the  government  in  the  morning  and  at  regular 
jobs  to  get  money  to  live  on  in  the  afternoon.  They  were  installed  first  in  the 
Gray  House,  Sweden’s  Defense  Ministry  building,  and  afterwards  in  an  old 
house  at  Carlaplan  4,  since  demolished  and  replaced  by  Sveriges  Radio;  they 
finally  settled  down  in  an  old,  drafty,  noncentrally-heated  apartment  house  at 
Styrmans-gatan  2.  (A  branch  was  also  established  in  a modern  apartment 
house  in  Strandvagen  in  1943.) 

In  1940  the  cryptanalysts  were  divided  by  language,  though  some  of  the 
mathematicians  shifted  from  group  to  group.  The  four  units  were:  No.  1,  for 
Romance  languages,  primarily  French  and  Italian,  headed  by  Gylden,  who 
had  spent  ten  years  in  France  and  was  fluent  in  that  language;  No.  2,  for 
German,  in  which  one  of  the  brightest  workers  was  Carl-Otto  Segerdahl,  a 
young  mathematician;  No.  3,  for  English,  which  attacked  American  and 
British  systems  and  was  headed  by  Dr.  Olof  von  Feilitzen,  32,  a librarian 
whose  English  is  better  than  that  of  many  Americans;  No.  4,  for  Russian, 
headed  by  Dr.  Arne  Beurling,  35,  a big,  slow-talking,  quietly  handsome  profes- 
sor of  mathematics  at  Uppsala  University,  who  in  1952  became  a member  of

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  Institute  for  Advanced  Study  at  Princeton.  Beurling,  one  of  the  war's  finest 
cryptanalysts,  also  determined  the  unknown  ciphers  of  other  countries  and 
made  the  initial  breaks.  Gylden,  as  the  founder,  was  a kind  of  first  among 
equals ; he  also  taught  new  recruits.  These  came  in  at  such  a pace  that  by  the 
time  he  left  in  1941  the  group  had  grown  to  500,  and  by  the  end  of  the  war  to 
1,000. 

Messages,  too,  poured  in.  Teletypewriters,  cut  directly  into  Swedish  post- 
office  circuits,  duplicated  messages  sent  over  those  wires.  Norway,  Denmark, 
and  Finland  forwarded  their  intercepts  to  Sweden,  which  had  the  only  effec- 
tive cryptanalytic  center  among  them,  and  these  messages  enabled  Sweden  to 
make  very  fruitful  comparisons  between  the  same  text  enciphered  in  different 
keys.  She  paid  her  Nordic  associates  back  with  the  information  gained  in  the 
resultant  cryptanalysis — sometimes  with  valuable  results. 

Early  in  1940,  just  before  the  German  occupation  of  Norway,  Nazi  agents 
there,  who  were  concentrated  in  the  German-Norwegian  shipping  lines  and 
in  the  large  fishing  and  fish-processing  firms,  were  ordered  to  pass  back  in- 
formation on  ship  movements  and  weather.  They  disguised  the  data  as  sales 
prices,  offers,  and  tonnage  reports  on  fishing,  and  transmitted  by  telephone 
and  radio.  But  the  Norwegian  authorities  had  intercepted  the  telephone  calls, 
which  dealt  with  prices  in  a highly  suspicious  manner.  They  sent  recordings  to 
Sweden,  where  Segerdahl  discovered  that  the  five-digit  “prices”  actually 
represented  the  transposed  and  monalphabetically  enciphered  numbers  of 
ships  in  Lloyd's  Register.  The  solutions  enabled  Norway  to  break  up  at  least 
one  of  the  rings  in  February,  though  others  continued  to  operate. 

The  Swedes  not  only  used  cryptology  against  foreign  espionage,  they 
sometimes  used  espionage  against  foreign  cryptology.  In  one  case,  they  tapped 
a telephone  call  between  the  Italian  military  attache  in  Stockholm  and  his 
colleague  in  Oslo.  The  recording  sounded  absolutely  unintelligible,  and  the 
Swedes  at  first  thought  that  the  Italians  had  used  a telephone  scrambler. 
When  they  determined  that  they  had  not,  the  recording  was  sent  to  the 
language  department  at  Uppsala,  where  it  was  found  to  be  a Sicilian  dialect 
rendered  incomprehensible  by  the  attache’s  over-liberal  use  of  cursewords. 
Eventually  the  sense  was  sorted  out,  and  the  conversation  proved  to  comprise 
the  Stockholm  attache’s  explanations  of  how  to  use  the  military  attache  code, 
which  the  Oslo  man — who  was  railing  at  the  idiots  in  Rome  who  would  send 
him  such  a code — could  not  fathom.  Between  the  explosions  of  the  colorful 
Sicilian  equivalents  for  “dunce”  and  “jackass”  and  still  other  expletives 
were  references  to  operating  procedure,  meanings  of  specific  codewords,  and 
so  on.  Needless  to  say,  it  proved  a great  help  to  Gylden  in  his  Italian-code 
solutions. 

The  Swedes  also  obtained  much  help  from  their  own  Foreign  Office  in  the 
form  of  diplomatic  notes  sent  and  received,  reports  of  notes  verbales,  aides- 
memoires  of  conversations  with  various  ambassadors,  and  other  memoranda. 
This  is  common  practice  in  all  countries,  but  the  Swedish  cryptanalysts  carried

it  to  a peak  of  perfection  by  using  as  their  liaison  man  a former  foreign  minis- 
ter. Rickard  Sandler,  56,  had  served  in  that  post  from  1932  to  1939;  he  had 
also  filled  in  as  premier  for  18  months  in  1925  and  1926,  and  in  1934  had  been 
elected  president  of  the  League  of  Nations  Assembly.  Spare  and  round-faced, 
Sandler  had  been  bitten  by  the  cryptology  bug,  and  in  1943  he  wrote  a book 
on  famous  ciphers.  But  he  proved  inept  as  a cryptanalyst,  unable  to  solve 
what  the  Swedes  regarded  as  the  simplest  of  practical  problems — Norwegian 
one-part  codes.  However,  he  was  a great  success  in  making  sure  that  the 
Foreign  Office  reported  every  scrap  of  information  promptly  to  the  crypt- 
analysts. So  well  did  he  have  his  contacts  trained  that  the  Foreign  Office  even 
reported  the  time  of  departure  of  an  ambassador’s  car  from  the  Foreign  Office 
building.  With  this  little  datum,  the  cryptanalysts — knowing  the  message  he 
had  been  given  and  estimating  how  long  it  would  take  the  ambassador  to 
drive  to  the  embassy  and  have  a message  of  that  length  encoded  and  sent  to 
the  telegraph  office — could  more  easily  pick  out  the  cryptogram  correspond- 
ing to  that  message  from  the  embassy’s  daily  file. 

As  usual,  the  Swedish  cryptanalysts  were  greatly  helped  by  lazy  or  stupid 
encoders.  Clerks  repeatedly  violated  the  most  elementary  rules  by  failing  to 
superencipher  and  forgetting  to  bisect  messages.  The  worst  bungler  the 
Swedes  came  across  was  the  German  consul  at  Stavanger,  whose  numerous 
blunders  became  the  vulnerable  heel  of  many  a German  message.  His  name — 
almost  too  fittingly — was  F.  W.  Achilles.  The  Swedes  appreciated  his  help  so 
much  that  they  hung  a large  photograph  of  him  in  their  office.  “He  was  very 
fat  and  he  looked  like  a gorilla,”  Segerdahl  said.  “I  never  met  the  man  person- 
ally, but  I considered  him  my  best  friend  in  the  German  diplomatic  service!” 

The  Swedes  also  read  messages  in  other  German  systems — a double 
transposition  for  the  military  attache  and  two  substitution  systems  for  the 
troops.  The  latter  gave  them  an  unexpected  peek  into  the  sex  habits  of 
German  soldiers.  The  Wehrmacht  provided  women  from  the  Baltic  states  and 
concentration  camps  as  prostitutes  for  the  occupation  forces  in  Norway,  and 
the  vessels  were  naturally  awaited  with  great  eagerness.  Their  arrivals  and 
departures  formed  the  subject  of  excited  communication  between  units,  and 
not  infrequently  a radioman  in  a port  from  which  a ship  had  just  sailed  would 
recommend  one  of  the  girls  to  a fellow  signalman  in  the  port  to  which  the  ship 
was  headed.  The  reasons  were  sometimes  quite  specific,  and  the  Swedes  came 
to  think  that  they  knew  the  girls  almost  as  well  by  cryptologic  means  as  the 
soldiers  did  by  carnal. 

But  errors,  circular  messages,  and  all  the  other  aids  would  not  have  helped 
the  Swedes  much  if  they  were  not  as  clever  as  they  were.  They  became  so 
attuned  to  French  procedure  in  regard  to  a multiplicity  of  codes — at  one  time 
the  French  had  eleven  in  simultaneous  use — that  they  could  tell  when  the 
French  regarded  them  as  compromised  (after  about  four  years)  and  began 
sending  material  in  them  that  they  wanted  others  to  read.  Usually  this  tried  to 
implant  the  idea  that  the  French  were  acting  only  out  of  the  most  moral

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


considerations  in  a given  situation,  probably  to  distract  attention  from  their  real 
motives.  Many  phrases  from  the  messages  in  these  compromised  codes  later 
showed  up  in  the  French  Yellow  Books,  the  official  governmental  statements  of 
their  positions.  The  Swedes  also  solved  an  American-British  code  in  which  U- 
boat  warnings  were  transmitted — probably  the  same  that  Germany’s  B-Dienst 
read — and  thus  got  a free  ride  in  safeguarding  their  own  merchantmen. 

Quite  possibly  the  finest  feat  of  cryptanalysis  performed  by  the  Swedes, 
and  the  most  far-reaching,  was  Arne  Beurling’s  solution  of  the  German 
Siemens  machine.  Since  German  messages  passed  over  Swedish  wires  just  as 
German  soldiers  passed  over  Swedish  rails,  both  the  Wehrmacht  in  Norway 
and  the  German  embassy  in  Stockholm  took  advantage  of  the  machine’s  on- 
line capabilities  to  wire  messages  directly  to  Berlin.  The  German  Foreign 
Office  called  the  machine  the  Geheimschreiber  (“secret  writer”).  The  tele- 
printers in  the  Swedish  cryptanalytic  bureau  rapped  out  the  German  cor- 
respondence, and  it  was  given  to  Beurling  for  an  attempt  at  solution. 

He  observed  at  once  that  the  ciphertext  consisted  of  the  26  letters  and  six 
digits,  a total  of  32  characters,  or  25.  This  suggested  a cipher  based  on  a 
teletypewriter  to  him,  since  he  knew  that  teletypewriters  used  a five-hole 
punched  tape.  That  was  about  all  he  knew,  though,  and  he  had  to  get  a book 
on  them  to  see  how  they  worked.  His  studies — perhaps  aided  by  an  examina- 
tion of  patents — led  him  to  the  conclusion  that  a machine  based  on  the 
Baudot  code  would  encipher  by  shifting  the  positions  of  the  five  contacts, 
that  each  of  these  positions  would  very  likely  be  controlled  by  a keywheel 
of  its  own,  and  that  the  number  of  control  pins  on  the  circumference  of 
these  wheels  would  vary  from  wheel  to  wheel  to  make  the  period  as  long  as 
possible. 

Since  the  key  probably  changed  daily,  Beurling  selected  the  traffic  for  a 
single  day,  May  25,  1940,  to  work  on.  It  covered  the  equivalent  of  two  large 
sheets  of  paper.  His  analysis  soon  showed  that  his  preliminary  suppositions 
were  correct,  except  that  the  substitution  of  the  Baudot  pulses  was  followed 
by  a transposition.  Very  often  the  transposition  had  no  effect.  If,  for  example, 
pulses  1 and  2 were  the  same,  the  transposition  of  1,  2,  3,  4,  5 into  2,  1,  3,  4,  5 
would  leave  the  character  unchanged.  Beurling  took  full  advantage  of  these 
peculiarities  to  reconstruct  the  mechanism.  He  checked  his  work  with  new 
data  from  the  traffic  of  May  27,  found  it  was  correct,  and  within  two  weeks  of 
undertaking  the  job  had  solved  the  cipher.  A Swedish  mechanic  constructed 
an  apparatus  to  Beurling’s  specifications,  and  though  it  looked  monstrous 
and  made  a terrific  racket,  it  printed  out  the  German  messages  that  the 
Swedes  wanted  to  read. 

To  recover  the  daily  keys,  the  cryptanalysts  would  work  through  the  night, 
and  in  the  morning,  when  the  Swedish  commander,  Lieutenant  General  OIov 
Thornell,  came  in  to  ask,  “What’s  the  news  from  the  Germans  today?”  they 
were  usually  able  to  tell  him.  Twice  when  the  Germans  made  threatening 
moves  with  their  troops  in  Norway  toward  Sweden,  Swedish  troops,  alerted 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  Neutrals  and  Allies

by  cryptanalyzed  messages,  moved  swiftly  into  position  and  blocked  the 
Germans.  Their  commander,  General  Niklaus  von  Falkenhorst,  later  ex- 
tended congratulations  to  Thornell  on  the  brilliance  of  his  tactics.  Thornell 
passed  the  felicitations  on  to  the  cryptanalysts. 

In  the  spring  of  1941,  the  Swedes  cryptanalyzed  other  German  military 
messages  that,  put  together,  spelled  an  invasion  of  Russia  between  June  20 
and  25.  Erik  Bohemann,  secretary  general  of  the  Swedish  Foreign  Office, 
passed  the  information  to  Sir  Stafford  Cripps,  British  ambassador  to  the 
Soviet  Union,  at  a dinner  in  Stockholm  while  Cripps  was  passing  through. 
This  may  not  have  come  as  news  to  Cripps,  who  may  have  known  of  the 
invasion  from  other  sources,  but  it  certainly  reinforced  any  knowledge  he 
had.  Unfortunately,  Stalin  did  not  believe  the  British. 

The  dozens  of  diplomatic  messages  that  clattered  out  of  the  Beurling 
mechanism  told  the  Swedish  Foreign  Office  what  the  Germans  were  really 
doing  and  thinking.  They  gave  Foreign  Minister  Christian  Gunther  advance 
warning  of  diplomatic  notes  that  the  German  embassy  was  ordered  to  submit 
to  him.  The  cryptanalysts  tell  a story  that,  after  reading  a particularly  demand- 
ing note,  they  took  the  unusual  step  of  notifying  Gunther  of  its  contents  by 
telephone,  which  they  rarely  used.  (Later  they  sent  it  over  by  the  regular 
messenger,  who  wore  two  shoulder  holsters.)  Gunther  promptly  went  on  a 
“hunting  trip,”  and  the  German  diplomat  could  not  serve  his  demand  until 
after  the  weekend.  By  then  the  Swedes  had  formulated  a policy  that  enabled 
them  to  tell  the  Germans,  with  suitable  regret,  that  they  were  unable  to  fulfill 
the  requests. 

And  so  Sweden’s  cryptanalysts  helped  her  navigate  the  perilous  waters  of 
neutrality  while  all  about  her  raged  the  war. 

Great  Britain’s  main  cryptanalytic  agency  lay  within  her  Foreign  Office, 
which  had  taken  over  the  personnel  of  the  Admiralty’s  Room  40  at  the  end  of 
World  War  I.  The  Reverend  William  Montgomery,  one  of  the  solvers  of  the 
Zimmermann  telegram,  for  example,  joined  the  Foreign  Office.  Early  in  the 
1920s,  in  a circular  urging  its  diplomats  to  be  more  careful  in  the  use  of  their 
codes,  the  Foreign  Office  told  them  that  it  was  spending  £12,000  a year,  or 
almost  $60,000,  both  in  keeping  British  codes  secret  and  in  solving  those  of 
foreign  governments,  and  that  carelessness  in  handling  codes  was  wasting 
much  of  this  (or  at  least  much  of  the  part  spent  for  British  cryptography). 
The  usual  legends  circulated  among  the  diplomats  about  their  code  experts, 
some  of  whom  had  “made  a life-long  study  of  the  work.”  One  story  credited 
one  of  these  wizards  with  solving  a Turkish  code  during  the  war  in  less  than 
five  months,  though  he  himself  could  not  speak  Turkish  and  had  had  to  call  in 
experts  in  the  language  to  translate  the  messages.  The  Foreign  Office  re- 
portedly considered  no  code  as  fully  secret  after  it  had  been  used  for  six 
months;  consequently  it  changed  all  highly  confidential  codes  every  four 
months.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


In  1939,  the  Foreign  Office  moved  what  it  euphemistically  called  its 
Department  of  Communications  to  Bletchley  Park,  an  estate  and  mansion  in 
Bletchley,  a town  in  Buckinghamshire  about  50  miles  northwest  of  London. 
It  is  far  and  away  the  most  history-redolent  black  chamber  of  all.  The  British, 
of  course,  trace  the  land  from  a Roman  encampment,  through  its  award  by 
William  the  Conquerer  to  Bishop  Geoffrey  of  Constance  for  services  rendered 
at  the  Battle  of  Hastings,  down  on  through  the  ownership  of  various  lords 
(most  notably  the  two  George  Villierses,  first  and  second  dukes  of  Bucking- 
ham) and  rich  men  of  decreasing  interest.  A mansion  was  first  built  on  the 
land  in  the  1870s  and  added  to  repeatedly;  the  Foreign  Office,  finding  this  too 
small,  added  many  buildings,  including  a cafeteria  and  a large  hall.  Eventu- 
ally 7,000  worked  and  trained  there,  including  members  of  the  armed  services. 


CODING  ORGANIZATION 


Britain  urges  cryptographic  discipline 


The  War  Office  expanded  its  M.I.  1(b),  the  cryptanalytic  agency  started  in 
World  War  I under  Major  Hay,  to  M.I.  8 — the  same  name,  coincidentally,  as 
that  held  by  Yardley’s  organization.  The  Admiralty  and  the  Air  Ministry 
presumably  had  cryptologic  agencies  of  their  own.  One  of  the  first  victories 
of  the  Admiralty’s  unit  was,  surprisingly,  in  the  domain  of  cryptography. 

Since  the  beginning  of  the  war,  Admiralty  secret  communications  had  been 
read  by  the  B-Dienst,  with  such  disastrous  results  as  the  loss  of  Norway 
almost  by  default.  The  Germans  continued  to  listen  in  to  Admiralty  messages 
during  the  critical  summer  of  1940  as  Hitler  prepared  for  Operation  sealion — 
his  invasion  of  England.  The  cryptanalytic  intelligence  had  long  been  entering 
into  operational  planning,  and  the  Oberkommando  der  Kriegsmarine  had 
come  to  depend  on  it.  Suddenly,  on  August  20,  as  all  England  was  bracing 
itself  in  its  finest  hour,  and  the  sky  above  was  streaked  with  contrails  as  the 
few  earned  their  tribute  from  the  many,  the  Admiralty,  which  had  finally 
tumbled  to  the  German  cryptanalysis,  changed  its  codes  and  ciphers.  O.K.M. 
went  deaf.  The  abrupt  cutting  off  of  quantities  of  information  about  British

plans  and  dispositions  caused,  a German  said,  “a  great  setback  for  German 
naval  strategy.”  No  longer  could  German  vessels  strike  out  at  the  greater 
British  forces  with  foreknowledge  or  move  deftly  out  of  their  way.  British 
sea  power  rapidly  gained  its  normal  ascendancy.  English  ships  shelled  the 
invasion  fleet  in  Channel  ports.  Air  reconnaissance  alone  could  not  tell  the 
Germans  enough.  The  O.K.M.,  never  very  warm  for  sealion,  chilled  still 
further.  Eventually  its  coolness  spread  throughout  O.K.W.,  and  then  to 
Hitler.  It  contributed  to  his  ultimate  decision  to  postpone  sealion  indefinitely, 
and  hence  forever. 

All  of  Britain’s  cryptologic  work  seems  to  have  been  coordinated  by  the

threatens 

Foreign  Office’s  Department  of  Communications,  which  apparently  handled 
strategic  and  primary  cryptosystem  solutions.  All  over  the  world,  Britain  had 
about  30,000  persons  in  communications  intelligence.  Deputy  director  ot 
the  Department  of  Communications  was  a man  who  had  already  made  a 
mark  in  the  world  by  his  cryptanalytic  efforts.  He  was  Nigel  de  Grey,  who  in 
1917  had  solved  the  Zimmermann  telegram. 

The  department  turned  out  solutions  at  a fairly  rapid  rate.  On  November 
21,  1941,  a Japanese  diplomatic  solution  was  given  number  097975,  on 
December  12,  another  Japanese  diplomatic  solution  was  numbered  098846 
—indicating  almost  300  solutions  a week  at  that  time  (not  Japanese  alone,  of 
course).  A typical  distribution  of  these  solutions  would  send  three  copies  each 
to  the  director  of  the  department,  the  Foreign  Office,  and  the  War  Office,  two 
to  the  India  Office,  and  one  each  to  the  Admiralty,  the  Air  Ministry,  the 
Colonial  Office,  the  Dominion  Office,  M.I.  5 (counterintelligence),  and  Sir

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Edward  Bridges,  secretary  to  the  Cabinet.  The  appearance  of  Bridges’  name 
on  the  list  suggests  that  some  of  the  British  intercepts  may  have  been  read 
aloud  at  Cabinet  meetings.  In  addition,  Churchill,  on  August  5,  1940,  ordered 
that  a daily  selection  of  original  intelligence  documents  be  submitted  to  him 
personally  “in  their  original  form,”  which  almost  certainly  included  inter- 
cepts. Much  of  the  cryptanalytic  output  must  have  gone  to  the  Joint  Intellig- 
ence Committee,  which  evaluated  all  intelligence.  It  was  always  chaired  by  a 
Foreign  Office  representative,  who  was  Victor  F.  W.  Cavendish-Bentinck 
throughout  most  of  the  war,  and  included  the  directors  of  military,  naval,  and 
air  intelligence. 

The  intelligence  from  these  solutions  went  also  to  the  United  States,  but  so 
closely  did  Britain  guard  her  cryptanalytic  capabilities  that  for  more  than  a 
year  she  would  give  the  United  States  information  based  on  the  cryptanalyses 
but  would  not  name  the  source.  In  January,  1941,  however,  a four-man 
American  cryptanalytic  mission  accompanied  a purple  machine  to  England 
to  establish  technical  cooperation  with  British  cryptanalysts.  Britain  had  not 
cracked  the  purple  machine,  but  they  had  more  in  the  way  of  cryptanalyzed 
intercepts  than  the  United  States,  and  this  was  the  quid  pro  quo.  This  co- 
operation between  the  two  English-speaking  nations  in  the  most  sensitive  of 
areas  tells  the  depths  of  their  friendship.  The  American  Signal  Intelligence 
Service  and  op-20-g  radioed  the  purple  keys  to  London  daily.  Cooperation 
extended  to  the  small  Australian  communications-intelligence  unit  and  to 
the  unit  at  Singapore,  and  Canada  assisted  in  making  sure  that  all  got  all 
Japanese  intercepts. 

Some  of  the  most  important  British  communications  intelligence  resulted, 
however,  not  from  the  scribblings  and  quiet  cogitations  of  reticent  crypt- 
analysts, but  from  the  explosive  sexual  charms  of  a British  secret  agent  in 
America.  Her  unlocking  of  several  hearts  gave  Britain  access  to  vast  treasuries 
of  intelligence.  She  was  an  American,  the  daughter  of  a Marine  Corps  Major. 
Her  real  name  was  Amy  Elizabeth  Thorpe  but  she  was  known  in  espionage 
by  her  codename,  cynthia.  She  had  had  her  first  sexual  experience  at  14, 
and  was  pregnant  when,  at  19,  she  married  a junior  British  diplomat,  whom 
she  later  divorced;  at  the  start  of  her  espionage  work  she  had  just  turned 
30.  A moderately  attractive  blond,  tall  and  with  prominent  features,  soft- 
voiced,  a good  listener,  and  with  a sensuality  that  was  indefinable  but  very 
much  present,  she  served  British  Security  Coordination,  Britain’s  intelligence 
organization  in  the  United  States,  not  for  money,  but  for  thrills. 

In  the  winter  of  1940-1941,  B.S.C.  assigned  cynthia  the  task  of  obtaining 
the  Italian  naval  cryptosystem.  She  managed  an  introduction  to  the  Italian 
naval  attache  in  the  embassy  at  Washington,  Admiral  Alberto  Lais.  Within  a 
few  weeks  he  was  infatuated.  When  she  was  certain  of  her  power  over  him,  she 
told  him  directly  that  she  wanted  the  naval  code.  Lais,  despite  his  age  and 
experience,  agreed  without  any  protest  to  betray  his  country  for  a woman. 
He  arranged  for  her  to  meet  his  cipher  clerk,  who  produced  the  codebook 


487 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  Neutrals  and  Allies 

(and,  presumably,  any  superencipherment  tables  for  it)  for  a fee.  It  was 
promptly  photostated  and  returned  to  the  safe;  the  photostats  went  to 
London. 

A few  months  after  the  English  cryptanalysts  received  them,  Cynthia’s 
feat  paid  off.  As  Churchill  obliquely  put  it,  “Towards  the  end  of  March  [1941] 
it  was  evident  that  a major  movement  of  the  Italian  Fleet,  probably  towards 
the  Aegean,  was  impending.”  Admiral  Cunningham,  commanding  in  the 
Mediterranean,  whose  cryptanalytic  unit  probably  had  been  given  copies  of 
the  Italian  code  and  superencipherment,  sensed  by  March  25  the  Italian 
sortie  against  British  convoys  carrying  troops  to  aid  Greece.  Two  days  later 
he  slipped  out  of  Alexandria  after  dark  and  set  his  course  so  foresightedly 
that  at  dawn  a scouting  plane  contacted  the  enemy  squadron.  Though  the 
Italians  were  also  reading  Cunningham’s  messages  and  so  took  action  that 
increased  the  difficulty  of  his  attack,  he  destroyed  the  cruisers  Pola , Fiume, 
and  Zara , and  damaged  the  battleship  Vittorio  Veneto  in  the  Battle  of  Cape 
Matapan.  The  victory,  Churchill  said,  “disposed  of  all  challenge  to  British 
naval  mastery  in  the  Eastern  Mediterranean  at  this  critical  time.” 

A few  days  later,  the  State  Department  declared  Lais  persona  non  grata  as 
a result  of  sabotage  plans  that  he  had  disclosed  to  cynthia,  who  had  main- 
tained profitable  contact  with  him.  At  dockside,  he  spent  his  last  few  minutes 
with  cynthia,  ignoring  his  weeping  family.  His  departure  enabled  her  to 
turn  to  her  next  assignment,  at  the  embassy  of  Vichy  France. 

She  gained  entrance  by  posing  as  a newspaperwoman.  During  the  wait  to 
interview  the  ambassador,  she  chatted  for  an  hour  with  the  press  attache, 
Captain  Charles  Brousse— and  captivated  him.  By  July  of  1941,  after  allowing 
him  to  seduce  her,  she  “confided”  that  she  was  an  American  agent  and  urged 
him  to  work  for  the  real  France  against  the  Laval  government.  Soon  she  was 
getting  a plaintext  copy  of  every  incoming  and  outgoing  telegram  of  the 
embassy,  plus  a daily  report  that  Brousse  wrote  to  fill  in  the  missing  details. 

The  plaintext  undoubtedly  enabled  the  British  to  reconstruct  French 
diplomatic  codes,  if  they  had  not  already  done  so.*  But  in  March  of  1942, 
London  asked  British  Security  Coordination  to  obtain  the  French  naval  code, 
which  was  used  both  by  naval  attaches  and  fleet  commanders.  This  might 
have  stemmed  ultimately  from  an  order  by  Churchill  himself.  He  was  then 
mounting  a force  to  seize  French-owned  Madagascar  to  keep  it  from  becom- 
ing a Japanese  submarine  base  and  he  feared  that  Vichy  might  reinforce  the 
island  from  Dakar  just  on  the  possibility  that  England  might  attempt  such 
a seizure.  “I  therefore  asked  for  extreme  vigilance  about  any  convoys  or

shipping  which  might  pass  from  Dakar  to  the  island,  toward  which  our  forces 
were  already  about  to  start,”  he  wrote.  Supervision  of  Vichy  naval  signals 
constituted,  of  course,  one  aspect  of  this  vigilance. 

Cynthia  first  asked  her  lover  to  get  the  code  for  her,  but  he  replied  that  it 
was  an  impossible  task,  since  only  the  chief  of  the  code  room,  one  Benoit,  and 
his  assistant  had  access  to  that  tightly  guarded  sanctuary.  Cynthia  approached 
them,  but  failed  with  both. 

Undaunted,  she  switched  tactics.  She  and  Brousse — who  was  now  totally 
infatuated  and  willing  to  assist  her  in  any  of  her  plans — arrived  late  one  night 
at  the  embassy.  They  explained  as  tactfully  as  possible  to  the  watchman  the 
difficulty  of  obtaining  hotel  rooms  in  wartime  Washington  and,  smoothing 
his  qualms  with  a tip,  went  in  to  spend  the  night  on  a divan  on  the  first  floor. 
They  repeated  this  several  times,  until  the  watchman  became  used  to  it.  One 
night  in  June,  1942,  they  clambered  out  of  their  taxicab  in  festive  mood  with 
a bottle  of  champagne,  which  they  invited  the  watchman  to  share.  He  was 
happy  to  do  so.  A few  minutes  later,  he  had  sunk  into  a drugged  slumber. 
The  “cab  driver,”  an  expert  locksmith  working  for  B.S.C.,  worked  three 
hours  and  discovered  the  combination  of  the  safe  in  the  code  room.  But  he 
did  not  have  enough  time  to  take  the  codebooks  for  photostating,  and 
Cynthia  and  Brousse  had  to  return  two  nights  later. 

It  would  be  almost  impossible  to  drug  the  watchman  again;  and  further- 
more it  was  inadvisable,  for  Cynthia  felt  that  he  was  growing  mistrustful  of 
their  repeated  visits.  She  sensed  that  he  would  look  in  on  them  that  evening, 
and  so  she  prepared  a counterstratagem  that  would  allay  his  suspicions. 
When,  as  expected,  the  watchman  walked  into  the  room  twenty  minutes  later, 
she  was  totally  nude.  It  was  utterly  convincing.  The  watchman  retired  in 
confusion  and  did  not  bother  them  again. 

They  let  the  locksmith  in  through  a window;  he  removed  the  codebooks 
and  their  accompanying  tables  of  encipherment  and  handed  them  to  another  , 
agent  outside,  who  had  them  photostated  in  a nearby  house  by  other  B.S.C. 
operatives.  By  4 a.m.  they  were  back  in  their  safe  with  no  sign  that  they 
had  ever  been  abstracted;  24  hours  later  the  photostats  reached  England. 

It  was  by  then  too  late  to  help  with  the  capture  of  Madagascar,  which  had 
gone  off  without  a hitch  the  previous  month.  But  plans  were  now  afoot  for 
the  Allied  landing  in  North  Africa,  and  the  photostated  code  helped  keep  the 
Anglo-American  forces  informed  of  the  movement — or,  rather,  nonmove- 
ment—of  the  units  of  the  Vichy  French  fleet  at  Toulon,  Casablanca,  and 
Alexandria  during  the  invasion.  Thus  was  England  once  again  helped  by  a 
Lady  Godiva. 

No  such  dramatic  feats  were  required  by  the  British  or  by  anyone  else  to 
read  American  diplomatic  codes.  The  cryptanalysts  who  worked  on  them  did 
not  even  have  to  furrow  their  brows  excessively.  For  these  codes  of  a great 
power  were,  from  before  World  War  1 to  the  middle  of  World  War  II,  as  puny 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  Neutrals  and  Allies

as  those  of  many  smaller  nations.  The  United  States  must  have  been  the 
laughingstock  of  every  cryptanalyst  in  the  world.  And  during  World  War  I, 
the  twenties,  and  the  thirties,  American  diplomacy  must  have  been  conducted 
largely  in  an  international  goldfish  bowl. 

During  that  period,  the  Department  of  State  entrusted  its  code  compila- 
tion to  the  chief  of  its  Bureau  of  Indexes  and  Archives,  later  the  Division  of 
Communications  and  Records,  which  handled  both  the  code-making  and  the 
coding.  For  nearly  all  those  years,  the  post  was  held  by  David  A.  Salmon, 
a career  employee  whose  knowledge  of  cryptology  was  limited  to  what  he 
had  learned  on  the  job. 

He  inherited  from  his  predecessor,  John  R.  Buck,  the  practice  of  designat- 
ing American  diplomatic  codes  by  the  color  of  their  binding.  Thus,  since 
before  World  War  I,  the  United  States  had  had  a red  and  a blue  code,  both 
using  five-figure  groups.  The  red  was  the  older  of  the  two,  and  State  had 
given  the  Navy  some  copies  of  it  for  communication  at  outposts  between 
diplomats  and  naval  officers.  In  1912,  soon  after  Woodrow  Wilson  took 
office,  the  President’s  Commission  on  Economy  and  Efficiency  asked  the 
State,  War,  and  Navy  departments  to  consider  a standard  interdepartmental 
code  and  “better  and  less  expensive  methods  of  enciphering  cablegrams.” 
The  red  code  had  by  then  become,  in  Salmon’s  unconscious  pun,  an  “open 
book.”  Nearly  a year  later,  the  three  departments  finally  agreed  to  use,  as  an 
emergency  cryptosystem — the  Vigenere!  They  knew  it  in  a slightly  different 
arrangement,  called  the  Larrabee,  in  which  the  plaintext  alphabet  was 
repeated  above  each  ciphertext  alphabet  and  the  keyletter  was  printed  in 
large  type  at  the  left.  Cryptographically,  however,  it  was  identical  with  the 
system  that  Kasiski  had  demolished  half  a century  before.  Not  only  did  they 
merely  contemplate  using  the  system,  which  was  bad  enough;  they  actually 
did  use  it.  And  making  things  as  easy  as  possible  for  foreign  cryptanalysts 
were  the  short  keywords:  State  used  PEKIN  and  POKES  in  1917. 

Even  though  the  alphabet  card  on  which  the  Larrabee  was  sent  to 
American  diplomatic  and  consular  offices,  with  instructions  to  paste  it  inside 
the  cover  of  departmental  codebooks,  would  not  help  much  in  solution,  one 
nation  was  taking  no  chances.  Vice  Consul  General  Alfred  V.  Smith  wrote  on 
September  13,  1913:  “In  reference  to  Circular  Instruction  ‘Larrabee  Cipher’ 
of  March  8,  1913,  received  at  this  office  on  April  3rd  last,  I have  the  honor  to 
inform  the  Department  that  the  ‘Larrabee  Cipher  Code’  referred  to  in  the 
above  instruction  as  being  ‘transmitted  herewith,’  was  not  to  be  found  in  the 
envelope.”  Smith  was  in  charge  of  the  consulate  general  at  Moscow. 

In  October  it  was  learned  that  there  were  no  funds  available  for  the  pro- 
posed interdepartmental  code,  and  so  the  United  States  government  persisted 
in  the  amazing  cryptographic  imbecility  of  using  the  Larrabee  throughout 
World  War  I.  For  strictly  diplomatic  messages,  State  continued  to  use  red 
and  blue,  relying  increasingly  on  the  latter  as  the  former  declined  in  security. 
In  1915,  Mexicans  somehow  obtained  the  red  code  at  Vera  Cruz.  Across  the

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Atlantic,  the  American  minister  to  Rumania,  a former  politician,  found  it 
easier  to  keep  his  one  copy  under  his  mattress  than  to  fiddle  with  the  safe- 
combination.  It  disappeared  one  day,  reportedly  finding  its  way  to  St.  Peters- 
burg. The  minister  never  troubled  to  report  this  loss.  He  solved  the  potentially 
embarrassing  problem  of  not  being  able  to  read  incoming  messages  by  letting 
the  relatively  light  coded  traffic  pile  up,  then  hopping  a train  to  visit  the 
embassy  in  Vienna,  where  he  decoded  the  messages  which,  he  said,  had 
arrived  just  as  he  was  leaving.  At  the  same  time  he  composed  and  encoded 
his  replies.  When  the  war  came,  however,  traffic  increased,  the  artifice  no 
longer  applied,  and  he  admitted  his  dereliction  and  returned  to  politics. 

The  need  for  security  penetrated  the  departmental  bureaucracy  and  in 
1914  it  instituted  a “special  cipher,”  probably  a superencipherment  of  the 
existing  codes.  The  London  embassy  gleefully  hailed  it  as  a success  and  an 
ensurer  of  secrecy.  It  was  probably  only  a stopgap  until  the  State  Department 
could  compile  and  place  in  service  a new  code — the  green.  This  one-part  code 
used  five-letter  codegroups  of  the  form  cucuc  (c  = consonant  and  u = 
vowel);  thus  department  was  fytig,  message  was  mihak,  secured  from  was 
pedek,  secured  the,  pediv. 

Nevertheless,  by  the  time  the  United  States  entered  the  war,  every  major 
European  power  must  have  had  copies  of  one  or  more  American  diplomatic 
codes.  Foreign  employees  had  the  run  of  the  embassies,  and  it  would  have 
been  little  trouble  for  them  to  get  hold  of  the  books.  (One  of  the  first  German 
spies  arrested  was  the  clerk  to  the  commandant  at  Pearl  Harbor,  who  had 
access  to  the  Navy’s  most  secret  code.)  The  Germans  even  returned  a State 
Department  codebook  that  had  been  used  by  the  American  consulate  in 
Leipzig.  If  England’s  Room  40  could  solve  German  two-part  codes,  it  could 
certainly  read  the  simpler  American  ones,  and  in  fact  rumors  that  Britain  was 
doing  so  even  reached  the  newspapers.  During  the  war,  the  London  embassy 
reported  that  German  authorities  in  Spain  obtained  a copy  of  an  American 
cablegram  to  Valencia,  radioed  the  codetext  to  Germany,  and  promptly  got 
back  the  plaintext.  The  State  Department  attempted  to  counter  such  embar- 
rassments by  enciphering  the  green  code  with  a key  that  changed  monthly 
and  by  producing  a new  code  (“I  never  realized  until  now  what  an  arduous 
task  it  is  to  prepare  a wholly  new  cipher,”  sighed  Under  Secretary  William 
Phillips.) 

In  1919,  the  United  States,  which  Will  Rogers  said  never  lost  a war  nor 
won  a peace,  may  have  been  assisted  in  losing  the  current  peace  by  its  crypto- 
graphic practices.  The  American  Commission  to  Negotiate  Peace  furnished 
its  field  agents,  who  reported  to  it  on  the  conditions  and  aspirations  of  the 
little  peoples  of  Europe,  with  a publicly  available  commercial  code,  the 
Universal  Pocket  Code\  No  doubt  the  French  cryptanalysts  were  pleased  to 
see  their  work  thus  facilitated. 

The  new  code  that  Phillips  had  sighed  over  was  the  gray  code,  destined  to 
become  the  best  known  and  longest  lived  of  American  diplomatic  codes.  In

theory  it  was  a confidential  code:  when  a telegram  from  Mexico  reported  a 
rumor  that  that  country  had  obtained  an  American  code  (not  the  same  as  the 
red  stolen  earlier),  the  department  replied  that  gray  could  be  used  for 
confidential  messages.  But  a truer  picture  might  be  that  drawn  by  former  code 
clerk  James  Thurber,  who  served  with  the  peace  mission: 

All  our  code  books  except  one  were  quaint  transparencies  dating  back  to  the 
time  when  Hamilton  Fish  was  Secretary  of  State  under  President  Grant,  and 
they  were  intended  to  save  words  and  cut  telegraph  costs,  not  to  fool  anybody. 
The  new  code  book  had  been  put  together  so  hastily  that  the  word  “America” 
was  left  out,  and  code  groups  so  closely  paralleled  true  readings  that  lowe,  for 
example,  was  the  symbol  for  “love.” 

Whatever  slight  illusion  of  secrecy  we  code  clerks  may  have  had  was  dis- 
pelled one  day  by  a dour  gentleman  who  announced  that  the  Germans  had  all 
our  codes.  It  was  said  that  the  Germans  now  and  then  got  messages  through  to 
Washington  taunting  us  about  our  childish  ciphers,  and  suggesting  on  one 
occasion  that  our  clumsy  device  of  combining  two  codes,  in  a desperate  effort 
at  deception,  would  have  been  a little  harder  if  we  had  used  two  other  codes, 
which  they  named.  This  may  have  been  rumor  or  legend,  like  the  story,  current 
at  the  time,  that  six  of  our  code  books  were  missing  and  that  a seventh,  neatly 
wrapped,  firmly  tied,  and  accompanied  by  a courteous  note,  had  been  returned 
to  one  or  another  of  our  embassies  by  the  Japanese,  either  because  they  had 
finished  with  it  or  because  they  already  had  one. 

A system  of  deception  as  easy  to  see  through  as  the  passing  attack  of  a 
grammar-school  football  team  naturally  produces  a cat’s-out-of-the-bag  atti- 
tude. In  enciphering  messages  in  one  code,  in  which  the  symbol  for  “quote”  was 
(to  make  up  a group)  zoxil,  we  were  permitted  to  use  unzoxil  for  “unquote,” 
an  aid  to  perspicuity  that  gave  us  code  clerks  the  depressing  feeling  that  our 
tedious  work  was  merely  an  exercise  in  block  lettering.  The  Department  may 
have  comforted  itself  with  the  knowledge  that  even  the  most  ingenious  and  com- 
plex codes  could  have  been  broken  down  by  enemy  cipher  experts.  Unzoxilation 
just  made  it  a little  easier  for  them. 

So  did  the  continued  use  of  the  Larrabee.  In  1921  the  Navy  awoke  to  the 
danger.  Commander  Milo  F.  Draemel  conferred  with  Salmon,  and  the  two 
agreed  that  a double  transposition  cipher  would  afford  sufficient  security  for 
the  limited  State-Navy  communications.  But  not  until  almost  a year  later  did 
the  State  Department  finally  distribute  it  to  16  legations  and  59  consulates 
around  the  globe. 

What  also  made  the  work  of  foreign  cryptanalysts  easy  was  America’s 
continued  use,  year  after  year,  of  the  old  codes.  The  gray  code  especially 
became  so  familiar  to  American  foreign  service  officers  that  when  colleagues 
tendered  a senior  consul  at  Shanghai  his  retirement  dinner  late  in  the  decade, 
he  responded  with  a farewell  speech  in  gray — which  the  old-timers  followed 
with  ease.  By  then,  superenciphered  codes  called  A-l  and  b-1  had  been  intro- 
duced. In  1925,  the  charge  d’affaires  at  San  Salvador,  pointing  out  that  the 
gray  and  the  green  codes  were  too  old  to  be  secret  but  that  they  were  still 


492 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


being  used  for  confidential  messages,  suggested  that  the  department  mandate 
the  a-1  for  ordinary  confidential  messages  and  the  newer  b-1  for  highly 
confidential  ones.  The  department  seems  not  to  have  adopted  this  sensible 
suggestion.  Instead  it  continued  to  use  what  Herbert  Yardley,  then  its  quasi 
employee,  bitterly  and  accurately  called  sixteenth-century  codes. 

From  time  to  time  Salmon's  office  would  test  a new  system,  as  it  did  with 
the  Hitt  cipher  machine  that  Friedman  so  promptly  broke.  But  more  often 
Salmon  would  send  out — without  even  examining  the  system — a stock,  smug 
reply  to  each  of  the  dozens  of  proposals  that  poured  in  on  him  from  inventors : 
“The  Department  is  in  receipt  of  your  letter  of  the  25th  instant  making 
reference  to  the  creation  by  you  of  a new  code  system  and  inquiring  if  there 
is  a usage  for  such  a code.  I beg  to  inform  you  in  reply  that  the  codes  and 
ciphers  now  in  use  are  adequate  to  the  present  needs  of  this  Department.” 

Why  did  the  Department  of  State  not  introduce  improved  methods  of 
cryptography — perhaps  the  Vernam  machine  or  the  one-time  pad— at  least 
for  its  more  secret  messages?  Apparently  nothing  more  than  bureaucratic 
inertia,  probably  compounded  with  some  budgetary  tightness.  As  Yardley 
said:  “There  is  only  one  indecipherable  means  of  communication,  and  its 
adoption  would  require  the  Department  to  revolutionize  its  antiquated 
methods.”  His  conference  in  the  late  1920s  with  a high  department  official, 
who  had  summoned  him  to  discuss  the  problem  because  the  official  had 
heard  that  Mexico  was  reading  American  code  messages,  ended  on  that  note. 

Nothing  less  than  an  international  scandal  would  wake  up  the  government 
to  the  fact  that  the  very  basis  of  all  successful  diplomacy  is  safe  and  secret  lines 
of  communication.  But  my  whole  life  had  been  devoted  to  destruction.  I should 
like  to  leave  a monument  to  constructive  cryptography. 

As  I walked  through  the  wide  high  corridors  on  my  way  to  the  entrance,  I 
mused  how  proud  one  might  be  to  leave  to  the  United  States  Government  a 
method  of  communication  that  would  insure  the  secrecy  of  her  dispatches 
throughout  the  ages.  Aside  from  this,  of  course,  was  professional  pride.  Then 
too  it  would  be  fun  to  laugh  at  foreign  cryptographers  as  in  my  mind  I saw  them 
puzzling  over  our  secret  telegrams,  striving  in  vain  for  a solution. 

But  why  dream?  After  all,  weren’t  all  diplomatic  representatives  just  funny 
little  characters  on  a stage,  whispering,  whispering,  then  yelling  their  secrets  to 
the  heavens  as  they  put  them  on  the  cables ! 

American  cablegrams  certainly  yelled.  In  1929,  Charles  G.  Dawes, 
ambassador  to  the  Court  of  St.  James’s,  found  it  necessary  to  wire  the  State 
Department:  “Suggest  telegrams  contents  of  which  under  instruction  are  to 
be  conveyed  to  the  British  Government  should  not  be  coded  in  such  confiden- 
tial code.”  In  1931,  Stanley  K.  Hornbeck  of  the  Division  of  Far  Eastern 
Affairs  minuted  to  Secretary  of  State  Stimson:  “Mr.  Secretary:  1 have  the 
feeling  that  it  is  altogether  probable  that  the  Japanese  are  ‘breaking’  every 
confidential  telegram  that  goes  to  and  from  us,  in  Japan  and  in  territory  con- 
trolled by  Japan.  It  is  not  impossible,  but  less  likely,  that  the  Chinese  are

493 


doing  the  same  thing.  Whatever  may  be  the  facts,  I feel  that  we  should  have 
the  possibility  constantly  in  mind.”  A few  months  later,  as  if  in  confirmation, 
the  charge  d’affaires  at  Tokyo  reported  that  the  American  consul  general  at 
Seoul,  Korea,  then  a part  of  the  Japanese  Empire,  had  received  new  a-1  cipher 
tables  with  wax  seals  broken.  By  this  time,  the  insecurity  of  American  codes 
seemed  almost  to  be  taken  for  granted.  “I  could  not  help  wondering,”  Ambas- 
sador to  Japan  W.  Cameron  Forbes  cabled  Stimson  on  February  16,  1932, 
“whether  in  view  of  the  imperfection  of  our  codes,  this  [aforementioned 
dispatch]  might  not  be  read  off  by  the  Chinese  secret  service  people” — a 
reading  which,  he  thought,  “would  immediately  put  the  Chinese  against  the 
proposition.” 

This  disquieting  state  of  affairs  remained  pretty  much  in  effect  during  the 
thirties.  State  basically  continued  to  use  the  same  old  codes.  Ambassadors 
still  had  to  decode  especially  secret  messages  intended  for  them  alone.  For  at 
least  one,  Harry  F.  Guggenheim  in  Cuba,  the  excitement  of  knowing  that  the 
message  would  be  important  mitigated  the  onerousness  of  the  task.  Under  the 
prodding  of  President  Roosevelt,  who  had  learned  to  pay  attention  to  com- 
munications security  as  an  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Navy  in  World  War  I, 
State  produced  several  new  codes,  among  them  the  brown.  The  brown 
was  stolen  from  the  American  consulate  at  Zagreb  by  a gang  of  Ustachi 
bandits  as  a by-product  of  a safe-cracking  raid,  but  it  continued  to  be 
used  elsewhere  in  the  world.  In  addition,  c-1  and  d-1  codes  had  been  added, 
each — like  the  a-1  and  b-1 — with  its  own  tables  for  superencipherment.  These 
tables  served  for  irregular  periods  ranging  from  two  to  five  months.  They 
added  slightly  to  the  security  of  the  codes  but  greatly  to  their  cumbersome- 
ness: during  the  Munich  crisis,  half  the  vice  consuls  in  Berlin  had  to  work  in 
the  code  room. 

Late  in  the  1930s,  the  department  adapted  as  its  most  secret  method  of 
cryptography  the  system  invented  a century  and  a half  earlier  by  the  first 
Secretary  of  State,  Thomas  Jefferson.  This  was  the  strip  cipher,  the  m-138,  the 
flattened-out  Jefferson  wheel  cypher-Bazeries  cylinder,  first  constructed  in 
strip  form  by  Parker  Hitt  in  1914.  Each  m-138  set  had  100  strips.  In  encipher- 
ing, 30  at  a time  were  used,  with  the  ciphertext  being  read  off,  not  from 
one  generatrix,  but  from  two  in  groups  of  15  letters  each.  So  long  as  the  strips 
were  kept  secret  and  were  changed  often  enough,  the  strip  system  apparently 
secured  important  American  diplomatic  correspondence.  State  used  it,  for 
example,  to  encipher  a triple  priority  message  from  Roosevelt  to  Churchill 
just  after  the  Atlantic  Conference. 

President  Roosevelt,  however,  distrusted  State  Department  codes  on 
principle.  So  when  war  broke  out  in  Europe,  he  communicated  with  his 
ambassadors  in  London,  Paris,  and  Moscow  via  Navy  Department  crypto- 
systems for  “matters  of  utmost  secrecy.”  This  annoyed  the  State  Department, 
which  felt  that  diplomatic  matters  were  being  kept  from  it.  “But,”  William 
C.  Bullitt,  ambassador  to  France,  later  wrote,  “I  should  regret  to  have  the

impression  prevail  that  this  was  due  to  a desire  to  conceal  anything  from  the 
Secretary  of  State,  Mr.  Hull,  for  whom  I always  have  had  high  respect.  It  was 
due  to  lack  of  security  in  the  Department  of  State.  The  codes  of  the  depart- 
ment were  so  antiquated  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  President,  they  had  been 
broken  by  all  the  totalitarian  powers.”  Admiral  W.  H.  Standley,  ambassador 
to  Moscow,  said  that  “It  was  also  common  gossip  that  the  State  Department 
codes  were  insecure.”  The  American  embassy  in  Madrid  received  its  most 
secret  instructions  in  a British  code ! 

Both  Bullitt  and  Standley  also  mentioned  leaks  in  the  State  Department  as 
another  reason  for  using  Navy  codes.  Leaks  there  were — and  from  the  very 
heart  of  State’s  communications.  On  April  30,  1940,  Hans  Thomsen,  Ger- 
many’s charge  d’affaires  at  Washington,  cabled  home:  “A  reliable  and  tried 
confidential  agent  who  is  very  friendly  with  the  director  of  the  code  room  of 
the  State  Department  reports  as  follows  after  having  seen  the  relevant  telegra- 
phic reports.”  On  September  30,  Thomsen  relayed  to  Germany  intelligence 
that  the  same  reliable  informant  had  obtained  from  a cablegram  sent  to 
Roosevelt  by  the  American  ambassador  to  Britain,  Joseph  P.  Kennedy.  On 
December  29,  the  German  ambassador  to  Spain  wired  home  about  “a  code 
telegram  from  Cordell  Hull  to  the  United  States  ambassador  here  on  Decem- 
ber 18,  the  text  of  which  has  become  known  to  me.”  All  these  helped  Germany 
in  shaping  her  foreign  policy.  The  message  to  Madrid,  for  example,  showed 
that  the  Spanish  Foreign  Minister  was  lying  to  Germany  when  he  insisted 
that  Spain  would  not  receive  needed  grain  if  she  stayed  neutral. 

The  worst  of  the  leaks  took  place  in  London,  where  Tyler  Kent,  a bright, 
handsome,  but  twisted  young  man,  worked  in  the  code  room  of  the  American 
embassy.  Convinced  that  a vast  Jewish  conspiracy  was  pushing  the  United 
States  into  an  unwanted  war,  and  that  to  help  the  enemy  of  the  Jews  was  to 
help  his  own  country,  Kent  took  telegrams  from  the  embassy  and  passed 
them  to  a pro-Nazi  group.  By  various  channels  they  reached  Germany. 
The  German  ambassador  in  Italy  wired  home  a report  of  Roosevelt’s  reply  to 
Churchill’s  request  for  50  destroyers  only  seven  days  after  it  was  received  in 
London.  On  May  20,  however,  Scotland  Yard  plugged  the  leak.  It  arrested 
members  of  the  pro-Nazi  group  for  espionage  and,  with  State  Department 
approval,  searched  Kent’s  rooms. 

There  police  agents  found  copies  of  more  than  1,500  embassy  papers,  many 
of  them  telegrams,  as  well  as  two  newly  made  duplicate  keys  to  the  index 
bureau  and  the  code  room  of  the  embassy.  When  the  stunned  ambassador 
asked  him  why  he  would  betray  his  country  this  way,  Kent  explained  that 
giving  the  documents  to  Germany  would  help  keep  America  out  of  war.  He 
was  instantly  dismissed,  and  then,  having  lost  his  diplomatic  immunity,  was 
arrested,  tried,  and  convicted  by  the  British  for  violating  the  Official  Secrets 
Act  and  sentenced  to  seven  years  in  prison. 

But  the  damage  had  been  done.  “The  removal  of  so  large  a number  of 
documents  from  the  Embassy  premises,”  the  State  Department  later  declared.

“compromised  the  whole  confidential  communications  system  of  the  United 
States,  bringing  into  question  the  security  of  the  secret  ciphers.”  Kennedy  said : 
“Because  of  his  [Kent’s]  treachery,  all  diplomatic  communications  of  the 
American  diplomatic  service  were  blacked-out  at  a most  critical  moment  in 
history — during  the  days  of  Dunkirk  and  the  fall  of  France.  The  blackout, 
which  concerned  the  American  embassies  and  missions  throughout  the  world, 
lasted  from  two  to  six  weeks  until  scores  of  special  couriers  had  reached  the 
embassies  with  new  codes  from  Washington.” 

On  the  other  side  of  the  globe,  meanwhile,  poor  American  cryptography 
gave  aid  to  a potential  enemy  and  injured  the  cause  of  peace.  Within  the 
cable  section  of  Japan’s  Foreign  Ministry  was  hidden  a small  cryptanalytic 
group,  the  Ango  Kenkyu  Han  (“Code  Research  Section”).  About  five  of  its 
members  worked  on  English  and  American  codes.  Each  morning  a messenger 
from  the  Foreign  Ministry  (and  others  from  the  Army  and  Navy)  picked  up 
copies  of  foreign  diplomatic  telegrams  from  the  Communications  Ministry’s 
censorship  department.  Of  the  main  codes  then  in  use  by  the  American 
embassy — gray,  brown,  a-1,  b-1,  c-1,  d-1,  and  m-138 — the  Ango  Kenkyu 
Han  could  read  three  or  four  of  the  lower  grade.  Ambassador  Joseph  C. 
Grew  may  have  inadvertently  helped  them.  “One  of  the  high  officials  of  the 
Japanese  Government  wanted  to  send  a secret  message  to  our  Government 
which  they  did  not  want  the  Japanese  military  to  see  and  in  passing  this 
message  on  they  asked  me  to  please  put  it  in  our  most  secret  code.  I said  of 
course  I would  do  so.”  Even  so,  the  Japanese  failed  to  penetrate  the  m-138 
and  the  higher-grade  codes. 

The  nonsecrecy  of  the  State  Department  codes  inhibited  negotiations  with 
the  moderates  in  Japan.  Noted  Grew  in  his  diary  on  August  1,  1941 : “Prince 
Konoye  [the  Japanese  premier]  knows  that  I would  like  to  talk  with  him 
oftener,  just  as  the  President  does  with  Admiral  Nomura,  but  it  is  the  fear  of 
leakages  and  publicity  which  has  prevented  such  interviews.  It  was  indicated 
that  any  reports  which  our  Embassy  might  send  to  Washington  would  of 
course  become  known  to  the  Japanese  authorities,  although  our  informant 
said  that  he  understood  that  we  did  have  ‘one  confidential  code’  (highly 
significant,  but  I feel  perfectly  safe  in  the  use  of  the  one  confidential  code 
referred  to).” 

On  December  6,  1941,  President  Roosevelt  dispatched  his  personal  appeal 
for  peace  to  the  Emperor  of  Japan.  He  sent  it  to  the  State  Department  accom- 
panied by  a handwritten  note  on  White  House  stationery:  “Dear  Cordell 
Shoot  this  to  Grew — I think  can  go  in  gray  code — saves  time — I don’t  mind 
if  it  gets  picked  up  FDR.”  His  message  was  delivered  to  the  embassy  in 
Tokyo  ten  hours  after  it  had  been  received  in  the  Communications  Ministry  in 
Tokyo,  and  it  is  interesting  that  Grew,  though  he  did  not  know  of  Roosevelt's 
note,  long  thought  that  the  use  of  the  gray  code  had  not  saved  but  cost  time 
because  Japanese  militarists  had  picked  up  the  message,  solved  it,  and 
deliberately  detained  it  to  frustrate  any  peace  efforts.  However,  this  was  not

so;  the  delay  resulted  from  an  embargo  placed  by  the  military  on  all  incoming 
diplomatic  messages. 

Among  the  interested  readers  of  coded  American  diplomatic  messages  was 
the  Reich  Foreign  Minister.  Pers  z served  him  well.  As  early  as  1925,  it  had

of  the  cucuc  and  cuccu  types;  to  encipher  them,  the  code  clerk  split  them 
into  a single  consonant  and  two  cu  or  uc  groups,  then  replaced  these  segments 
with  substitutes  from  the  appropriate  tables.  This  superencipherment  left  the

cucuc  and  cuccu  configuration  of  the  codegroup  unchanged,  and  this 
regularity  enabled  the  Pers  z mathematicians  to  break  first  into  this  original 
system  and,  in  1940,  into  a modification  of  it.  Ironically,  changes  of  super- 
encipherment within  a message,  intended  to  provide  greater  security,  furnished 
the  German  cryptanalysts  with  isomorphic  repetitions  that  helped  them 
reconstitute  the  superencipherment  substitution.  With  the  superencipherment 
stripped  off,  the  linguistic  group  solved  a big  72,000-group  code  with  not  too 
much  trouble.  Dr.  Hans-Kurt  Muller  was  instrumental  in  this;  he  had  an

Pers  z solution  of  an  encoded  message  of  Robert  Murphy  to  the  State  Department

They  were  greatly  helped  in  their  work  by  their  knowledge  of  the  activities 
of  diplomat  Robert  Murphy,  who  in  1941  and  1942  was  in  North  Africa, 
handling  delicate  negotiations  with  the  Vichy  French  and  paving  the  way 
for  the  Allied  invasion  of  North  Africa.  Murphy  insisted  upon  using  the  State 
Department  codes  to  preserve  his  autonomy,  even  though  American  officers  in 
Eisenhower’s  command  pointed  out  their  insecurity.  He  was  certain  that  the 
Germans  had  not  broken  his  codes.  In  fact,  however,  the  Pers  z cryptanalysts 
had  broken  them  enough  to  recognize  the  groups  meaning  For  Murphy  or 
From  Murphy  that  recurred  at  the  head  of  so  many  telegrams.  “We  knew 
what  he  was  interested  in,  and  this  gave  us  clues,”  Miss  Friedrichs  said.  These 


498 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


rapidly  helped  complete  the  solution  of  the  big  code.  Murphy’s  communica- 
tions so  facilitated  her  work,  she  said,  that  when  she  saw  him  drive  by  one 
day  after  the  war  while  she  was  interned  in  Marburg,  “I  wanted  to  stop  him 
and  shake  his  hand.” 

Thus,  as  early  as  August  12,  1941,  the  state  secretary  of  the  Foreign  Olfice 
could  hand  to  von  Ribbentrop  fully  solved  copies  of  Murphy’s  telegrams  of 
July  21  and  August  2.  The  first  reported  that  Murphy  had  transmitted  Roose- 
velt’s views  on  French  North  Africa  to  General  Maxime  Weygand,  command- 
ing there.  The  second  transmitted  a Weygand  aide’s  request  for  an  American 
promise  of  military  assistance.  The  Nazis  knew  Weygand  was  no  friend  of 
theirs,  but  it  was  not  until  they  had  what  a Vichy  source  called  “documentary 
proof”  of  his  dealings  with  the  United  States  that  they  forced  Vichy  to  dismiss 
him.  Thus  the  solution  of  an  American  diplomatic  code  cost  the  United  States 
much  valuable  time  and  work  that  it  was  forced  to  recommence  with  the  new 
leaders  of  French  North  Africa,  and  it  may  ultimately  have  prolonged  the 
war  and  cost  the  lives  of  American  soldiers  who  fought  in  that  theater. 

A year  later,  the  still-continuing  German  reading  of  coded  American 
dispatches  endangered  the  work  of  Allen  W.  Dulles,  nominally  a diplomat 
attached  to  the  Bern  legation  but  actually  chief  American  spymaster  in 
Europe.  Dulles,  who  had  recently  begun  to  plot  with  anti-Nazis  in  Germany 
to  overthrow  Hitler,  was  unusually  sensitive  to  the  possibility  of  broken  codes. 
In  his  cables,  he  referred  to  agents  by  codenames,  which  he  changed  fre- 
quently. He  called  the  conspirators  planning  to  assassinate  Hitler  breakers. 
In  February  of  1943,  one  of  them,  Hans  Bernd  Gisevius,  an  official  in  the 
German  consulate  at  Zurich,  told  Dulles  that  Germany  had  broken  one  of  the 
American  codes.  Producing  a little  black  notebook,  he  recited  the  gist  of 
numerous  telegrams  from  Bern  to  Washington.  “Fortunately,”  Dulles  wrote, 
“it  was  not  my  own  code  and  I had  not  used  it  for  sending  any  operational 
messages,  but  as  I was  then  short  of  code  clerks  I occasionally  had  fallen  back 
on  this  particular  code  to  send  general  political  reports.” 

One  of  the  messages  that  Gisevius  read  off  had  contained  a fairly  accurate 
portrait  of  the  anti-German  group  in  Italy.  Even  early  in  1943,  this  was 
solidifying  around  Marshal  Pietro  Badoglio,  who  in  July  deposed  Mussolini 
and  formed  a new  anti-Fascist  government,  and  around  the  prolific  diarist 
Count  Galeazzo  Ciano,  Mussolini’s  son-in-law  and  Foreign  Minister.  Gisevius 
told  Dulles  that  the  American  telegram  had  been  laid  on  Hitler’s  desk  and 
then  sent  by  the  Fiihrer  to  Mussolini  with  his  compliments.  A few  days  later 
Ciano  was  dismissed  as  Foreign  Minister.  “I  never  was  able  to  discover,” 
Dulles  wrote,  “whether  this  was  coincidence  or  whether  this  cable  was  the 
cause.” 

After  Gisevius'  disclosure,  Dulles,  displaying  great  delicacy  in  intelligence 
operation,  used  the  code  “only  for  messages  which  we  were  quite  willing  or 
even  anxious  to  have  the  Germans  read,  and  over  the  months  we  discarded  it 
entirely.  To  have  stopped  using  it  immediately  would  have  told  the  Germans 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  Neutrals  and  Allies 


499 


that  we  knew  they  had  broken  it.”  Gisevius  had  feared  that  the  intelligence 
the  Germans  might  have  obtained  from  the  cryptanalysis  would  spoil  the  anti- 
Hitler  program.  But  Dulles  convinced  him  that  he  took  every  precaution  in 
handling  this  information.  The  incident  actually  strengthened  their  collabora- 
tion, which  culminated  in  the  bomb  plot  of  July  20,  1944,  in  which  Hitler 
narrowly  escaped  with  his  life. 

Dulles  thought  that,  after  abandoning  use  of  the  broken  code,  “the  Ger- 
mans never  succeeded  in  deciphering  any  of  the  messages  I sent,  and  I had  the 
satisfaction  of  knowing  that  no  one  who  worked  with  me  was  ever  jeopardized 
through  deciphered  telegrams.  It  was  worrisome  business,  however,  and  I 
never  put  a cipher  message  on  the  air  which  gave  specific  facts  about  the 
underground  without  a feeling  of  apprehension.”  His  apprehensions  were 
justified.  For  although  the  Germans  may  not  have  solved  his  cryptograms,  the 
Hungarian  Army  unit  under  Major  Bibo  had.  It  fed  its  information  to  the 
R.S.H.A.  through  Wilhelm  Hottl,  but  no  concrete  anticonspirator  results 
seem  to  have  been  achieved,  perhaps  because  of  Dulles’  care  in  always  using 
codenames. 

During  these  midwar  years,  President  Roosevelt,  still  distrusting  State 
Department  codes,  continued  to  rely  on  naval  cryptosystems  for  his  most 
secret  messages.  He  exchanged  hundreds  with  Churchill,  who,  signing  himself 
“Former  Naval  Person”  in  recollection  of  his  having  been  First  Lord  of  the 
Admiralty  (and  no  doubt  with  Roosevelt’s  former  assistant  secretaryship  of 
the  Navy  well  in  mind),  said  that  “I  sent  my  cables  to  the  American  Embassy 
in  London,  which  was  in  direct  touch  with  the  President  at  the  White  House 
through  special  coding  machines.”  These  machines  were  naval ; they  were  very 
probably  one-time  tape  devices  manufactured  by  the  Teletype  Corporation. 

As  the  war  progressed,  the  State  Department  gradually  took  the  old 
solved  codes  out  of  service  and  replaced  them  with  new  cryptosystems.  It 
thus  choked  off  the  German  sources  of  information.  To  get  them  flowing 
again,  Pers  z launched,  in  1944,  a major  effort  to  break  the  m-138.  The  work 
was  primarily  mathematical,  with  Hans  Rohrbach,  a 37-year-old  doctor  of 
mathematics,  playing  a leading  role.  Rohrbach  and  Muller  first  divided  the 
messages  into  “families”  enciphered  with  the  same  strip  arrangement,  using 
repetitions  as  family  resemblances.  This  meant  that,  in  a given  family,  the 
first  strip  was  always  the  same,  the  second  was  always  the  same,  and  so  on. 
Stereotyped  beginnings  gave  the  cryptanalysts  many  plaintext  assumptions — 
Muller  was  as  adept  at  spotting  words  here  as  with  the  code.  On  each 
strip,  the  plaintext  stood  an  unknown  distance  from  the  ciphertext.  By  com- 
paring many  such  equivalents,  both  within  a single  strip  and  with  the  help  of 
information  from  neighboring  strips,  the  cryptanalysts  mapped  the  letters  on 
the  strips  to  reproduce  the  original  alphabet.  Collaboration  among  the  half- 
dozen  cryptanalysts  was  extremely  close.  Each  man  looked  after  his  own 
families,  but  they  conferred  frequently  so  that  each  could  try  on  his  own 
sequence  of  strips  the  possibilities  found  by  others.  Helping  them  in  their  work

was  a mechanism  that  moved  the  strips  up  and  down  to  align  them  quickly. 
Eventually  Pers  z recovered  all  the  m-138  strips  and  read  nearly  all  the 
messages.  But  by  then  they  had  lost  much  of  their  intelligence  value,  and 
any  hopes  that  the  solution  would  help  in  the  future  vanished  when  the 
strips  were  changed. 

The  m-138  was,  by  then,  no  longer  the  topmost  American  diplomatic 
cryptosystem.  The  armed  services  had  given  the  State  Department  cipher 
machines,  including  Vernam-system  machines  called  sigtot,  which  the 
diplomats  used  for  their  most  secret  messages,  though  they  still  used  codes  for 
economy.  American  Army  and  Navy  cryptanalysts  taught  State  some  of  the 
practical  lessons  in  cryptology  that  they  had  learned  through  their  solutions. 
On  June  3,  1944,  Captain  Lee  W.  Parke,  the  Navy  cryptanalyst  who  had  been 
senior  watch  officer  in  op-20-gy  at  the  time  of  Pearl  Harbor,  was  detailed  to 
the  State  Department,  and  on  November  1 he  became  chief  of  the  new  Divi- 
sion of  Cryptography.  Under  the  direction  of  an  expert  cryptologist,  the 
State  Department  communications  at  last  took  on  a strength  commensurate 
with  that  of  the  nation  itself.  The  days  of  easy-to-break  codes  were  ended. 
The  era  of  American  diplomatic  cryptosecurity  had  begun. 

Among  the  characteristic  features  of  World  War  II  was  the  extensive  use 
of  codenames  to  designate  important  operations  or  secret  projects.  Codenames 
had  been  used  before — the  words  “tank”  and  “blimp”  themselves  derive  from 
World  War  I codenames — but  never  so  frequently.  They  aimed  both  at 
security  and  brevity:  obviously  it  was  easier  to  say  “Operation  torch”  than 
“the  Anglo-American  invasion  of  North  Africa,”  and  solvers  of  any  messages 
would  still  have  to  determine  the  meaning  of  the  codenames. 

Selection  and  assignment  of  the  codenames  was,  in  the  United  States,  a 
duty  of  the  Current  Section  of  the  Army’s  Operations  Division.  Men  of  the 
unit  culled  the  unabridged  dictionaries  for  suitable  words — chiefly  common 
nouns  and  adjectives  that  did  not  imply  operations  or  localities.  They  avoided, 
as  confusing,  personal  and  ships’  names  and  geographical  terms.  Of  the 
dictionaries’  400,000  words,  they  compiled  about  10,000  in  scrambled  order 
in  a classified  book.  They  cross-checked  these  to  eliminate  any  conflicts  with 
British  codenames.  Then  they  assigned  blocks  of  codenames  to  theater 
commanders. 

In  theory  the  codenames  bore  no  relation,  either  by  denotation  or  connota- 
tion, to  what  they  stood  for.  In  the  majority  of  cases  this  held  in  practice. 
flintlock  meant  the  Allied  attack  on  the  Marshall  Islands  in  1944; 
avalanche,  the  amphibious  attack  on  Salerno;  anvil,  later  dragoon,  the 
Anglo-American  landings  in  the  soft  underbelly  of  France.  Even  relatively 
small  operations  were  dubbed : the  relief  of  Australians  trapped  in  Tobruk 
was  supercharge,  the  occupation  of  the  Canary  Islands  was  pilgrim.  Some 
codenames  were  written  in  blood : omaha,  utah,  gold,  sword,  and  juno, 
for  the  Normandy  beaches  of  D-Day.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Five  of  the  codenames  assigned  for  that  cross-channel  operation — them- 
selves highly  secret,  as  were  their  referents — inexplicably  appeared  in  the 
crossword  puzzles  of  the  London  Daily  Telegraph  in  the  month  before  June  6. 
Alarmed  counterintelligence  officials,  fearing  a Purloined-Letter  type  of 
concealment  in  what  might  be  a warning  to  Germany,  investigated — and 
found  that  the  cause  was  merely  an  incredible  coincidence. 

For  minor  operations  the  Germans  usually  selected  Decknamen  (“cover- 
names”)  that  did  not  suggest  the  operation:  merkur  (“Mercury”)  for  the 
seizure  of  Crete  and  fischreiher  (“Heron”)  for  Stalingrad.  But  in  major 
operations  they  violated  this  precept.  The  Decknamen  seelowe  (“Sea  Lion”) 
for  the  invasion  of  England  and  herbstreise  (“Autumn  Pleasure  Voyage”) 
for  the  simultaneous  feint  of  seaborne  troops  from  Norwegian  ports  to 
northern  England  hardly  obscured  the  secrecy  of  the  operations  they  named. 
Least  subtle  of  all  was  barbarossa  for  the  invasion  of  Russia.  To  be  sure, 
“Barbarossa”  was  the  nickname  of  the  great  medieval  German  king,  Frederick 
I,  but  not  only  does  it  mean  “Red  Beard”  in  Italian,  it  also  calls  to  mind  one 
of  Frederick’s  greatest  achievements  in  extending  German  authority  over 
Slavs  to  the  east. 

The  Allies  never  were  as  obvious  as  that,  but  their  selections  were  some- 
times constrained  by  principles  that  that  master  of  English,  Winston  Churchill, 
laid  down  in  a memorandum  of  August  8,  1943: 

I have  crossed  out  on  the  attached  paper  many  unsuitable  names.  Operations 
in  which  large  numbers  of  men  may  lose  their  lives  ought  not  to  be  described  by 
code-words  which  imply  a boastful  and  overconfident  sentiment,  such  as  “Trium- 
phant,” or,  conversely,  which  are  calculated  to  invest  the  plan  with  an  air  of 
despondency,  such  as  “Woebetide,”  “Massacre,”  “Jumble,”  “Trouble,” 
“Fidget,”  “Flimsy,”  “Pathetic,”  and  “Jaundice.”  They  ought  not  to  be  names 
of  a frivolous  character,  such  as  “Bunnyhug,”  “Billingsgate,”  “Aperitif,”  and 
“Ballyhoo.”  They  should  not  be  ordinary  words  often  used  in  other  connections, 
such  as  “Flood,”  “Smooth,”  “Sudden,”  “Supreme,”  “Fullforce,”  and  “Full- 
speed.”  Names  of  living  people — Ministers  or  Commanders — should  be  avoided, 
e.g.,  “Bracken.” 

2.  After  all,  the  world  is  wide,  and  intelligent  thought  will  readily  supply  an 
unlimited  number  of  well-sounding  names  which  do  not  suggest  the  character 
of  the  operation  or  disparage  it  in  any  way  and  do  not  enable  some  widow  or 
mother  to  say  that  her  son  was  killed  in  an  operation  called  “Bunnyhug”  or 
“Ballyhoo.” 

3.  Proper  names  are  good  in  this  field.  The  heroes  of  antiquity,  figures  from 
Greek  and  Roman  mythology,  the  constellations  and  stars,  famous  racehorses, 
names  of  British  and  American  war  heroes,  could  be  used,  provided  they  fall 
within  the  rules  above.  There  are  no  doubt  many  other  themes  that  could  be 
suggested. 

4.  Care  should  be  taken  in  all  this  process.  An  efficient  and  a successful 
administration  manifests  itself  equally  in  small  as  in  great  matters. 

Churchill  himself  had  always  manifested  an  interest  in  these  matters, 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  Neutrals  and  Allies 


503 


particularly  where  they  involved  nuances  of  meaning.  “The  name  ‘Round-up’ 
has  been  given  to  the  1943  operation  [proposed  invasion  of  Europe],”  he 
cabled  to  Roosevelt  on  July  6,  1942.  “I  do  not  much  like  this  name,  as  it  might 
be  thought  overconfident  or  overgloomy,  but  it  has  come  into  considerable 
use.  Please  let  me  know  whether  you  have  any  wishes  about  this.”  He  com- 
plained to  the  chiefs  of  staff  that  it  was  “boastful,  ill-chosen,”  and  hoped  that 
“it  does  not  bring  us  bad  luck.”  The  codeword  died  a natural  death  (for  a 
codeword)  when  the  plan  it  designated  was  replaced  by  Operation  gymnast, 
whose  possible  variations  were  indicated  by  appropriate  modifications  of  the 
codeword.  Churchill  had  strongly  urged  this  operation,  which  was  the  invasion 
of  North  Africa,  and  after  the  Allies  decided  to  go  ahead  with  it,  he  “hastened 
to  rechristen  my  favourite.  ‘Gymnast,’  ‘Super-Gymnast’  and  ‘Semi-Gymnast’ 
vanished  from  our  code-words.  On  July  24  in  an  instruction  from  me  to  the 
Chiefs  of  Staff  ‘Torch’  became  the  new  and  master  term.” 

The  Americans  demonstrated  a like  sensitivity  when  they  codenamed  the 
crowning  operations  of  the  Pacific  War,  the  invasion  of  Japan,  coronet  and 
Olympic.  But  it  remained  for  Churchillian  eloquence  to  find  the  great  code- 
name  of  the  war  for  the  greatest  operation  of  the  war.  The  name  evoked  a sense 
of  majesty  and  patriarchal  vengeance  and  irresistible  power  for  the  supreme 
Allied  effort  to  enter  the  continent  of  Europe  and  crush  forever  the  wicked 
Nazi  conspiracy.  The  master  wordsmith  himself  consecrated  that  crusade 
with  the  codename  Operation  overlord. 

Before  that  vast  offensive  could  be  mounted,  the  Allies  had  to  win  the 
Battle  of  the  Atlantic.  In  this,  communications  intelligence  played  a role  of 
high  importance.  Indeed,  in  some  respects  the  Battle  of  the  Atlantic  might  be 
viewed  as  a duel  between  the  Axis  and  the  Allied  cryptanalytic  organizations. 
And  while  Donitz’  B-Dienst  had  its  successes,  the  Allied  communications- 
intelligence  agencies  enjoyed  the  advantage  of  access  to  the  extremely  heavy 
traffic  of  the  U-boat  fleet. 

In  part,  this  stemmed  from  Donitz’  insistence  on  maintaining  tactical 
control  of  his  submarines  so  as  to  concentrate  them  in  wolf  packs  on  the 
richest  prizes.  He  was  aware  of  the  danger  in  all  the  talk,  but,  he  contended, 
“The  signals  from  the  U-boats  contained  the  information  upon  which  was 
based  the  planning  and  control  of  those  combined  attacks  which  alone  held 
the  promise  of  really  great  success  against  the  concentrated  shipping  of  any 
enemy  convoy.”  His  encouragement  of  communication  led  to  an  almost 
complete  relaxation  of  radio  discipline.  U-boats  went  on  the  air  to  report  a 
toothache  on  board  or  to  congratulate  a friend  at  headquarters  on  a birthday. 
U-boat  command  became  “the  most  gabby  military  organization  in  all  the 
history  of  war.” 

Thanks  to  Commander  Laurance  F.  Safford,  head  of  op-20-g  and  father 
of  the  Navy’s  communications-intelligence  organization,  the  United  States 
had,  upon  its  entrance  into  the  war,  an  Atlantic  arc  of  high-frequency 


504 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


direction-finders  to  exploit  the  U-boat  garrulity.  Stations  reported  their 
bearings  to  their  net  control  center  in  Maryland,  whence  they  were  flashed 
to  the  naval  communications-intelligence  organization  at  3801  Nebraska 
Avenue,  North  West,  in  Washington.  Commander  Knight  McMahon  and  his 
staff  combined  them  into  fixes  and  flashed  these  to  the  Atlantic  Section  of  the 
Navy  Commander  in  Chief’s  Combat  Intelligence  Division.  From  here  they 
sped  to  antisubmarine  forces. 

How  fast  this  net — called  “huffduff”  from  the  HF/DF  abbreviation  of 
“high-frequency  direction-finding” — could  work  was  shown  by  the  episode  of 
June  30,  1942.  That  morning,  U-158  went  on  the  air  to  report  to  Donitz  that 
he  had  nothing  to  report.  Huffduff  stations  at  Bermuda,  Hartland  Point, 
Kingston,  and  Georgetown  heard  him.  McMahon  plotted  his  position  as 
latitude  33  degrees  north,  longitude  67  degrees  30  minutes  west.  This  informa- 
tion raced  down  through  channels  until  it  reached  Lieutenant  Richard  E. 
Schreder,  U.S.N.,  flying  an  antisubmarine  patrol  out  of  Bermuda.  Ten  miles 
from  the  spotted  location  he  found  U-158  loafing  on  the  surface,  its  crew  sun- 
bathing. One  of  Schreder’s  depth  charges  landed  on  the  submarine’s  super- 
structure just  as  it  was  trying  to  dive.  It  went  down  all  right,  but  it  never 
came  up. 

In  another  case,  huffduff  hounded  a U-boat  to  death.  The  net  first  heard 
a transmission  of  U-66  on  April  19, 1944,  and  followed  her  successive  messages 
in  her  attempts  to  rendezvous  with  a supply  submarine.  Alhed  ships,  told 
where  to  go  by  huffduff,  repeatedly  frustrated  these  efforts,  and  on  May  5 her 
commander  wirelessed  home:  “Refueling  impossible  under  constant  stalking. 
Mid-Atlantic  worse  than  Bay  of  Biscay.”  Her  “spurt”  transmission — made 
by  tape-recording  the  message  and  then  radioing  the  tape  at  high  speed — 
lasted  less  than  15  seconds,  but  no  fewer  than  26  huffduff  stations  got  bear- 
ings on  it,  probably  as  a result  of  improved  equipment  that  scanned  the 
horizon  20  times  a second  and  zeroed  in  accurately  and  semiautomatically  on 
any  emission.  Three  hours  later,  an  American  plane  spotted  the  U-boat;  an 
hour  after  that  an  American  ship  began  to  attack  it,  and  within  25  minutes 
the  submarine  had  gone  down. 

In  addition  to  huffduff,  an  intercept  network  eavesdropped  on  the  text  of 
the  German  messages.  The  Navy  monitors  could  often  tell  one  U-boat  from 
another  by  the  sending  characteristics  of  their  radio  operators,  and  some- 
times could  ascertain  the  number  of  U-boats  in  a wolf  pack.  They  grew  so 
familiar  with  the  submarine  signals  that  they  sometimes  knew  simply  from 
external  characteristics  that  a given  message  was  a convoy  contact  report  or  a 
signal  that  attack  had  begun. 

Help  was  obtained  from  the  most  exciting  code  theft  of  World  War  II. 
It  took  place  on  the  high  seas  with  lightninglike  speed  under  conditions  of 
great  peril. 

Early  in  1944,  Captain  Daniel  V.  Gallery,  U.S.N.,  commanding  the  anti- 
submarine Task  Group  22.3,  conceived  a daring  plan  for  boarding  a U-boat

Messages  in  plaintext  from  Radio  Logbook  No.  6 of  the  captured  U-505 


and  capturing  it  if,  as  sometimes  happened,  it  surfaced  after  depth-charge 
damage  to  allow  its  crew  to  escape.  Even  though  the  plan  as  a whole  might 
fail,  he  might  pirate  the  submarine’s  cryptographic  equipment,  which  alone 
would  make  such  a venture  worthwhile.  So  he  trained  a team  of  volunteers  in 
dismantling  booby  traps,  closing  sea  cocks,  and  handling  a U-boat.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


On  May  31,  1944,  he  began  tracking  U-505,  which  huffduff  had  dis- 
covered was  apparently  heading  for  its  home  port  at  Brest.  At  1 1 a.m.  Sunday, 
June  4,  a clear  day  with  a light  breeze,  he  made  sound  contact  with  the  U-boat 
about  150  miles  west  of  Cape  Blanco,  French  West  Africa.  Its  captain  was  at 
lunch  when  a salvo  of  depth  charges  slammed  the  peacefully  gliding  vessel, 
holing  the  outer  hull  and  convincing  him  that  his  ship  was  mortally  stricken. 
He  blew  his  tanks  and  surfaced,  and  as  his  crew  boiled  out  of  hatches  and  the 
conning  tower  and  leaped  into  the  sea,  U.S.S.  Pillsbury  was  lowering  a whale- 
boat carrying  the  boarding  party. 

A few  moments  later,  it  reached  the  abandoned  sub,  rocking  gently  in  the 
long  Atlantic  swells.  Lieutenant  (j.g.)  Albert  L.  David,  leading  the  boarding 
party,  and  petty  officers  Arthur  K.  Knispel  and  Stanley  E.  Wdowiak  slipped 
through  the  hatch,  raced  forward  to  the  radio  room,  smashed  open  a couple 
of  lockers,  and  grabbed  the  cryptographic  equipment — the  current  codebook 
with  superencipherments,  the  cipher  machine  and  its  list  of  keys,  and  hundreds 
of  messages  with  parallel  plaintexts  and  ciphertexts.  The  Germans  had  appar- 
ently never  considered  the  possibility  of  a boarding  and  so  had  not  bothered 
to  jettison  the  material.  The  three  Americans  hastily  passed  the  items  up  on 
deck  so  that  the  team  would  have  something  to  show  for  its  efforts  even  if  it 
lost  the  sub. 

But  within  fifteen  minutes,  the  team  had  disconnected  demolition  charges 
and  shut  off  an  eight-inch  stream  of  water,  and  U-505  had  become  the  first 
enemy  warship  captured  by  a U.S.  Navy  boarding  party  since  the  War  of 
1812.  Gallery  put  a line  on  her  and  towed  her  back  to  the  United  States, 
where  she  eventually  wound  up  as  a permanent  display  outside  Chicago’s 
Museum  of  Science  and  Industry.  David  received  a Congressional  Medal  of 
Honor  for  his  heroism;  his  helpers  were  awarded  Navy  Crosses.  The  crypto- 
graphic material  went  to  Nebraska  Avenue.  The  crews  of  Task  Group  22.3 
maintained  a discreet  silence  about  their  feat,  and  U-boat  command,  thinking 
that  U-505  had  been  sunk,  since  no  contact  had  been  made  after  June  3,  never 
suspected  the  truth  and  did  not  change  its  ciphers.  Writer  Ladislas  Farago 
called  the  seizure  “the  climactic  single  episode  of  the  American  antisubmarine 
effort  in  the  Atlantic.” 

The  Allies  now  read  U-boat  operational  traffic.  For  they  had,  more  than 
a year  before  the  theft,  succeeded  in  solving  the  difficult  U-boat  systems  and — 
in  one  of  the  finest  cryptanalytic  achievements  of  the  war — managed  to  read 
the  intercepts  on  a current  basis.  For  this,  the  cryptanalysts  needed  the  help 
of  a mass  of  machinery  that  filled  two  buildings. 

What  all  this  did  to  the  submarines  was  graphically  described  by  the 
German  naval  officer  Harald  Busch:  “In  the  latter  half  of  1944  no  U-boat 
commander  would  incur  the  ordeal  of  refueling  if  he  could  possibly  avoid  it. 

. . . on  a suspiciously  large  number  of  occasions,  enemy  aircraft  had  made 
their  appearance  at  the  very  moment  when  the  pipeline  was  stretched  between 
the  two  boats  and  neither  was  able  to  dive,  with  the  result  that  many  U-boats 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  Neutrals  and  Allies 


507 


had  been  destroyed  in  the  act  of  refueling.  . . . Evidently  U-boat  commanders 
were  right  in  their  suspicions : the  enemy  could  and  did  decipher  the  signals 
transmitted  by  Admiral  Donitz’  headquarters  in  Berlin.” 

In  the  eleven  months  remaining  before  the  end  of  the  European  war,  the 
Allies,  greatly  aided  by  the  information  that  told  them  where  to  send  their 
now  powerful  air  and  naval  forces,  sank  nearly  300  U-boats— almost  one 
a day — and  greatly  reduced  their  shipping  losses.  “Battles  might  be  won  or 
lost,”  Churchill  wrote,  “enterprises  might  succeed  or  miscarry,  territories 
might  be  gained  or  quitted,  but  dominating  all  our  power  to  carry  on 
the  war,  or  even  keep  ourselves  alive,  lay  our  mastery  of  the  ocean  routes 
and  the  free  approach  and  entry  to  our  ports.”  These  the  Allies  mastered. 
“Reduced  to  the  simplest  terms,”  wrote  Farago  in  his  study  of  the  Battle  of 
the  Atlantic,  “the  Allies  won  the  U-boat  war  and  Germany  lost  it  because 
Donitz  talked  too  much.” 

Final  victory  over  the  Nazi  evil  could  come  only  by  driving  a military  stake 
through  its  heart,  and  in  this  mission  communications  intelligence  played  an 
important  role.  The  march  actually  began  in  North  Africa  in  1942  under  the 
pressure  for  a “Second  Front  Now.”  Communications-intelligence  units  were 
there — though  not  exactly  in  the  role  assigned  them.  Radio-intelligence  com- 
panies of  the  American  Army  charged  ashore  as  assault  troops ! They  soon 
resumed  their  proper  duties,  however,  and,  equipped  with  intercept  receivers 
and  direction-finders,  began  to  eavesdrop  on  the  Axis  messages.  During  the 
Tunisia  campaign,  the  128th,  117th,  122nd,  123rd,  and  849th  Signal  Com- 
panies (Radio  Intelligence)  tracked  the  Germans  all  over  North  Africa  and, 
by  monitoring  American  communications,  plugged  leaks  in  Allied  radio 
security.  The  128th  first  discovered  that  the  Germans  were  withdrawing  from 
the  Kasserine  Pass,  which  they  had  taken  a few  days  earlier  in  America’s  first 
blooding  in  Europe.  Later  the  128th  gave  advance  warning  of  several  enemy 
attacks.  In  Italy,  the  VI  Corps  intelligence  officer  said  that  his  radio  intelligence 
platoon  had  done  “outstanding”  work  during  the  march  on  Rome  and  had 
supplied  information  second  in  value  only  to  battle  reconnaissance.  Thus, 
even  though  the  manning  and  equipping  of  radio  intelligence  companies  did 
not  get  under  way  until  relatively  late  in  the  war,  officers  in  the  field  soon 
declared  their  product  to  be  “of  material  value  ...  at  times  vital”  and  praised 
the  units  as  among  the  “most  constantly  profitable  sources”  of  intelligence  on 
German  plans  and  movements. 

Strategic  communications  intelligence  about  German  intentions  in  the 
European  war  mainly  came,  however,  from  Japanese  sources.  This  should  not 
be  surprising.  The  Wehrmacht  had  the  advantage  of  interior  communications 
throughout  occupied  Europe  and  so  could  use  wire  networks,  which  offer  very 
little  opportunity  for  interception.  But  the  Japanese  diplomats  in  Berlin, 
Rome,  Madrid,  Lisbon,  Sofia,  Budapest,  and  Moscow  had  no  way  of  getting 
messages  back  to  Tokyo  but  by  radio.  These  the  Allies  intercepted. 

The  messages  of  the  Japanese  military  attaches,  whose  code  the  United 


508 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


States  had  broken,  yielded  quantities  of  information.  This  source  was  lost  to 
the  Allies  in  1943  in  an  ironic  development  that  demonstrates  the  superiority 
of  cryptanalysis  over  theft  as  a secret  source  of  information.  The  Office  of 
Strategic  Services,  America’s  new  spy  outfit,  in  a laudable  attempt  at  espion- 
age, penetrated  the  offices  of  the  Japanese  embassy  in  Portugal.  They  did  not 
disclose  their  plans  to  the  Army,  whose  Signal  Security  Agency  (formerly  the 
Signal  Intelligence  Service)  had  broken  the  code ; nor  did  the  Army  warn  the 
O.S.S.  against  doing  anything  that  would  jeopardize  its  cryptanalyses.  The 
upshot  was  that  the  Japanese  discovered  traces  of  the  search,  decided  that 
their  military  attache  code  might  have  been  compromised,  and  changed  it. 
The  Allies,  who  had  been  comfortably  reading  the  messages  without  benefit 
of  espionage,  still  had  not  broken  into  the  new  code  by  the  fall  of  1944.  Thus 
the  attempt  to  gain  information  by  cloak-and-dagger  methods  deprived  the 
United  States  of  information  that  it  had  been  obtaining  by  the  traceless  means 
of  communications  intelligence. 

Bulky  cipher  machines  such  as  the  Japanese  diplomats  used  could  not 
be  shipped  or  smuggled  into  blockaded  Europe  very  easily,  and  so  purple  re- 
mained in  service  throughout  the  war.  Quite  probably  the  Japanese  considered 
the  system  secure.  But  even  before  Pearl  Harbor  American  cryptanalysts  were 
reading  Japanese  purple  messages  from  Berlin,  and  they  preyed  upon  them 
even  more  avidly  after  the  United  States  entered  the  war.  Thus  William  F. 
Friedman’s  solution  of  purple  reverberated  throughout  the  war,  leading  to 
major  effects  and  making  it  one  of  the  world’s  great  cryptanalyses  not  only  in 
technique  but  in  importance  as  well. 

The  Germans  granted  the  Japanese  ambassador,  Baron  Hiroshi  Oshima, 
the  intimacies  of  an  ally,  and,  as  a former  military  attache,  he  took  consider- 
able interest  in  the  military  sphere.  Toward  the  end  of  October,  1943,  when  it 
became  evident  that  the  Allies  would  invade  Europe  and  the  Wehrmacht  had 
begun  to  stiffen  its  defenses,  Oshima  toured  the  Westwall  and  the  Siegfried 
Fine.  He  reported  on  these  preparations  in  great  detail  in  a long  radiogram  of 
between  1,000  and  2,000  words. 

As  a powerful  German  station  pumped  it  into  the  ether  for  the  5,000-mile 
leap  to  Tokyo,  a new  American  intercept  post  at  Asmara,  in  the  former 
Italian  colony  of  Eritrea  bordering  the  Red  Sea,  picked  it  up.  Back  the  crypto- 
gram went  to  the  Signal  Security  Agency.  It  proved  to  be  in  purple,  which 
the  American  cryptanalysts  read  with  relative  ease.  The  solution  went  to 
General  Dwight  D.  Eisenhower’s  headquarters,  where  its  intelligence  helped 
shape  basic  strategy  for  the  conquest  of  Germany. 

The  success  of  the  invasion  stemmed  in  part  from  its  geographical  sur- 
prise, and  that  surprise  stemmed  largely  from  an  elaborate  deception  by  the 
Allies,  in  which  radio  played  the  major  role.  To  distract  German  attention 
from  the  real  landing  area  in  Normandy,  Eisenhower’s  headquarters  cooked 
up  a complete  cover-plan  codenamed  fortitude.  Parts  of  it  had  gone  into 
operation  more  than  a year  before  the  invasion.  Field  Marshal  Montgomery’s

radio  messages  were  not  broadcast  from  his  actual  location  in  the  south  of 
England,  but  were  led  by  land  line  to  a spoof  headquarters  near  Dover  and 
transmitted  from  there.  Dummy  ships  were  concentrated  in  the  Cinque  Ports 
to  help  the  illusion.  A very  busy  signals  staff  contrived,  by  sending  out  the 
right  sort  of  dummy  wireless  traffic,  to  “assemble”  a fictitious  4th  Army 
in  Scotland.  The  “wireless  training”  of  this  army  contained  some  purposeful 
indiscretions.  By  these  furtive,  impressionistic,  and  devious  indirections, 
fortitude  sought  to  let  the  Germans  convince  themselves  of  what  they  had 
always  wanted  to  believe  anyway — that  the  invaders  would  pour  across  the 
Channel  at  the  narrowest  point,  from  Dover  to  the  Pas  de  Calais;  the  build-up 
in  Scotland  suggested  a preliminary  feintlike  assault  on  southern  Norway. 
‘The  final  result  was  admirable,”  Churchill  wrote.  “The  German  High  Com- 
mand firmly  believed  the  evidence  we  obligingly  put  at  their  disposal.”  In  fact, 
so  conclusive  did  the  evidence  seem  to  be  that  more  than  a month  after  the 
invasion  in  Normandy,  Hitler  declared  that  “the  enemy  will  probably 
attempt  a second  landing  in  the  15th  Army’s  sector” — which  was  the  Pas  de 
Calais ! 

On  the  Normandy  beachhead,  the  solution  of  a German  message  enabled 
General  Omar  Bradley’s  12th  Army  Group  “to  meet  a very  strong  attack 
against  one  of  our  weaker  positions,”  he  said.  His  cryptanalytical  unit  was  the 
849th  Signal  Intelligence  Service  (formerly  the  radio  intelligence  company  of 
the  same  number).  Though  attached  to  the  army  group,  it  worked  not  at 
headquarters  but  in  the  field,  intercepting  and  cryptanalyzing  German 
messages  from  the  level  of  the  army  group  down  to  company.  The  material 
was  tactical  and  of  great  value  in  day-to-day  operations. 

In  the  fall  the  849th  moved  into  winter  quarters  in  a building  in  Luxem- 
bourg. About  the  first  of  December  it  began  to  read  German  messages  indi- 
cating the  movement  of  armored  divisions  behind  the  Ardennes  forest.  These 
increased  from  day  to  day,  but  G-2,  the  recipient  of  this  information,  appeared 
to  take  no  notice  whatever.  Finally,  on  the  Sunday  morning  of  December  17, 
the  unit  solved  messages  that  confirmed  what  the  cryptanalysts  had  long 
dreaded:  the  German  Panzer  attack.  Why  had  the  army  commanders  not 
heeded  the  intelligence — which  included  a great  variety  of  other  indications? 
They  did  not  believe  that  the  Germans  would  or  could  attack  with  armor 
through  so  heavily  wooded,  so  hilly,  and  so  generally  unfavorable  a terrain 
for  tanks.  The  Battle  of  the  Bulge  has  long  been  cited  as  a failure  of  intellig- 
ence. It  was  not  the  intelligence  that  failed,  however.  The  Bulge  was  a failure 
of  evaluation. 

Attached  to  Lieutenant  General  George  S.  Patton  Jr.’s  3rd  Army  was  a 
similar  radio  intelligence  unit,  commanded  by  Major  Charles  Flint,  regarded 
by  one  fellow  officer  as  “a  young,  trigger-smart  expert.”  Flint’s  outfit  was 
particularly  valuable  in  fluid  situations  when  the  Germans  were  on  the  move 
and  had  to  use  radio.  At  Bastogne,  it  solved  a message  that  enabled  Patton 
to  inflict  heavy  losses  on  the  redoubtable  5th  Para  Division.  Like  other  S.I.S.

units,  Flints  monitored  American  traffic;  it  once  warned  a mechanized- 
cavalry  transmitter  of  a communications-security  violation  that  might  have 
revealed  important  information  to  the  enemy. 

How  highly  the  Allies  regarded  communications  intelligence  was  demon- 
strated in  a left-handed  fashion  in  the  closing  days  of  the  war  by  the  case  of 
the  missing  sigaba.  Also  known  as  the  m-134-c,  the  sigaba,  which  had  been 
devised  by  William  Friedman,  was  a rotor  machine  like  the  German  Enigma 
and  British  typex;  like  them,  it  protected  top-level  communications — an 
interesting  case  of  parallel  evolution  and  an  indication  of  the  cryptographic 
success  of  the  rotor.  And  it  protected  them  exceedingly  well.  The  branch  of 
the  Army’s  Signal  Security  Agency  charged  with  testing  American  crypto- 
systems had  failed  in  all  its  efforts  to  break  down  messages  enciphered  in 
m-134-c.  And,  though  the  United  States  did  not  know  it  at  the  time,  German 
cryptanalysts  had,  despite  prolonged  efforts,  likewise  found  it  impossible  to 
read  these  cryptograms. 

But  all  the  cryptographic  ingenuity  built  into  the  machines  would  have 
been  expended  in  vain  had  only  one  of  them  fallen — even  briefly — into  the 
hands  of  the  enemy.  As  a result,  probably  nothing  in  the  war  zones  were 
guarded  as  closely  as  the  aba’s,  as  they  were  called  for  short.  Some  units  close 
to  the  front  moved  them  to  the  rear  each  night.  Heavy  safes  protected  them 
when  not  in  use — one  safe  for  the  basic  mechanism,  another  for  the  rotors  (for 
additional  key  changes,  the  machine  came  equipped  with  more  rotors  than 
the  five  it  used  at  a time),  a third,  apparently,  for  the  key  lists.  Armed  guards 
watched  over  them  continuously.  The  precautions  seemed  to  be  paying  off, 
for  to  the  Army  s knowledge,  not  one  aba  had  ever  been  compromised. 

But  on  the  night  of  February  3,  1 945,  two  aba  guards,  sergeants  of  the  28th 
Division,  parked  the  truck  in  which  they  were  transporting  the  three  safes  of  a 
divisional  aba  outside  a house  in  Colmar,  France,  and  paid  a brief  visit  to 
some  friendly  ladies.  When  they  emerged,  the  truck  and  its  safes  were  gone. 
Counterintelligence  began  at  once  to  search  for  it.  On  the  side  of  a road  near 
Colmar,  agents  found  a trailer  that  had  been  attached  to  the  truck — but  no 
truck,  no  safes,  and  no  aba. 

Panic  struck.  At  Eisenhower’s  headquarters,  security  and  cryptologic 
officers  went  frantic.  Ike  himself  was  concerned.  Colmar,  which  had  just  been 
liberated,  was  still  close  enough  to  the  front  for  German  collaborators  or 
agents  planted  by  the  retreating  Wermacht  to  have  stolen  the  aba’s.  Somehow 
they  might  have  gotten  through  the  fluid  front  lines  and  so  to  German  crypt- 
analysts. These  would  then  be  in  a position  to  do  what  they  had  not  been 
able  to  do  before.  For  with  a knowledge  of  the  wiring  of  the  aba  rotors,  the 
heart  of  the  system,  and  with  a working  mechanism  to  complete  their 
understanding,  all  the  German  cryptanalysts  would  have  to  do  would  be  to 
determine  which  rotors  in  the  set  had  been  used  for  a particular  message 
and  their  initial  setting.  This  would  not  be  easy,  but  it  certainly  could  be  done. 

The  danger  to  the  Allies  did  not  come  from  any  possible  future  solutions. 


Duel  in  the  Ether:  Neutrals  and  Allies 


511 


since  new  sets  of  rotors  were  issued  almost  immediately.  Rather  it  came  from 
the  past.  Eisenhower  and  his  high  subordinates  had  been  directing  the  greatest 
campaign  in  all  history  by  streams  of  ABA-sheathed  messages. These  were  all 
based  upon  the  well-matured  plans  of  high  strategy.  The  past  traffic  dealing 
with  supplies  alone  would  tell  the  Germans  a great  deal  about  Allied  poten- 
tialities, since  modern  war  is,  to  a very  considerable  degree,  a conflict  of 
logistics.  If  the  Germans  could  translate  their  back  files  of  intercepts  with  the 
missing  aba,  they  could  obtain  a profound  insight  into  the  broad  guidelines 
on  which  the  Allies  were  conducting  the  war  in  Western  Europe.  Nor  could 
the  Allies  easily  reshape  these  plans,  for  mountains  of  supplies  and  millions  of 
men  had  been  moved  to  conform  with  them.  Thus,  given  intelligence  of  this 
high  order,  and  the  massive  irreversible  momentum  of  modern  war,  the 
Germans  might  well  counter  Allied  moves  so  effectively  as  to  add  months  to 
the  war  and  thousands  of  lives  to  its  toll. 

None  of  this  was  lost  on  Eisenhower.  He  personally  pressed  the  com- 
mander of  his  6th  Army  Group,  General  Jacob  L.  Devers,  to  find  the  missing 
safes  at  all  costs,  and  Devers  assigned  the  task  to  his  group’s  chief  counter- 
intelligence officer,  Colonel  David  G.  Erskine. 

Erskine  began  by  sending  out  feelers  to  anti-Nazi  German  spies  in 
Switzerland  to  find  out  if  the  Nazis  had  been  congratulating  themselves  on 
some  extraordinary  feat  recently.  Then  he  spread  discreet  queries  through  the 
6th  Army  Group’s  area  to  determine  if  anyone  knew  anything  about  a missing 
truck  bearing  three  safes  containing  “highly  classified  documents.”  Perhaps  a 
French  civilian  or  an  American  soldier  had  appropriated  the  truck  without 
knowing  of  its  precious  cargo.  Any  American  finding  the  truck,  or  the  safes, 
or  both,  Erskine  announced,  would  get  that  coveted  reward:  home  leave.  No 
one  claimed  it. 

Erskine  sent  l-5  liaison  planes  skimming  low  over  Alsace,  but  their  pilots 
spotted  no  abandoned  trucks.  So  every  unit  commander  in  the  6th  Army 
Group  was  ordered  to  personally  check  the  serial  numbers  of  every  one  of  his 
vehicles  against  that  of  the  missing  truck.  Nothing.  The  search  was  extended 
over  most  of  the  front.  Military  policemen  checked  vehicles  at  roadblocks; 
canals  were  drained;  informants  were  checked.  The  mystery  just  deepened. 
Repeatedly,  Eisenhower  asked  Devers,  and  Devers  daily  asked  Erskine, 
whether  the  missing  aba  had  been  found. 

After  three  weeks  of  intensive  but  fruitless  search,  a special  squad  of 
American  and  French  counterintelligence  agents  was  formed  to  concentrate 
solely  on  the  loss.  In  charge  was  Lieutenant  Grant  Heilman,  a tall,  blond 
Pennsylvanian.  His  operation  got  off  to  an  embarrassing  start  when  two 
jeeps  parked  outside  his  headquarters  disappeared  as  mysteriously  as  had  the 
truck.  But  it  picked  up  when  Eisenhower  sent  a two-star  general,  Fay  B. 
Prickett,  to  Colmar  to  lend  authority  to  the  search.  Heilman  checked  every- 
thing, including  shelled  trucks  abandoned  at  the  bridge  over  the  Rhine. 
Erskine’s  Swiss  spies  returned  negative  reports,  and  his  hunch  that  French 


512 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

intelligence  might  have  taken  the  aba  to  improve  their  own  cryptology — 
checked  with  no  less  a personage  than  General  Charles  de  Gaulle,  head  of  the 
provisional  government — did  not  pan  out. 

Suddenly,  when  no  more  clues  could  be  discerned,  Erskine  got  a tip  from  a 
French  source.  Rushing  to  a sizable  creek  called  the  Giessen  River  near  the 
town  of  Selestat,  not  far  from  Colmar,  he  saw,  lying  in  the  mud,  two  of  the 
missing  300-pound  safes.  It  seemed  likely  that  they  had  been  dumped  into  the 
Giessen  from  a masonry  bridge  about  a hundred  yards  upstream  from  where 
they  had  been  found  and  had  been  rolled  downstream  by  the  strong  current. 
Erskine  immediately  ordered  a search  of  the  banks  for  the  third  safe.  They 
were  barren. 

Divers  were  brought  in  from  Cherbourg  to  examine  the  stream  bed.  They 
found  nothing.  Erskine  decided  to  dam  the  stream  and  dredge  the  bottom 
with  a bulldozer.  In  three  days  the  dam  was  built  and  the  bottom  scoured — 
with  no  luck.  Heilman,  feeling  hopeless,  began  to  search  the  muddy  portion 
of  the  bed  that  the  falling  waters  had  exposed.  Suddenly  something  metallic 
glinted  in  the  sun.  He  rushed  over — and  found  his  own  buried  treasure.  It  was 
the  missing  safe.  Both  its  handles  had  been  knocked  off  by  rocks,  but  other- 
wise it  appeared,  on  checking  by  Signal  Corps  officers,  to  be  intact. 

Thus,  on  March  20,  the  search  for  the  missing  sigaba  ended,  six  frantic 
weeks  after  it  had  begun.  Erskine,  checking  again  with  the  French,  this  time 
on  an  I-don’t-want-anyone-punished  basis,  discovered  that  a French  military 
chauffeur  who  had  lost  his  truck  in  Colmar  “borrowed”  the  American  one 
while  the  sergeants  were  in  the  brothel,  and,  afraid  that  he  might  be  accused 
of  stealing  the  safes,  pushed  them  off  the  bridge  into  the  Giessen.  This  ruled 
out  the  possibility  that  the  secret  mechanism  had  ever  been  in  the  hands  of  the 
enemy. 

Heilman  was  promoted  to  captain.  Both  he  and  Erskine  were  awarded  the 
Bronze  Star.  Uncounted  man-hours  had  been  squandered  in  the  search  and 
an  unknown  toll  of  nervous  energy  taken.  But  the  precious  messages  were 
safe,  and  with  them  the  plans  that  within  a few  more  weeks  directed  the  Allies 
to  victory.

CENSORS,  SCRAMBLERS,  AND  SPIES 

CIPHER  IS  THE  language  of  spies — and  usually  they  must  talk  in 
whispers.  A spy’s  success,  his  very  existence,  depends  on  his  not  being  seen  or 
heard.  Sending  messages  in  obviously  cryptographic  form  would  alert 
counterespionage  to  him  as  effectively  as  wearing  a cloak  and  dagger.  Yet  he 
must  transmit,  else  he  is  useless.  So  he  eschews  the  overt  methods  of  secret 
communications  for  the  covert.  He  resorts  to  open  codes,  hollow  heels, 
invisible  inks,  microscopically  small  missives — the  steganographic  methods 
that  conceal  the  very  fact  that  a message  is  being  sent.  He  seeks  to  communi- 
cate unnoticed. 

And  to  block  this  very  attempt  and  root  out  the  enemy  within,  govern- 
ments erect  great  filters  at  their  mail  and  cable  ports  of  entry  to  prevent  and 
detect  these  clandestine  communications.  These  sieves,  which  let  innocent 
messages  flow  through,  are  the  censorship  organizations. 

Descended  in  a sense  from  the  black  chambers  of  the  1700s,  they  are 
creatures  of  war  in  democracies  and  of  tyranny  in  dictatorships.  Censorship 
first  sprang  up  on  a major  scale  in  World  War  I,  and  the  lessons  that  Britain 
learned  then  she  put  to  good  use  twenty  years  later  when  she  again  filtered 
communications.  Even  before  the  United  States  entered  the  war,  British 
censorship  had  caught  two  major  German  spies  in  the  United  States  and  its 
protectorate  of  Cuba. 

In  December,  1940,  one  of  the  1,200  examiners  that  British  censorship 
had  installed  in  the  commodious  Princess  Hotel  in  Bermuda  stopped  a letter 
addressed  to  Berlin  from  New  York.  He  suspected  it  because  it  described  a 
list  of  Allied  shipping  and  used  several  expressions — such  as  “cannon  for 
“guns”  in  describing  the  vessels’  armament — that  suggested  the  writer  might 
be  German  and  a possible  Nazi  agent.  The  letter  was  signed  “Joe  K.  A watch 
set  up  for  more  letters  with  his  handwriting  soon  picked  out  quite  a few  more, 
mostly  to  Spain  and  Portugal.  Their  language  seemed  slightly  forced,  and  a 
team  began  studying  the  letters  to  see  whether  this  indicated  an  open  code 
and,  if  so,  what  the  real  meaning  was. 

One  member  of  the  team  was  a persistent  young  woman  named  Nadya 
Gardner,  who  became  convinced  that  the  letters  contained  invisible  writing. 
The  usual  strip  tests  with  chemicals  that  bring  out  the  ordinary  secret  inks

gave  negative  results,  but  Miss  Gardner  persisted.  Finally  the  chemists,  under 
Dr.  Enrique  Dent,  applied  the  iodine-vapor  test  invented  back  in  World  War 
I — and  to  their  surprise  secret  writing  did  appear  on  the  back  of  the  typed 
sheets.  The  letter  of  April  15,  1941,  addressed  to  Mr.  Manuel  Alonso, 
Apartado  718,  Madrid,  carried  on  the  back  of  its  two  pages  a list  of  ships  then 
docked  at  New  York:  “On  April  14  was  at  pier  97  (Manhattan)  the  Norwegian 
M.  S.  Tain  Shan — 6601  tons — gray  superstr#  at  pier  90  was  a Dutch  freighter 
. ...”  A letter  of  six  days  later,  addressed  to  a Miss  Isabel  Machado  Santos  in 
Lisbon,  reported  in  invisible  ink  that  “British  have  about  70,000  men  on 
Iceland#  The  S.S.  Ville  de  Liege  was  sunk  about  April  14 — many  thanks# 
Types  of  airplanes  flown  to  England  (continued  from  letter  69) — 3.  Boeing 
b-17c  (model  299t)  twenty  were  released  by  the  U.S.  Army  to  Britain  on 
Nov  20  . . . .”  These  little  billets-doux  were  written  in  a solution  of  pyramidon, 
a powder  often  used  as  a headache  cure  and  readily  obtainable  at  most 
pharmacies. 

But  there  was  still  no  clue  as  to  the  sender.  The  letters  bore  no  return  ad- 
dress, and  it  was  rather  unlikely  that  “Joe  K”  was  the  spy’s  real  first  name 
and  last  initial.  Finally,  British  censorship  picked  out  another  Joe  K letter 
that  reported  that  “Phil”  had  been  fatally  injured  in  a New  York  traffic 
accident  on  March  18  and  had  died  at  St.  Vincent’s  Hospital.  F.B.I.  agents 
found  that  the  man  in  the  accident  was  known  as  Julio  Lopez  Lido,  and  that 
witnesses  had  seen  that  a man  with  Lido  had  grabbed  his  briefcase  after  the 
accident  and  hurried  away.  Eventually,  the  agents  learned  that  Lido’s  true 
name  was  Ulrich  von  der  Osten  and  that  the  writer  of  the  Joe  K letters  was 
Kurt  Frederick  Ludwig.  Ludwig,  born  in  Ohio  but  raised  in  Germany,  had 
come  to  the  United  States  in  March  of  1940  to  organize  a spy  ring,  which 
he  had  done  with  moderate  success. 

When  captured,  he  had  several  bottles  of  pyramidon  in  his  possession.  The 
odd  tone  of  the  open  text  of  his  letters  was  accounted  for  by  its  double 
meanings.  “Your  order  5 is  rather  large — and  I with  my  limited  facilities  and 
funds  shall  never  be  able  to  fill  such  an  immense  order  completely,”  he  wrote 
to  one  of  his  addressees — all  of  them,  incidentally,  cover  addresses  for 
Himmler.  This  message  really  meant  that  he  would  have  difficulty  fulfilling 
the  instructions  sent  him  in  communication  No.  5 because  of  too  few  agents 
and  too  little  money.  Ludwig  was  convicted  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  at 
Brooklyn. 

The  second  spy  trapped  by  the  alert  Bermuda  station  went  to  his  death. 
On  a November  day  in  1941,  an  alert  censor  detected  a rather  Germanic  cast 
to  the  handwriting  in  a Spanish-language  letter  from  Havana  to  Lisbon  and 
sent  it  over  for  a routine  test  for  secret  ink.  His  intuition  was  confirmed  when 
a long  missive  appeared,  listing  ships  being  loaded  in  Havana  harbor  and 
discussing  an  airfield  being  constructed.  The  examiners  were  alerted  to  watch 
for  similar  handwriting.  The  next  letter  turned  up  a few  days  later.  Censor- 
ship continued  picking  out  these  letters,  which  recited  details  of  merchant

shipping  in  Cuban  waters  and  of  the  enlargement  of  the  U.S.  Navy’s  base  at 
Guantanamo  Bay,  until  the  writer’s  real  Havana  address  showed  up  in 
secret  ink.  Letters  posted  to  this  address  were  watched,  and  on  September  5, 
1942,  after  sufficient  evidence  had  been  amassed,  police  arrested  “R.  Castillo,” 
who  proved  to  be  Heinz  August  Luning.  He  had  been  sent  to  Havana  from 
Germany  in  September,  1941,  and  of  the  48  letters  he  had  sent  to  Europe,  the 
Bermuda  censors  had  intercepted  all  but  five.  On  November  9,  1942,  he  went 
before  a firing  squad  at  Principe  Fortress,  the  first  man  in  Cuba  to  be  executed 
as  a spy. 

Soon  after  Pearl  Harbor,  the  United  States  built  up  a censorship  service 
that  began  in  the  borrowed  office  in  which  Byron  Price  went  to  work  as  Chief 
Censor  and  grew  to  an  organization  whose  14,462  examiners  occupied  90  buil- 
dings throughout  the  country,  opened  a million  pieces  of  overseas  mail  a day, 
listened  to  innumerable  telephone  conversations,  and  scanned  movies,  maga- 
zines, and  radio  scripts.  Millions  became  familiar  with  the  “Opened  by 
Censor”  sticker  and  the  scissored  letter. 

To  plug  up  as  many  steganographic  channels  of  communication  as  pos- 
sible, the  Office  of  Censorship  banned  in  advance  the  sending  of  whole  classes 
of  objects  or  kinds  of  messages.  International  chess  games  by  mail  were 
stopped.  Crossword  puzzles  were  extracted  from  letters,  for  the  examiners 
did  not  have  time  to  solve  them  to  see  if  they  concealed  a secret  message,  and 
so  were  newspaper  clippings,  which  might  have  spelled  out  messages  by  dotting 
successive  letters  with  secret  ink— a modern  version  of  a system  described 
more  than  2,000  years  earlier  by  Aeneas  the  Tactician.  Listing  of  students’ 
grades  was  tabooed.  One  letter  containing  knitting  instructions  was  held  up 
long  enough  for  an  examiner  to  knit  a sweater  to  see  if  the  given  sequence  of 
knit  two  and  cast  off  contained  a hidden  message  like  that  of  Madame  De- 
farge,  who  knitted  into  her  “shrouds”  the  names  of  further  enemies  of  the 
French  Republic,  “whose  lives  the  guillotine  then  surely  swallowed  up.”  A 
stamp  bank  was  maintained  at  each  censorship  station;  examiners  removed 
loose  stamps,  which  might  spell  out  a code  message,  and  replaced  them  with 
others  of  equal  value,  but  of  different  number  and  denomination.  Blank 
paper,  often  sent  from  the  United  States  to  relatives  in  paper-short  countries, 
was  similarly  replaced  from  a paper  bank  to  obviate  secret-ink  transmissions. 
Childish  scrawls,  sent  from  proud  parents  to  proud  grandparents,  were  re- 
moved because  of  the  possibility  of  their  covering  a map.  Even  lovers’  X’s, 
meant  as  kisses,  were  heartlessly  deleted  if  censors  thought  they  might  be  a 
code. 

Censorship  cable  regulations  prohibited  sending  any  text  that  was  unclear 
to  the  censor,  including  numbers  unrelated  to  the  text  or  a personal  note  in  a 
business  communication,  and  that  was  not  in  English,  French,  Spanish,  or 
Portuguese  plain  language.  To  kill  any  possible  sub  rosa  message,  censors 
sometimes  paraphrased  messages.  This  practice  gave  rise  to  Censorship’s 
classic  tale,  which  dates  back  to  World  War  I.  Onto  the  desk  of  a censor

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


was  placed  the  cablegram  Father  is  dead.  The  censor  considered  it  briefly, 
changed  it  to  Father  is  deceased,  and  forwarded  it.  Soon  thereafter  the  reply 
appeared  on  his  desk:  Is  Father  dead  or  deceased? 

Cables  ordering  flowers — “Deliver  three  white  orchids  to  my  wife 
Saturday” — offered  so  blatant  an  invitation  to  clandestine  communication 
that  the  censors  forbade  naming  the  kind  of  flower  and  the  date  of  delivery, 
leaving  both  up  to  the  individual  florist.  Later  in  the  war,  all  international 
flower  messages  were  prohibited  by  the  United  States  and  Great  Britain 
because  of  the  danger  of  their  masking  signals.  Only  those  between  the  U.S. 
and  her  territories  and  between  the  U.S.,  Canada,  and  Mexico  were  permitted. 
The  censorship  permitted  only  nine  of  the  most  widely  used  commercial 
codes,  and  every  coded  message  had  to  include  an  indicating  abbreviation  in 
its  preamble.  A firm  could  not  use  its  private  code  without  a special  license 
from  the  director  of  censorship,  who  required  that  fifteen  copies  of  the  code- 
book be  furnished  for  use  by  the  censors.* 

Precautions  were  taken  with  the  mass  media,  too.  Newspapers  were  warned 
to  be  careful  in  taking  want  ads.  Prevention  was  directed  mainly  at  commer- 
cial radio,  which  could  instantaneously  deliver  open-code  secret  messages  to 
listening  submarines  or  enemy  agents  with  the  greatest  of  ease.  Such  possi- 
bilities had  been  driven  home  forcefully  to  the  broadcasting  industry  a year 
before  Pearl  Harbor  in  a test  conducted  by  a military  intelligence  officer.  By 
having  an  announcer  mention  England’s  Queen  Elizabeth,  the  officer  wove 
into  an  interview  with  former  heavyweight  champion  Max  Baer  the  hidden 
message:  S-1 12:  Queen  Elizabeth  sails  tonight  with  hundreds  of  airplanes  for 
Halifax.  What  was  disturbing  was  that  neither  the  announcer,  the  station 
manager,  Baer,  nor  any  of  the  thousands  of  listeners  on  the  nationwide 
hook-up  except  those  who  had  been  initiated  into  the  secret  were  aware  that 
the  message  had  been  broadcast.  With  this  in  mind,  the  Office  of  Censorship 
ruled  that  telephone  or  telegraph  requests  for  phonograph  records  were  not  to 
be  honored,  and  that  mail  requests  must  be  held  for  an  irregular,  unspecified 
time  before  playing.  This  would  defeat  any  attempts  to  have  “Jersey  Bounce” 
tell  a waiting  U-boat  that  Convoy  sails  today.  The  same  situation  applied  to 

* At  the  start  of  the  war  in  September,  1 939,  the  Allies  prohibited  the  use  of  any  codes  at 
all.  But  pressure  of  business  houses  and  realization  that  commercially  coded  messages  were 
only  a step  up  from  plaintext  forced  them  to  relent,  and  at  the  end  of  December  they  per- 
mitted the  use  of  Bentley's  Complete  Phrase  Code,  Bentley's  Second  Phrase  Code,  the  ABC 
Code  (6th  edition),  and  Peterson's  Code  (3rd  edition).  In  April,  1940,  they  admitted  five 
more  codes:  Acme  Code  and  Supplement,  Lombard  General  Code,  Lombard  Shipping  Code 
and  Appendix,  New  Standard  Half  Word  Code,  and  New  Standard  Three  Letter  Code.  These 
were  the  nine  later  allowed  by  the  United  States  and  most  of  the  Latin  American  nations. 
Under  pressure  from  the  Allies,  Argentina,  which  had  not  severed  diplomatic  relations  with 
the  Axis,  halted  all  code  communications — but  the  first  code  message  stopped  was  one  from 
the  Vatican!  During  the  war,  even  neutrals  such  as  Spain  and  Sweden  demanded  copies  of 
the  codes  used  and  prohibited  the  use  of  (secret)  cipher.  Only  Switzerland  placed  no  restric- 
tions on  either  code  or  cipher  communication.

Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

the  personal  ads,  such  as  for  lost  dogs,  that  local  stations  broadcast.  Halted 
completely  were  man-in-the-street  interviews  and  Santa  Claus  lists  of  toys 
that  children  wanted. 

Preventive  censorship  like  this  was  only  half  the  job,  however.  It  could 
not  be  expected  that  spies  would  limit  themselves  to  such  easily  confounded 
methods  of  communication.  The  other  half  of  the  job  was  the  detection  of  the 
other  methods  that  they  might  use.  To  sharpen  Censorship’s  spy-catching 
tools  by  coordinating  and  assisting  the  field  stations  that  spotted  the  hidden 
messages  and  by  improving  liaison  with  counterespionage  agencies  like  the 
F.B.I.,  Price  in  May  of  1943  established  the  Technical  Operations  Division  at 
headquarters,  appointing  Lieutenant  Colonel  Harold  R.  Shaw  as  its  chief  and 
an  assistant  director  in  the  Office  of  Censorship.  Shaw,  39,  son  of  a Regular 
Army  officer,  had  been  commissioned  in  the  Army  Reserve  upon  his  gradua- 
tion from  the  University  of  Hawaii.  He  maintained  a strong  interest  in 
military  intelligence  while  working  in  soil  physics  and  chemistry  and  hydraul- 
ics as  irrigation  superintendent  of  a large  sugar  plantation  on  Oahu.  In  the 
fall  of  1941,  after  being  called  to  active  duty,  he  had  taken  an  intensive  two- 
month  course  with  14  other  reservists  who  would  serve  as  the  nucleus  of  a 
postal  censorship  in  case  of  war.  The  training  was  conducted  by  Major  W.  P. 
(Red)  Corderman  in  a three-story  brick  office  building  in  Clarendon,  Virginia, 
a sleepy  suburb  of  Washington ; one  of  the  most  frequent  lecturers  was  William 
F.  Friedman.  Across  the  street  a group  of  Navy  Reserve  officers  under  Captain 
Herbert  K.  Fenn  was  similarly  planning  the  details  for  cable  and  radio  censor- 
ship. Fenn,  a World  War  I base  censor  and  a Navy  communications  expert, 
later  became  Chief  Cable  Censor.  One  of  Shaw’s  classmates,  Norman  V. 
Carlson,  president  of  a San  Francisco  movie-camera  firm,  early  in  the  war 
replaced  Corderman  as  Chief  Postal  Censor.  With  the  outbreak  of  war,  Shaw 
rushed  back  to  Hawaii  to  become  District  Postal  Censor  and  Chief  Military 
Censor.  Price  recalled  him  from  there  to  head  the  Technical  Operations 
Division. 

T.O.D.  was  quartered  in  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  Building,  the 
three-sided  structure  that  housed  the  Office  of  Censorship  at  Pennsylvania 
and  Constitution  avenues  in  Washington.  Shaw  administered  it  from  Room 
509  with  three  assistants  and  a secretarial  staff.  Two  technical  sections  oper- 
ated under  maximum  security  in  a windowless,  guarded  area  on  the  seventh, 
or  top,  floor.  The  laboratory  was  headed  by  Dr.  Elwood  C.  Pierce,  a bio- 
chemist at  the  University  of  Indiana  who  had  joined  Censorship  at  the  start 
of  the  war.  He  and  his  assistant,  Dr.  Willard  Breon  of  the  University  of 
Maryland  chemistry  faculty,  had  prepared  a manual  on  detection  of  secret 
inks,  trained  key  personnel  of  the  censorship  field  stations  in  laboratory 
operation,  and  handled  some  of  the  more  active  and  difficult  cases  themselves. 
From  Hawaii  Shaw  imported  his  trusted  cryptanalytic  expert  to  form  a unit 
“capable,”  he  said,  “not  only  of  cracking  codes  and  ciphers  but  also  of 
building  the  intricate  dossiers  of  personal  history,  contacts,  handwriting

peculiarities,  and  correspondence  habits  of  each  actual  and  suspected  espion- 
age agent.”  The  man  who  could  do  it  was  Armen  Abdian,  a former  New 
Englander  who  had  come  to  Hawaii  in  the  prewar  Army,  had  taught  a 
cram  course  for  prospective  West  Pointers,  and  had  gone  into  business  in 
Honolulu. 

T O D.  also  drew  upon  the  pool  of  scientific  knowledge  of  the  Office  of 
Scientific  Research  and  Development.  Each  month,  Shaw  and  his  technical 
aides  met  with  a bevy  of  physics  and  chemistry  Ph.D.’s  in  the  board  room  of 
Harvard  s Mallinckrodt  Chemical  Laboratory.  Arthur  B.  Lamb,  professor  of 
chemistry  at  Harvard  and  editor  of  the  Journal  of  the  American  Chemical 
Society,  presided  over  a group  that  included  Robley  D.  Evans,  a physicist  at 
the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  Harris  M.  Chadwell,  a physical 
chemist  at  Tufts  University,  Warren  C.  Lothrop,  an  organic  chemist  at  Con- 
necticut’s Trinity  College,  S.  Edward  Eaton,  a chemist  at  Arthur  D.  Little, 
Inc.,  and  George  Richter,  an  expert  in  inks  and  papers  with  the  Eastman 
Kodak  Company.  In  addition,  Sanborn  C.  Brown,  a young  faculty  member 
of  M.I.T.  who  worked  as  a “free  physicist”  for  the  O.S.R.D.’s  National 
Defense  Research  Committee,  unraveling  puzzlers  that  had  baffled  other 
agencies,  such  as  ways  of  de-arming  booby  traps  and  the  causes  of  mysterious 
accidents  to  dive-bomber  pilots,  attacked  some  of  the  toughest  technical 
problems  faced  by  Censorship. 

The  primary  detection  of  clandestine  communications  took  place  in  the 
censorship  field  stations.  Largest  of  all  was  New  York’s,  filling  a huge  building 
on  lower  Eighth  Avenue.  About  4,500  postal  examiners  scanned  the  snow- 
drifts of  mail  that  piled  onto  their  desks  each  day.  They  excised  all  matter 
that  might  have  injured  the  Allied  war  effort,  and  they  looked  closely  for 
traces  of  hidden  messages.  Censorship  had  catalogued  the  occupations  and 
hobbies  of  its  examiners.  A balance  sheet  would  be  given  to  an  accountant 
to  see  whether  it  made  financial  sense;  an  amateur  horticulturist  could  tell 
whether  a discussion  of  tulip  beds  rang  true.  Once  an  examiner  in  New  York 
was  perturbed  by  a letter  from  Germany  to  a prisoner  of  war  in  the  United 
States,  saying  that  Gertrude  was  developing  into  a swimming  champion  and 
listing  the  times  of  her  victories.  He  consulted  an  amateur  swimmer  in  the 
office,  who  reported  that  the  speeds  were  impossible.  Further  investigation 
revealed  that  the  times  actually  indicated  the  speed  of  a new  fighter  plane, 
given  by  a war  worker  who  could  not  resist  bragging.  The  factory  was  later 
bombed.  Censors  in  a political  section  looked  for  clues  to  hoards  of  vital 
material  that  might  be  bought  by  the  Allies  to  preclude  the  Axis  from  getting 
it.  An  economic  section  extracted  remarks  about  shortages  and  living  con- 
ditions to  help  build  up  pictures  of  national  economies.  Letters  in  uncommon 
languages  went  to  a language  identification  section,  which  obtained  translators 
for  such  esoteric  tongues  as  Ladino,  a mixture  of  Hebrew  and  15th-century 
Spanish  spoken  only  by  the  30,000  Sephardic  Jews  in  colonies  in  Spain,  the 
Balkans,  and  Latin  America.

Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

Floor  examiners  passed  all  messages  with  peculiar  wording,  odd-looking 
marks,  or  other  suspected  indications  to  the  security  division,  which  had  two 
sections  to  examine  steganograms  concealed  in  the  two  basic  ways — 
linguistically  and  technologically.  These  were  the  code  and  cipher  section  for 
the  linguistic  steganograms  and  the  laboratory  section  for  the  technological. 
Both  were  linked  to  T.O.D.  by  a security  assistant  who  implemented  T.O.D.’s 
instructions  and  passed  the  more  recalcitrant  problems  back  to  Washington. 
The  70  examiners  in  the  New  York  code  and  cipher  section  occupied  about 
half  the  14th  floor,  with  some  of  the  more  expert  people  constituted  as  a 
specialist  group.  About  30  technicians  tested  for  secret  inks  in  the  laboratory 
next  door. 

Linguistically  concealed  messages  fall  into  two  general  categories,  the 
semagram  and  the  open  code.  There  are  three  kinds  of  open  code:  the  jargon 
code,  the  null  cipher,  and  geometrical  systems  like  the  Cardano  grille.  In 
the  jargon  code,  an  apparently  innocuous  word  stands  for  the  real  term  in  a 
text  contrived  to  seem  as  bland  and  as  innocent  as  possible.  Jargon  codes  can 
range  from  the  most  informal  sort  of  code  to  a full  code  list.  They  begin  with 
mere  allusions  to  mutually  known  events  and  persons — “I  visited  the  man  you 
had  dinner  with  last  week.”  They  continue  through  double  meanings  that 
would  be  easily  understood  by  the  recipient,  as  one  criminal’s  referring  to 
another’s  arrest  by  saying  “Joe  went  to  the  hospital.”  They  culminate  in  a 
prearranged  table  of  artificial  meanings.  Jargon  has  been  popular  since  the 
dawn  of  cryptography.  The  Chinese  employed  it;  the  oldest  papal  code  is  the 
14th-century  use  of  Egyptians  for  Ghibellines  and  sons  of  Israel  for  Guelphs\ 
in  the  17th  century  a French  code  consisted  entirely  of  such  jargon  expres- 
sions as  garden  for  Rome,  rose  for  the  pope,  plum  tree  for  the  Cardinal  de 
Retz,  window  for  Monsieur  the  king's  brother,  and  staircase  for  the  Marquis 
de  Coeuvres.  It  is  clear  that  skillful  application  of  jargon’s  literary  veneer 
requires  no  little  finesse! 

Censorship  defends  itself  against  this  ruse  by  a feel  for  stilted  or  heavy- 
handed  language  and  by  a healthy  skepticism  concerning  subject  matter.  The 
standard  story  about  jargon  comes  from  World  War  I.  A British  censor  grew 
suspicious  of  the  enormous  orders  for  cigars  wired  each  day — mostly  from 
port  towns — by  two  “Dutch  businessmen.”  One  day  Portsmouth  called  for 
10,000  Coronas;  the  next  day  Plymouth  and  Devonport  craved  large  quanti- 
ties of  stogies;  then  Newcastle  succumbed  overnight  to  the  tobacco  habit.  It 
seemed  as  though  all  the  males  in  the  coastal  population  of  England  had  sud- 
denly and  simultaneously  developed  an  irresistible  addiction  to  the  weed, 
so  inexhaustible  was  the  demand  for  cigars.  At  the  suggestion  of  the  censor,  a 
check  was  made;  the  two  businessmen  proved  to  be  German  spies,  and  their 
orders  an  open  code,  in  which,  say  5,000  Coronas  for  Newcastle  meant  five 
cruisers  lying  in  that  port.  On  July  30,  1915,  the  two — Haicke  P.  M.  Janssen 
and  Wilhelm  R.  Roos — were  executed  at  the  Tower  of  London  by  a firing 
squad  whose  triggers  were  really  pulled  by  an  alert  censor.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


So  long  as  jargon  codes  can  pass  unnoticed,  they  are,  naturally,  safe.  But 
they  nearly  always  give  up  their  secrets  soon  after  detection.  Paradoxically, 
the  less  suspect  they  are,  the  easier  they  are  to  solve  when  discovered : because 
the  more  they  throw  the  burden  of  communication  on  the  context,  the  more 
information  the  context  contains  that  may  be  used  as  a lever  to  pry  out  the 
secret  meaning.  Thus  in  World  War  II,  a series  of  letters  evidencing  a legiti- 
mate if  somewhat  neurotic  concern  for  dolls  apparently  eluded  censorship. 
Suspicion  was  drawn  to  them  when  one  was  returned  from  Buenos  Aires, 
marked  “Unknown  at  this  address,”  to  the  person  marked  as  the  sender,  a 
woman  in  Portland,  Oregon.  Not  having  sent  it,  she  brought  it  to  the  F.B.I. 
“I  just  secured  a lovely  Siamese  Temple  Dancer,”  the  letter  said  in  part,  “it 
had  been  damaged,  that  is  tore  in  the  middle.  But  it  is  now  repaired  and  I like 
it  very  much.  I could  not  get  a mate  for  this  Siam  dancer,  so  I am  redressing 
just  a small  ordinary  doll  into  a second  Siam  doll. . . .”  Then  other  doll  letters, 
all  in  the  same  disconnected  feminine  style  filled  with  typographical  errors, 
were  intercepted  by  censors.  “A  broken  doll  in  a hulu  grass  skirt  will  have  all 
damages  repaired  by  the  first  week  of  February,”  and  “The  broken  English 
dolls  will  be  in  a doll  hospital  for  a few  months  before  repairs  can  be  com- 
pleted. The  doll  hospital  is  working  day  and  night.” 

T.O.D.  and  F.B.I.  cryptanalysts  soon  determined  that  the  dolls  represented 
warships  in  a jargon  code,  each  kind  a specific  type  of  ship.  The  innocent 
chatter  assumed  sinister  overtones:  “Light  cruiser  Honolulu  will  have  all 
damages  repaired  by  the  first  week  of  February.”  “The  damaged  English 
warships  will  be  in  a shipyard  for  several  months  before  repairs  can  be  com- 
pleted. The  shipyard  is  working  day  and  night.”  “I  just  secured  information 
of  a lovely  aircraft  carrier,  it  had  been  damaged,  that  is  torpedoed  in  the 
middle.  But  it  is  now  repaired  [the  “and  I like  it  very  much”  just  adds  to  the 
air  of  innocence],  A second  carrier  could  not  be  obtained,  so  another  ship  is 
being  converted  to  an  aircraft  carrier.”  But  no  clue  as  to  the  writer  emerged 
until  she  used  as  a return  address  a woman  with  whom  she  had  had  a spat. 
When  an  F.B.I.  agent  checked  with  this  woman  to  ask  if  she  knew  who  might 
have  been  using  her  address,  she  named  Mrs.  Velvalee  Dickinson,  who  ran 
an  exclusive  doll  shop  on  New  York’s  Madison  Avenue.  A Japanophile  and 
friend  of  prominent  Japanese,  she  was  later  found  to  have  received  thousands 
of  dollars  from  Japanese  officials.  She  was  charged  with  espionage,  which 
could  have  brought  the  death  penalty,  but  was  allowed  to  plead  guilty  to  the 
lesser  charge  of  violating  wartime  censorship  regulations  by  illegally  using 
codes  in  international  communications  and  was  sentenced  to  ten  years  in 
jail  and  a $10,000  fine. 

A second  type  of  open  code  is  the  null  cipher.  Only  certain  letters  or 
words  of  a null  cipher’s  text  are  significant;  for  example,  every  fifth  word  or 
the  first  letter  of  every  word,  with  all  the  other  letters  and  words  serving  as 
nulls  to  produce  the  disguise.  These  usually  sound  even  more  strained  than 
the  jargon  code.  Even  two  of  the  better  examples,  sent  by  the  Germans  during 


521 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

World  War  I,  have  that  “funny”  sound  that  invariably  accompanies  them. 
The  first,  disguised  as  a press  cable,  read : 

president’s  embargo  ruling  should  have  immediate  notice. 

GRAVE  SITUATION  AFFECTING  INTERNATIONAL  LAW.  STATEMENT  FORE- 
SHADOWS RUIN  OF  MANY  NEUTRALS.  YELLOW  JOURNALS  UNIFYING 
NATIONAL  EXCITEMENT  IMMENSELY. 

The  initial  letters  spell  out  Pershing  sails  from  N.  Y.  June  1.  The  second  mes- 
sage, apparently  sent  as  a check  on  the  first,  beaded  the  same  content  on  the 
second  letters  of  each  word : 

APPARENTLY  NEUTRAL’S  PROTEST  IS  THOROUGHLY  DISCOUNTED  AND 
IGNORED.  ISMAN  HARD  HIT.  BLOCKADE  ISSUE  AFFECTS  PRETEXT  FOR 
EMBARGO  ON  BYPRODUCTS,  EJECTING  SUETS  AND  VEGETABLE  OILS. 

Whoever  the  sender  was,  his  ingenuity  was  expended  in  vain,  since  Pershing 
actually  sailed  May  28. 

Most  null  ciphers  in  World  War  II  were  used  not  by  spies,  but  by  other- 
wise loyal  Americans  who  could  not  resist  trying  to  “beat  the  censor.” 
Servicemen  in  particular  attempted  to  sneak  information  about  their  where- 
abouts to  families  who  otherwise  would  quite  literally  not  know  where  in  the 
world  their  soldier  boy  was — even  though  such  attempts  endangered  the 
serviceman’s  own  life. 

One  such  system,  though  elementary,  brought  deserved  bewilderment 
instead  of  clarification  to  its  intended  recipients.  A young  GI,  following  a 
prearranged  system  with  his  parents,  tried  to  tell  them  he  was  in  Tunis  by 
using  first  t,  then  u,  then  n,  i,  and  s as  his  father’s  middle  initial  in  successive 
letters  home.  Unfortunately,  he  forgot  to  date  them  and  they  arrived  out  of 
order.  The  frantic  parents  wrote  that  they  had  looked  and  looked  through 
their  atlas  but  couldn’t  find  Nutsi  anywhere!  Attempts  of  this  sort  grew  so 
frequent  by  1943  that  the  Navy  had  to  warn  its  sailors  that  these  “family 
codes,”  which  were  usually  solved  quite  easily,  could  lead  to  severe  penalties 
for  the  users. 

The  third  kind  of  open  code  is  the  geometrical.  A Cardano  grille  places 
the  message-bearing  words  in  fixed  positions  on  a page.  The  significant  words 
can  be  placed  at  intersections  of  the  lines  of  a geometrical  diagram  of  specified 
dimensions.  In  the  1600s,  Sir  John  Trevanion,  a Cavalier  awaiting  trial  and 
almost  certain  execution  by  Cromwell’s  forces,  noted  the  third  letter  after 
each  punctuation  mark  in  a letter  that  his  jailers  had  scrutinized  before 
giving  him  and  learned  that  Panel  at  east  end  of  chapel  slides.  He  disappeared 
during  vespers.  And  in  World  War  II,  captured  U-boat  officers  spelled  out 
secret  messages  in  their  letters  home  by  breaking  the  flow  of  script  after  each 
significant  letter.  An  alert  censor  noticed  that  the  minute  gaps  did  not  occur 
in  natural  places,  as  after  syllables.  The  hidden  messages  described  Allied 
anti-submarine  tactics  and  technical  U-boat  faults.  Some  outlined  escape 
plans — which  were,  of  course,  foiled.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  second  category  of  linguistically  concealed  messages  is  the  semagram 
(from  the  Greek  “sema,”  for  “sign”).  A semagram  is  a steganogram  in  which 
the  ciphertext  substitutes  consist  of  anything  but  letters  or  numbers.  The 
astragal  of  Aeneas  the  Tactician,  in  which  yarn  passing  through  holes  repre- 
senting letters  carried  the  secret  message,  is  the  oldest  known  semagram.  A 
box  of  Mah-Jongg  tiles  might  carry  a secret  message.  So  might  a drawing  in 
which  two  kinds  of  objects  represented  the  dots  and  dashes  of  Morse  Code  to 
spell  out  a message.  The  New  York  censorship  station  once  shifted  the  hands 
and  altered  the  positions  of  the  individual  timepieces  in  a shipment  of  watches 
lest  a message  be  concealed  in  it. 

The  examination  of  the  linguistically  concealed  messages — or,  more  cor- 
rectly, those  suspected  to  be  such — was  largely  a frustrating  experience.  Often 
the  examiner  could  not  tell  whether  or  not  a message  was  hidden  beneath  the 
awkward  or  illiterate  or  misspelled  writing.  And  even  if  he  felt  certain, 
solution  often  eluded  him.  He  usually  had  only  one  message  to  work  on,  and 
no  probable  words.  Early  in  the  war,  censorship  practice  even  forbade 
working  on  a suspected  cryptogram  more  than  half  an  hour,  on  the  theory 
that  if  the  cryptanalyst  hadn’t  gotten  it  by  then,  he’d  never  get  it.  These 
unsolved  messages  posed  a difficult  problem  to  the  censors.  Presumably 
they  were  carrying  contraband  information  and  so  should  be  banned.  But, 
in  the  absence  of  solution,  no  proof  of  this  existed,  and  so  the  letter  could 
not  be  mutilated.  Sometimes  this  was  done  anyway,  to  destroy  the  suspected 
code. 

Technological  steganography  early  in  the  war  consisted  almost  exclusively 
of  invisible  inks.  This  is  truly  an  ancient  device.  Pliny  the  Elder,  in  his  Natural 
History,  written  in  the  first  century  a.d.,  told  how  the  “milk”  of  the  tithy- 
mallus  plant  could  be  used  as  a secret  ink.  Ovid  referred  to  secret  ink  in  his 
Art  of  Love.  A Greek  military  scientist,  Philo  of  Byzantium,  described  the 
use  of  a kind  of  ink  made  from  gall  nuts  (gallotannic  acid),  which  could  be 
made  visible  by  a solution  of  what  is  now  called  copper  sulfate.  Qalqashandi 
described  several  kinds  of  invisible  ink  in  his  Subh  al-a'  sha.  Alberti  mentions 
them.  The  Renaissance  employed  them  in  diplomatic  correspondence.  About 
1530  a book  was  printed  with  panels  in  invisible  ink;  if  these  pages  were 
dipped  in  water,  the  message  would  appear;  this  could  be  repeated  three  or 
four  times.  Porta  devoted  Book  XVI  of  his  Magia  Naturalis  to  invisible 
writing. 

The  common  inks  are  of  two  kinds:  organic  fluids  and  sympathetic 
chemicals.  The  former,  such  as  urine,  milk,  vinegar,  and  fruit  juices,  can  be 
charred  into  visibility  by  gentle  heating.  Despite  their  antiquity  and  their 
minimal  protection,  they  are  so  convenient  that  they  were  used  even  during 
World  War  II.  Count  Wilhelm  Albrecht  von  Rautter,  a naturalized  American 
who  was  spying  on  his  adoptive  country  for  his  native  Germany,  ran  out  of  his 
good  secret  ink  and  had  to  use  urine. 

Sympathetic  inks  are  solutions  of  chemicals  that  are  colorless  when  dry 


523 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

but  that  react  to  form  a visible  compound  when  treated  with  another  chemical, 
called  the  reagent.  For  example,  when  a spy  writes  in  iron  sulfate,  nothing  will 
be  visible  until  it  is  painted  over  with  a solution  of  potassium  cyanate,  when 
the  two  chemicals  will  combine  to  form  ferric  ferrocyanide,  or  Prussian  blue, 
a particularly  lovely  hue.  The  colorless  writing  of  lead  sub-acetate  will  turn 
into  a visible  brown  compound  when  moistened  with  sodium  sulfhydrate. 
Copper  sulfate  can  be  developed  with  ammonia  fumes,  and  it  may  have  been 
this  chemical  that  was  used  for  the  secret  writing  on  the  handkerchief  of

George  Dasch,  leader  of  the  eight  Nazi  spies  who  landed  by  submarine  on 
Long  Island  in  1942  to  blow  up  American  defense  plants,  railroad  bridges, 
and  canal  locks.  The  red  letters  that  appeared  as  if  by  magic  when  the  pungent 
ammonia  reached  it  spelled  out  the  names  and  addresses  of  a mail  drop  in 
Lisbon  and  of  two  reliable  sources  for  help  in  the  United  States.  Each  of  the 
eight  saboteurs  had  also  been  given  a watertight  tube  containing  four  or  five 
matchsticks  tipped  with  a grayish  substance  that  served  as  a ready-made 
pen-and-secret-ink.  The  trick  in  concocting  a good  secret  ink  is  to  find  a sub- 
stance that  will  react  with  the  fewest  possible  chemicals — only  one,  if  possible, 
thus  resulting  in  what  is  called  a highly  “specific”  ink. 

To  test  for  secret  inks,  censorship  stations  “striped"  letters.  The  laboratory 
assistant  drew  several  brushes,  all  wired  together  in  a holder  and  each  dipped 


524 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

in  a different  developer,  diagonally  across  the  suspected  documents.  The 
developers  were  wide-spectrum,  picking  up  even  such  substances  as  body  oils, 
so  that  fingerprints  and  sweat  drops  often  showed  up.  On  the  other  hand,  they 
missed  some  specific  inks.  A bleaching  bath  removed  the  stripes.  Letters 
were  also  checked  by  infrared  and  ultraviolet  light.  Writing  in  starch,  in- 
visible in  daylight  or  under  electric  light,  will  fluoresce  under  ultraviolet. 
Infrared  can  differentiate  colors  indistinguishable  in  ordinary  light  and  so 
can  pick  up,  for  example,  green  writing  on  a green  postage  stamp.  The  cen- 
sorship field  stations  tested  all  suspicious  letters  and  a percentage  of  ordinary 
mail  picked  at  random,  and  sometimes  all  letters  to  and  from  a certain  city  for 
a week  to  see  if  anything  suspicious  turned  up.  During  the  war,  about  4,600 
suspicious  letters  were  passed  along  to  the  F.B.I.  and  other  investigative 
agencies;  of  these  400  proved  to  be  of  some  importance. 

Problems  that  would  not  yield  to  the  crude  approach  of  the  field  stations 
went  back  to  the  T.O.D.  laboratory.  Here,  amid  Bunsen  burners  and  retorts, 
Pierce  and  Breon,  aided  by  an  expert  photographer  and  laboratory  technicians, 
cooked  up  reagents  that  would  reincarnate  the  phantom  writing.  Better 
equipped  and  more  deeply  versed  in  the  nuances  of  sympathetic  inks  than  the 
mass-production  workers  of  the  field  stations,  they  had  received  a great 
stimulus  from  contact  with  one  of  the  great  secret-ink  experts  of  the  world, 
England’s  Dr.  Stanley  W.  Collins,  who  had  conducted  this  battle  of  the 
test  tubes  in  two  World  Wars;  he  spoke  at  the  Miami  Counter-Espionage 
Conference  in  August,  1943.  T.O.D.  soon  learned  that  Nazi  spies  were 
taking  countermeasures  to  frustrate  the  iodine-vapor  test  and  the  general 
reagent. 

One  was  to  split  a piece  of  paper,  write  a secret-ink  message  on  the  inner 
surface,  then  rejoin  the  halves.  With  the  ink  on  the  inside,  no  reagent  applied  to 
the  outside  could  develop  it!  The  technique  came  to  light  when  one  German 
spy  used  too  much  ink  and  the  excess  soaked  through.  Sanborn  Brown,  the 
M.I.T.  physicist,  got  two  inmates  of  a local  jail  to  explain  how  two  sheets  of 
parchment  could  be  used  to  do  the  splitting.  They  had  been  caught  misap- 
plying the  talent  to  one-  and  ten-dollar  bills,  pasting  one  half  of  the  tens  to 
one  half  of  the  ones  and  passing  them  with  the  ten-dollar  side  up.  The  method 
is  more  an  art  than  a science,  for  if  the  sudden  tear  is  not  done  just  right,  the 
paper  will  shred.  To  read  the  message,  the  paper  must  be  resplit,  but  it  comes 
apart  much  more  easily  the  second  time. 

Another  antidetection  measure  was  transfer.  German  agents  would  write 
their  message  in  invisible  ink  on  one  sheet  of  paper,  then  press  this  tightly 
against  another  sheet.  Moisture  in  the  air  would  carry  some  of  the  ink  to  the 
second  sheet  without  the  telltale  differential  wetting  of  the  fiber  papers  on 
which  the  iodine  test  relied.  This  compelled  T.O.D.  to  find  the  specific  reagent 
required. 

Perhaps  the  most  interesting  development  of  the  secret-ink  war  was  the 
German  instrument  discovered  by  Shaw,  Pierce,  and  Richter  in  1945  and 


525 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

dubbed  the  “Wurlitzer  Organ”  because  of  its  resemblance  to  that  musical 
instrument.  They  found  a burned-out  shell  of  one  “organ”  in  the  bombed 
remnants  of  the  Munich  censorship  station,  and  an  undamaged  one  in  the 
censorship  station  on  an  upper  floor  of  the  Hamburg  post  office.  It  examined 
suspected  letters  on  an  assembly-line  basis  by  ingeniously  exploiting  some 
principles  of  physics  to  make  the  invisible  ink  glow.  It  first  exposed  the  paper 
to  ultraviolet  light.  This  pumped  energy  into  chemicals  of  the  ink,  boosting 
their  electrons  out  of  their  normal  orbits  into  higher  ones.  The  chemical  was 
then  in  a metastable  state.  The  heat  from  a source  of  infrared  then  nudged  the 
electrons  from  their  higher  orbits  back  into  their  regular  ones.  As  they  did  so, 
the  substance  would  give  up,  in  the  form  of  visible  light,  the  energy  that  it  had 
absorbed  from  the  ultraviolet.  Since  this  phenomenon  will  occur  for  nearly 
all  substances,  even  common  salt,  though  some  will  naturally  shine  more 
brightly  than  others,  the  Germans  had  a system  that  would  develop  a good 
many  inks. 

The  chief  difficulty  with  secret  inks  was  their  inability  to  handle  the  great 
volume  of  information  that  spies  had  to  transmit  in  a modern  war.  One  way  of 
channeling  large  amounts  was  to  dot  the  meaningful  letters  in  a newspaper 
with  a solution  of  anthracene  in  alcohol.  This  was  invisible  under  normal 
circumstances  but  glowed  when  exposed  to  ultraviolet  light.  But  with  news- 
papers being  carried  as  third-class  mail,  this  was  hardly  the  fastest  method  of 
getting  information  to  where  it  was  going. 

The  Germans  then  came  up  with  what  F.B.I.  Director  J.  Edgar  Hoover 
called  “the  enemy’s  masterpiece  of  espionage.”  This  was  the  microdot,  a 
photograph  the  size  of  a printed  period  that  reproduced  with  perfect  clarity  a 
standard-sized  typewritten  letter.  Though  microphotographs  (of  a lesser 
reduction)  had  carried  messages  to  beleaguered  Paris  as  far  back  as  1870,  a 
tip  to  the  F.B.I.  in  January  of  1940  by  a double  agent,  “Watch  out  for  the 
dots — lots  and  lots  of  little  dots,”  threw  the  bureau  into  a near  panic.  Agents 
feverishly  looked  everywhere  for  some  evidence  of  them,  but  it  was  not  until 
August  of  1941  that  a laboratory  technician  saw  a sudden  tiny  gleam  on  the 
surface  of  an  envelope  carried  by  a suspected  German  agent — and  carefully 
pried  off  the  first  of  the  microdots,  which  had  been  masquerading  as  a type- 
written period. 

At  first  the  microdot  process  involved  two  steps:  A first  photograph  of  an 
espionage  message  resulted  in  an  image  the  size  of  a postage  stamp;  the 
second,  made  through  a reversed  microscope,  brought  it  down  to  less  than 
0.05  inches  in  diameter.  This  negative  was  developed.  Then  the  spy  pressed  a 
hypodermic  needle,  whose  point  had  been  clipped  off  and  its  round  edge 
sharpened,  into  the  emulsion  like  a cookie  cutter  and  lifted  out  the  microdot. 
Finally  the  agent  inserted  it  into  a cover-text  over  a period  and  cemented  it 
there  with  collodion.  Later,  one  Professor  Zapp  simplified  the  process  so  that 
most  of  these  operations  could  be  performed  mechanically  in  a cabinet  the 
size  of  a dispatch  case.  The  microdots,  or  “pats,”  as  T.O.D.  called  them,  were 


526 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


photographically  fixed  but  were  not  developed;  consequently,  the  image  on 
them  remained  latent  and  the  film  itself  clear.  In  this  less  obtrusive  form  they 
were  pasted  onto  the  gummed  surface  of  envelopes,  whose  shininess  camou- 
flaged their  own.  The  pats  could  show  such  fine  detail  because  the  aniline  dye 
used  as  an  emulsion  would  resolve  images  at  the  molecular  level,  whereas 
the  silver  compounds  ordinarily  used  in  photography  resolve  only  down  to 
the  granular  level. 

The  microdots  solved  the  problem  of  quantity  flow  of  information  for  the 
Nazis.  Professor  Zapp’s  cabinets  were  shipped  to  agents  in  South  America, 
and  soon  a flood  of  material  was  being  sent  to  Germany  disguised  as  hundreds 
of  periods  in  telegraph  blanks,  love  letters,  business  communications,  family 
missives,  or  sometimes  as  a strip  of  the  tiny  film  hidden  under  a stamp.  The 
very  first  discovered,  and  the  most  frightening,  was  one  in  which  a spy  was 
asked  to  discover  “Where  are  being  made  tests  with  uranium?”  at  a time 
when  the  United  States  was  fighting  to  keep  secret  its  development  of  the 
atom  bomb.  The  “Mexican  microdot  ring,”  which  operated  from  a suburb  of 
Mexico  City,  microphotographed  trade  and  technical  publications  that  were 
barred  from  international  channels — a favorite  was  Iron  Age,  with  statistics 
on  American  steel  production — and  sent  them  to  cover  addresses  in  Europe 
on  a wholesale  basis,  with  as  many  as  twenty  pats  in  a single  letter.  Technical 
drawings  also  went  by  microdot.  Other  microdots  talked  of  blowing  up  seized 
Axis  ships  in  southern  harbors,  the  deficient  condition  of  one  of  the  Panama 
Canal  locks,  and  so  on.  Censorship  discovered  many  of  these,  now  that  it  knew 
what  to  look  for,  and  this  enabled  the  F.B.I.’s  wartime  Latin  American 
branch  to  break  up  one  Axis  spy  ring  after  another. 

With  mail  and  cable  routes  being  screened  so  closely  and  subject  to  un- 
predictable delays,  it  was  not  unlikely  that  Axis  agents  would  take  to  the  ether 
to  gain  speed  and  avoid  censorship.  But  here,  too,  the  United  States  was 
ready  for  them. 

The  Radio  Intelligence  Division  of  the  Federal  Communication  Com- 
mission had  the  job,  in  peacetime,  of  policing  the  airwaves,  which  are  public 
property,  for  violations  of  federal  radio  regulations.  During  the  war,  its  12 
primary  and  60  subordinate  monitoring  posts  and  about  90  mobile  units 
patrolled  the  radio  spectrum  for  enemy  agent  radios.  Teletype  linked  them 
into  a direction-finding  net  coordinated  from  Washington.  R.I.D.  employed 
the  latest  radio  equipment,  including  an  aperiodic  receiver  that  would  give  an 
alarm  whenever  it  picked  up  a signal  on  any  of  a wide  range  of  frequencies, 
and  the  “snifter,”  a meter  that  a man  could  carry  in  the  palm  of  his  hand 
while  inspecting  a building  to  see  which  apartment  a signal  came  from. 

In  the  routine  day-and-night  operation  of  a monitoring  station  [wrote  George 

E.  Sterling,  R.I.D.'s  chief],  the  patrolman  of  the  ether  would  cruise  his  beat, 

passing  up  and  down  the  frequencies  of  the  usable  radio  spectrum,  noting  the 


527 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

landmarks  of  the  regular  fixed  transmission,  recognizing  the  peculiar  modulation 
of  a known  transmitter  or  the  characteristic  fist  of  a familiar  operator,  observing 
an  irregularity  in  operating  procedure  and  pausing  long  enough  to  verify  the 
call  letters,  or  finding  a strange  signal  and  recording  the  traffic  for  close  exam- 
ination, and  then  sometimes  alerting  the  nation-wide  net  to  obtain  a fix  on  the 
location  of  its  source.  More  than  800  such  fixes  would  be  made  in  an  average 
month,  requiring  the  taking  of  some  6,000  individual  bearings. 

This  sort  of  efficiency,  built  up  during  the  long  prewar  years,  so  terrified 
the  Japanese  that  when  an  agent  requested  permission  to  set  up  a transmitter, 
he  was  turned  down  on  the  ground  that  the  F.C.C.  would  nab  it  as  soon  as 
he  went  on  the  air.  It  evidently  made  its  impress  on  the  Nazis  as  well,  for  only 
one  bona-fide  Axis  station  was  ever  heard  in  the  United  States.  It  was  the 
German  embassy  in  Washington  which,  using  the  call  letters  ua,  tried  to 
make  contact  with  Berlin  in  the  few  days  after  Pearl  Harbor.  They  never 
succeeded — nor  did  any  other  Nazi  agent. 

But  R.I.D.  did  not  live  up  to  its  acronym  only  within  the  United  States. 
It  insinuated  its  supersensitive  antennae  into  the  furtive  Morse  whisperings 
between  other  continents  and  thereby  made  an  unexpected  contribution  to 
the  Allied  war  effort.  This  began  even  before  Pearl  Harbor,  when  monitors  at 
Miami  heard  station  uu2  using  irregular  procedures.  R.I.D.  antennae  swung 
silently,  and  the  station  was  soon  pinpointed  in  Lisbon.  After  a month  of 
listening,  monitors  in  Pittsburgh  and  Albuquerque  finally  picked  up  its 
correspondent : station  cna  in  South  America.  Then  Lisbon  station  bx7  was 
identified  from  characteristics  of  its  signal  as  being  uu2  with  different  call 
letters,  and  a week  later  bx7’s  correspondent,  npd,  was  discovered  in  Portu- 
guese West  Africa.  Sterling’s  men  continued  monitoring  the  little  network,  and 
two  staff  members  who  had  become  interested  in  cryptanalysis,  Albert 
McIntosh  and  Abraham  Checkoway,  solved  the  transposition  cipher  in 
which  the  traffic  was  enciphered.  The  decrypted  messages  disclosed  German 
agents  in  the  neutral  colonies  and  countries  of  Africa  reporting  on  all  manner 
of  things— ship  sailings,  troop  movements,  political  conditions.  When 
McIntosh  and  Checkoway  solved  a message  from  Lisbon,  indiscreetly 
ordering  an  agent  codenamed  armando  in  Portuguese  West  Africa  to  have 
one  of  his  assistants  “deliver  letters  personally  to  Porter  Hotel,  Duas  Hacoes, 
Victoria  Street,  for  Mr.  Merckel,”  the  fate  of  the  German  ring  was  sealed. 
Several  weeks  later,  Allied  counterintelligence  cleaned  it  out. 

Following  this  demonstration  of  its  ability,  R.I.D.  was  asked  early  in  1942 
by  its  British  counterpart,  the  Radio  Security  Service,  to  cooperate  in  watching 
German  diplomatic  and  espionage  networks.  The  two  agencies  discovered 
that  many  clandestine  Nazi  transmitters  changed  call-signs  every  day  in  a 
rota  that  ran  for  a month  and  then  repeated.  They  catalogued  the  characteris- 
tics of  individual  transmitters  and  operators  so  that  they  could  be  recognized 
on  different  circuits.  Counterespionage  services  told  them  how  Nazi  radio 
spies  were  trained  in  a school  near  Hamburg,  how  each  agent  s fist  was 


528 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


recorded  to  make  radiotelegraph  forgery  by  the  Allies  that  much  more  diffi- 
cult, how  the  spies  set  up  their  suitcase-sized  transmitter-receivers  and  connec- 
ted them  to  directional  antennae  that  focused  maximum  signal  power  on 
Germany  and  minimized  dispersion.  As  the  war  in  Europe  mounted  toward 
its  climax,  R.I.D.  found  itself  monitoring  222  frequencies  used  in  clandestine 
European  traffic,  breaking  most  Axis  radio-spy  codes  and  ciphers,  and  reading 
nearly  all  the  messages  of  nearly  all  German  networks. 

Some  of  its  most  spectacular  results  came  in  Latin  America,  where  its 
interceptions  of  the  numerous  Axis  radios  enabled  the  F.B.E  to  help  local 
authorities  weed  out  these  infestations.  R.ED.  gathered  in  the  transmissions 
of  the  three  main  agent  networks  in  Brazil,  centered  on  transmitters  lir, 
cel,  and  cit.  Solutions  of  the  columnar-transposition  cryptograms  enabled 
R.ED.  to  feed  information  to  the  F.B.I.’s  wartime  Latin  American  branch; 
its  agents  then  gumshoed  these  leads  until  it  ferreted  out  the  members  of  the 
rings. 

Such  was  the  story  of  the  cit  ring.  In  April  of  1941,  Josef  Jacob  Johannes 
Starziczny,  an  engineer  who  had  been  trained  at  the  Nazi  spy  school,  arrived 
in  Rio  de  Janeiro  as  Niels  Christian  Christiansen,  smuggling  ashore  a black 
leather  bag  containing  a transmitter,  four  coding  books,  and  microfilmed 
instructions.  A month  later  cit  went  on  the  air.  It  and  two  associated  trans- 
mitters poured  quantities  of  information  into  the  ether,  mostly  directed  at  the 
Hamburg  control  station  that  used  call-sign  ald  for  this  operation  and  the 
signature  Stein  in  many  of  its  plaintext  messages.  The  information  was  usually 
of  high  quality,  and  the  agent  radios  reached  a frenzy  of  activity  early  in 
March,  1942,  when  the  liner  Queen  Mary  arrived  in  Rio  with  10,000  troops 
aboard.  Sinking  her  would  be  a tremendous  blow  to  the  Allies,  both  in  terms 
of  the  actual  loss  of  the  troops  and  the  transport  capacity  of  the  vessel  and  in 
terms  of  morale.  Because  of  her  speed,  she  traveled  without  a convoy,  and  the 
agents  in  Brazil  pounded  out  message  after  message  to  Germany  in  an 
attempt  to  enable  the  U-boat  wolf  packs  to  get  on  her  trail. 

“ Queen  Mary  arrived  here  today  at  10:00  ..  . she  must  [go]  to  cellar,” 
wirelessed  cit  on  March  6,  1942.  Two  days  later,  cel  flashed:  “ Queen  Mary 
sailed  on  March  8,  18  o’clock  local  time.”  The  next  day,  cit  tapped  out, 
“With  Queen  Mary  falls  Churchill  . . . Good  luck.”  Unknown  to  the  opera- 
tors, however,  R.I.D.  was  eavesdropping.  And  when,  on  March  13,  lir  sent  a 
slow  hand-keyed  message  on  1 1,220  kilocycles,  an  R.I.D.  operator  at  Laredo, 
Texas,  copied  it  with  ease:

From  one  of  lir’s  first  messages,  R.I.D.  had  discovered  that  the  group 
based  its  calls  and  its  transposition  cipher  on  Axel  Munthe’s  The  Story  of  San 
Michele,  using  an  edition  excluded  from  the  United  States  and  the  British 
Empire.  The  agent  determined  the  page  to  be  used  by  adding  his  personal  key- 
number  to  the  number  of  the  month  and  the  date.  The  last  line  of  that  page 
furnished  the  call  letters  that  lir  was  to  use  that  day — the  first  three  letters 
reversed  for  the  station  in  Germany  and  the  last  three  letters  reversed  for  the 
agent  post.  From  analysis  of  previous  messages,  R.I.D.  knew  that  the  lir 
operator’s  keynumber  was  56.  Added  to  3,  for  the  month,  and  13,  the  day, 
this  would  total  72.  The  last  word  on  page  72  was  “give,”  so  evi  was  the 
proper  call-sign  for  the  sender.  The  repeated  v stood  for  von  (“from”). 

The  message  had  been  sent  in  the  early  hours  of  the  13th,  but  had  actually 
been  enciphered  on  the  12th  with  the  key  for  that  date,  which  would  be  found 
on  page  71,  from  56  + 3 + 12.  The  first  line  on  this  page  began,  “I  would  have 
known  how  to  master  his  fear,”  and  R.I.D.,  like  the  agent,  assigned  numbers 
to  the  first  nine  different  letters: 

IWOULDHAV 

123456789 

This  key  deciphered  the  first  four  groups,  with  other  letters  acting  as  nulls: 

I W E O F WO  NUG  IUVBJ  DLVCP 

12  3 234  149  659 

which  meant  “12  March,  2304  hours,  149  letters,  659th  message.”  The  next 
group,  nabrs,  identified  the  agent,  and  the  149  remaining  letters  were  then 
inscribed  into  a columnar  transposition  block  in  accordance  with  a key 
derived  by  taking  the  initial  letters  of  the  first  twenty  lines  on  page  71  (skip- 
ping indented  lines)  and  forming  a numerical  key  from  them.  The  result  was:

This  single  transposition,  with  x’s  as  word-dividers,  sufficed,  and  the  text  can 
be  read  directly  from  the  tableau.  In  English,  and  without  the  repetitions:

530  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

But  all  the  German  effort  that  went  into  the  collection  and  transmission  of 
this  intelligence  was  frustrated  when  the  Queen  Mary,  perhaps  alerted  by 
these  solutions,  dashed  across  the  Atlantic,  eluding  the  submarines  and  mak- 
ing port  safely  with  her  10,000  men.  The  Queen  Mary  messages  were,  in  fact, 
the  last  the  three  Nazi  radio  rings  ever  sent.  Brazilian  police,  tipped  off  by  the 
F.B.I.  and  helped  by  an  R.I.D.  agent,  swooped  down  on  Starziczny  on  March 
10  and  on  the  other  two  rings  soon  thereafter.  Two  hundred  agents  and  sym- 
pathizers were  arrested  and  the  spy  nets  destroyed. 

The  stupidity  of  sending  a key  so  that  anyone  could  understand  it  was  not 
confined  to  lir.  The  best-organized  Nazi  espionage  apparatus  in  South 
America,  which  had  transmitted  its  messages  to  Germany  via  stations  pyl 
and  pqz  in  Chile,  was  finally  smashed  in  February  of  1944,  largely  through 
R.I.D.  and  F.B.I.  information.  Afterwards,  its  chief,  Major  Ludwig  von 
Bohlen,  set  down  his  “Experiences  Gained  from  the  Valparaiso  Process,”  and 
his  very  first  item  read:  “The  cardinal  mistake  was  the  insufficiency  of  the 
original  key,  and  the  transmission  of  the  second  key  together  with  the  first. 
If  the  communication  identification  word  had  not  been  deciphered,  the  code 
would  not  have  been  broken.” 

There  were,  however,  two  stations  communicating  with  Hamburg  which 
R.I.D.  left  undisturbed — even  though  both  were  operating  on  American  soil. 
The  first  used  the  call  cq  dx  v w2— cq  being  the  general  call  to  anyone  to 
listen,  dx  meaning  that  a long-distance  contact  was  desired,  v meaning  “from,” 
w2  being  the  prefix  assigned  to  amateur  radio  operators’  stations  in  the  sec- 
ond call  area,  which  embraced  Long  Island.  The  two  or  three  letters  that 
should  follow  the  w2  prefix  were  not  used.  This  station  began  operating  at 
6 p.m.  on  May  15,  1940,  trying  to  reach  the  Hamburg  station  on  a wave- 
length of  14,300  to  14,400  kilocycles  from  a small  house  at  Centerport,  Long 
Island.  After  several  tentative  contacts,  aor  in  Hamburg  flashed  back  on  May  3 1 
with  the  first  full-length  coded  message,  demanding  information  on  monthly 
airplane  production,  how  many  were  exported  to  all  countries,  especially 
England  and  France,  whether  they  were  delivered  by  ship  or  air,  and  whether 
payment  was  credit  or  cash  and  carry.  The  messages  were  enciphered  in  a 
transposition  cipher  like  lir’s,  keyed  on  Rachel  Field’s  best-selling  All  This, 
and  Heaven  Too.  This  seems  to  have  been  the  standard  Nazi  spy  cipher,  since 
it  was  still  being  used  in  1943  by  two  German  agents  caught  in  Newark.  The 
F.B.I.,  however,  was  able  to  read  the  Centerport  messages  without  crypt- 
analyzing them  not  because  the  G-men  were  clairvoyants  or  miracle-workers, 
but  because  they  had  made  them  up  in  the  first  place. 

The  ostensible  operator  of  the  Centerport  set  was  William  G.  Sebold,  a 
German-born  American  citizen  secretly  working  for  the  F.B.I.  When,  in  the 
summer  of  1939,  Sebold  returned  to  his  native  Mulheim  for  a visit,  the 
Gestapo  had  stolen  his  passport  and  threatened  to  harm  his  Jewish  grand- 
father unless  Sebold  promised  to  become  a spy  for  Germany  in  America. 
Sebold,  who  had  meanwhile  contacted  American  authorities  in  Cologne, 


531 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

pretended  to  agree.  After  a course  at  the  Hamburg  spy  school,  he  returned 
to  the  United  States  on  February  8,  1940,  contacted  the  Nazi  agents  whose 
names  he  had  been  given,  and  set  up  the  radio  station  to  transmit  their  in- 
formation to  Germany. 

Two  F.B.I.  agents  were  in  fact  manning  the  Centerport  set,  enciphering 
and  sending  messages  whose  contents  had  been  carefully  screened  to  include 
enough  true  information  to  seem  authentic  and  enough  false  data  to  be  mis- 
leading. At  the  same  time  other  F.B.I.  agents  were  using  the  contact  to 
build  up  evidence  against  Frederick  J.  Duquesne  and  other  Nazi  agents.  On 
June  28,  1941,  the  F.B.I.,  in  a sudden  series  of  raids,  smashed  the  largest  spy 
ring  to  be  uncovered  before  Pearl  Harbor. 

Even  more  successful  in  tricking  the  Nazis  was  the  double-agent  nd98. 
An  importer-exporter  when  the  Nazis  recruited  him  for  espionage,  he  sold 
out  to  the  Americans  as  soon  as  he  arrived  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  to 
carry  on  his  spy  activities  for  Germany.  Like  Sebold,  he  established  a radio 
station  on  Long  Island  under  F.B.I.  supervision  and  began  feeding  the  Nazis 
with  a careful  mixture  of  true  and  false  data.  For  example,  he  hinted  that  the 
United  States  planned  a major  operation  against  the  northern  Kurile  Islands 
in  the  Pacific.  In  fact  this  was  to  be  merely  a feint  for  the  real  assault,  on  the 
Marshall  Islands.  As  hoped,  Germany  relayed  the  information  to  Japan,  and 
later  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  advised  the  F.B.I.  that  nd98’s  information  may 
well  have  contributed  to  the  success  of  the  invasion  of  the  Marshalls  in 
February  of  1944.  The  Nazis  liked  nd98’s  information  so  much  that  they 
paid  him  $55,000  for  it  and  maintained  contact  with  him  from  February  20, 
1942,  when  the  first  of  hundreds  of  messages  was  sent,  right  up  to  the  very 
end  of  the  war.  They  only  stopped  communicating  on  May  2,  1945,  when  the 
Hamburg  station  was  .aptured  by  the  advancing  British. 

But  this  was  child’s  play  in  comparison  with  the  greatest  radio  deception 
of  them  all. 

The  Germans  called  it  a “Funkspiel,”  and  they  could  not  have  named  it 
better.  “Funk”  means  “radio,”  while  “Spiel”  means  “play”  or  “performance,” 
with  secondary  meanings  of  “game,”  “sport,”  and  “match.”  Even  all  these 
together  do  not  fully  express  the  connotation  of  the  German.  As  one  writer 
put  it,  “The  word  implies  a mysterious  carillon  that  rings  out  in  the 
ether,  sounding  a Lorelei  tune  to  mislead  or  entrap  men  who  listen  to 
it.” 

Director  of  the  funkspiel  that  achieved  more  spectacular  results  than  any 
other  in  World  War  II  was  Major  Herman  J.  Giskes,  46,  a Rhinelander  who 
had  spent  most  of  his  adult  life  in  the  German  Army.  Giskes  was  chief  of  the 
Netherlands  branch  of  Section  III  F (counterespionage)  of  the  Abwehr,  but 
though  the  Abwehr  had  its  own  efficient  mobile  radio-intelligence  units, 
Giskes  came  to  use  the  radio-intelligence  section  of  the  Ordnungspolizei,  an 
occupation  police  force,  for  this  funkspiel. 


532 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  Germans  began  tugging  on  the  rope  of  the  great  carillon  when  they 
recruited  a bloated,  lame,  perspiring  Dutchman  named  George  Ridderhof  as 
a V-man.  The  V-men,  posing  as  patriots,  wormed  into  the  Dutch  underground 
and  fed  information  to  the  Nazis.  For  a few  months,  Ridderhof,  who  was 
called  f2078  by  Giskes,  registered  little  progress  in  his  reports  as  he  sought 
to  gain  the  confidence  of  a cluster  of  Dutch  agents  working  in  The 
Hague. 

Meanwhile,  the  Abwehr  radio-intelligence  units  had  been  intercepting  and 
solving  messages  sent  five  times  a week  from  an  underground  transmitter  with 
call  letters  ubx.  Gradually  the  direction-finders  closed  in,  and  suddenly, 
at  8 o’clock  one  morning,  ubx  was  raided.  Captured  were  the  operator, 
his  assistant,  their  ciphering  material,  the  transmitter,  and  espionage 
material. 

This  was  Section  IIIF’s  first  major  success  in  Holland,  and  Giskes  im- 
mediately began  bending  his  thoughts  to  see  whether  ubx  could  be  “played 
back”  in  a funkspiel.  The  advantages  of  a funkspiel  are  great.  With  the  Ger- 
mans operating  a radio  set  that  the  Allies  believed  to  be  still  in  the  hands  of 
the  underground,  the  Abwehr  would  be  able  to  learn  a great  deal  about  enemy 
intentions  from  instructions  sent  out  by  London.  It  could  exploit  this  in- 
formation to  frustrate  Allied  military  excursions  and  to  break  up  other 
Resistance  groups.  It  could  lace  Allied  intelligence  with  false  information  in 
the  expectation  that  when  plans  based  on  this  data  miscarried  Allied  com- 
manders would  lose  confidence  in  their  intelligence.  A funkspiel  works  in 
the  ether  precisely  as  a double-agent  does  in  person.  Because  of  its  value,  the 
Abwehr  subordinated  all  other  considerations  to  the  possibility  of  reversing 
a Resistance  station.  The  underground,  on  its  part,  was  well  aware  of  the 
danger  of  a funkspiel,  and,  to  discourage  the  Germans,  would  booby-trap 
doors  and  radios  and  leave  half-emptied  bottles  of  poisoned  brandy  standing 
about. 

But  ubx  was  not  reversed.  Some  details  necessary  to  make  the  playback 
sound  authentic  were  missing,  and  the  operator  refused  to  divulge  them  under 
interrogation.  Two  other  afus — as  the  Germans  sometimes  dubbed  the  agent 
radios,  from  their  own  highly  compact  but  powerful  clandestine  transmitter— 
were  captured,  but  attempts  at  reversing  them  also  failed.  These  failures 
whetted  Giskes’  appetite  for  a success. 

The  possibility  of  one  began  glimmering  in  January,  1942.  Ridderhof 
reported  that  the  network  that  he  had  penetrated  was  about  to  receive  equip- 
ment from  Britain  via  a parachute  drop  that  had  been  arranged  by  radio.  “Go 
to  the  North  Pole  with  your  stories,”  Giskes  wrote  angrily  on  the  report. 
“There  is  no  radio  communication  between  Holland  and  England.”  A few 
days  later,  however,  the  FuB,  or  intercept  station,  of  the  Ordnungspolizei 
heard  a new  radio  link  between  station  rls  in  south  Holland  and  ptx  in 
England,  north  of  London— a location  that  communicated  with  many  of 
Europe’s  underground  radio  stations.  Ridderhof  confirmed  that  his  network 


533 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

was  operating  rls,  and  his  Abwehr  contact  man,  in  reporting  this  to  Giskes, 
referred  slyly  to  “Operation  North  Pole.”  Giskes  laughed,  and  Funkspiel 
nordpol  got  its  name.* 

Close  surveillance  of  rls  began  at  once.  The  FuB  soon  established  its 
transmission  routine,  and  direction-finding  pinpointed  the  afu  in  an  apart- 
ment house  on  Fahrenheitstraat,  The  Hague.  Ridderhof  dribbled  information 
into  the  net,  items  both  false  and  true,  one  of  which,  for  example,  confirmed 
that  the  cruiser  Prinz  Eugen  was  undergoing  repair  at  Scheidam.  Within  a 
month,  Section  III  F had  gained  enough  knowledge  of  rls  to  attempt  a 
funkspiel.  A raid  was  set  for  the  next  regular  transmission  period,  with  a vir- 
tually simultaneous  roundup  of  the  other  agents,  as  much  to  keep  them  from 
disclosing  the  funkspiel  as  to  quash  the  network. 

At  6 p.m.  Friday,  March  6,  1942,  four  disguised  police  cars  blocked  off 
Fahrenheitstraat.  In  the  back  seat  of  one,  a man  in  plain  clothes  heard  the 
key-clicks  of  a nearby  transmitter  as  he  sought  the  exact  frequency,  rls  was 
trying  to  raise  London.  Giskes  planned  to  burst  in  before  the  radio  operator 
made  contact,  to  prevent  his  warning  London.  But  the  operator,  tipped  off 
by  the  owner  of  the  apartment  house  that  several  cars  filled  with  men  were 
outside,  broke  off  his  transmission,  gathered  his  three  enciphered  messages, 
and  fled.  He  was  apprehended  a few  yards  away,  and  the  police,  breaking  into 
the  flat,  discovered  a small  trunk,  with  the  radio  set  and  various  papers  in  it, 
resting  across  two  lines  of  washing  in  the  rear  garden,  where  the  wife  of  the 
apartment  house  owner  had  dropped  it. 

The  cat-and-mouse  game  now  began.  The  radioman,  Hubertus  M.  G. 
Lauwers,  had  been  prepared  for  just  such  a situation  in  the  spy  school  he  had 
attended  while  training  in  England  as  an  underground  agent.  The  Nazis,  he 
had  been  told,  would  try,  first  through  persuasion  and  then  through  torture, 
to  win  the  cooperation  of  the  radioman  on  the  key  so  that  no  change  of  fist 
would  become  apparent  to  England.  And  since  it  was  desirable  for  an  agent 
to  avoid  torture,  to  prevent  his  spilling  really  important  secrets,  such  as  names 
of  other  members  of  the  ring,  the  agent  was  directed  to  pretend  to  cooperate — 
warning  England,  however,  that  he  had  been  captured  and  his  radio  com- 
promised. He  was  to  sound  a silent  alarm  by  omitting  his  security  check  from 
his  compromised  transmissions. 

* The  R.S.H.A.,  whose  Section  IV  E was  charged  with  domestic  counterespionage  and 
frequently  clashed  with  the  Abwehr's  Section  III  F over  their  differing  views  of  their  almost 
indistinguishable  responsibilities,  called  it  the  englandspiel,  the  name  by  which  it  is 
perhaps  more  widely  known.  The  R.S.H.A.  felt  it  more  important  to  uproot  an  underground 
network  than  to  play  back  its  afu  and  this  led  to  several  conflicts  with  the  Abwehr.  Giskes 
finally  agreed  with  his  opposite  number  in  Section  IV  E-Netherlands,  Sturmbannfiihrer 
Joseph  Schreieder,  that  the  Abwehr  would  handle  matters  in  the  ether  while  the  R.S.H.A. 
would  make  arrests  on  the  ground.  The  rivalry  between  the  two,  which  hampered  German 
counterespionage,  reflected  the  high-level  power  struggle  between  Himmler,  the  R.S.H.A. 
overseer,  and  Admiral  Wilhelm  Canaris,  chief  of  the  Abwehr,  which  Himmler  eventually 
won  when  the  R.S.H.A.  absorbed  the  Abwehr. 


534 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  security  check  was  an  authenticator  that  the  agent  was  to  include  in 
every  one  of  his  messages  to  prove  their  validity.  It  might  consist  of  a number 
group,  inserted  at  a prearranged  point  in  the  ciphertext,  that  had  been  ob- 
tained by  adding  together  the  date  and  a special  number  belonging  to  that 
agent  alone.  It  might  consist  of  the  insertion  of  an  x after  every  tenth  letter  of 
plaintext.  It  could  take  many  forms.  When  a message  came  in  without  this 
check,  or  with  what  appeared  to  be  a wrong  security  check  (for  the  Germans 
could  be  expected  to  be  as  familiar  with  the  technique  as  the  Allies),  a tocsin 
was  to  ring  in  London. 

Then  the  Allies  would  be  able  to  funkspiel  a funkspiel.  While  the  Germans 
thought  that  they  were  tricking  London,  feeding  it  false  information  and 
milking  it  of  true,  London  would  have  turned  the  tables  on  them  and  engorged 
the  Germans  on  false  data  while  deducing,  by  contradiction,  the  Germans’  real 
plans  from  the  phony  ones  they  sent  London.  And  the  Abwehr’s  respect  for 
funkspiel  information  as  being  especially  accurate  and  valuable  promised  the 
Allies  commensurate  rewards  for  contaminating  it.  This  outfoxing  of  the 
foxes,  this  reversing  of  a reversed  radio  and  double-crossing  a double-crosser 
— all  these  spymasters’  dreams  of  glory  entered  the  realm  of  possibility  with 
the  recognition  of  the  missing  security  check. 

Thus,  so  long  as  the  true  check  was  kept  secret,  Lauwers  had  little  to  fear, 
and  even  much  to  gain,  from  disclosing  his  method  of  operation.  And,  as  he 
had  been  told  in  security  school,  the  Nazi  soft-sell  began  first,  starting  even 
before  he  had  been  taken  from  the  Fahrenheitstraat.  The  head  of  the  FuB 
unit,  Lieutenant  Heinrichs,  stated  that  he  could  cryptanalyze  the  three  mes- 
sages found  on  Lauwers.  However,  Lauwers  recalled,  “He  wanted  to  give  me 
an  opportunity  of  saving  my  skin  by  handing  over  the  particulars  of  my  code 
voluntarily,  and  he  added  that  I could  save  him  a lot  of  trouble  by  doing  this. 
To  me  it  seemed  reasonable  to  meet  this  proposal,  and  I promised  that  I would 
fall  in  with  his  wish  if  he  were  to  succeed  in  deciphering  one  of  the  three 
messages  which  had  been  found  on  me.  To  my  surprise  he  agreed  at  once.  He 
sat  down  at  a table,  seemingly  immersed  in  his  ‘game  of  patience,’  and  after 
about  twenty  minutes  declared  triumphantly,  ‘I  see — the  cruiser  Prinz  Eugen 
is  lying  at  Schiedam — eh  ?’  ” This  was  the  message  that  Ridderhof  had  planted 
and  that  Heinrichs  had  used  as  a crib  to  crack  the  system. 

Lauwers,  astounded  at  this  demonstration  of  omniscience,  kept  his  word  to 
hand  over  the  details  of  the  cipher,  which  consisted  of  a double  transposition 
with  a group  of  nulls  at  the  head  and  tail.  He  kept  silent  about  his  security 
check,  however,  until  Giskes  shocked  him  at  the  end  of  one  interrogation  by 
asking,  “And  what  kind  of  mistake  do  you  have  to  make?”  For  Lauwers’ 
security  check  consisted  precisely  in  making  a deliberate  error  in  the  sixteenth 
letter  of  the  plaintext.  The  error  had  to  be  one  that  could  not  occur  by  the 
accidental  addition  or  omission  of  a single  dot  or  dash  in  the  letter’s  Inter- 
national Morse  equivalent.  Thus,  an  j ( • • • ) was  not  to  be  transformed  to  an 
/(••)  or  an  /!(••••  ),  but  to,  say,  a t (-).

As  it  happened,  however,  the  sixteenth  letter  in  two  of  the  three  captured 

messages  was  the  o of  stop.  Lauwers  had  accordingly  changed  one  o ( ) 

to  an  i ( ■ • ) and  the  other  into  an  e ( • ).  This  fortunate  coincidence  enabled 
him  to  produce  a false  security  check  that  agreed  with  what  Giskes  appeared 
to  know.  He  told  the  Germans  that  his  security  check  consisted  of  changing 
the  word  stop  once  in  every  message  into  step  or  stip.  The  Germans  accepted 
this,*  and  Lauwers  agreed  to  work  the  rls  transmitter  for  them,  contriving 
to  do  the  enciphering  himself  to  perpetuate  the  false  security  check.  He  was 
confident  that  the  Dutch  section  of  Special  Operations  Executive,  the  British 
organization  that  managed  underground  activities  in  Europe,  would  spot  the 
warning  and  take  the  proper  measures. 

The  first  regular  transmission  period  after  the  capture  on  March  6 came 
at  2 p.m.  on  March  12,  and  Lauwers  sent  the  messages  that  he  had  not  sent 
the  night  of  the  raid,  which,  of  course,  had  the  correct  security  check  but  also 
the  information  he  was  going  to  send  anyway.  In  subsequent  messages,  rls, 
directed  by  Giskes,  asked  that  the  drop  point  for  an  already  arranged  para- 
chute drop  be  shifted  from  near  Zoutkamp,  which  rls  now  said  was  too 
isolated,  to  a moor  near  Steenwijk.  On  the  25th,  S.O.E.  acquiesced  and,  two 
days  later,  broadcast  the  signal  for  the  drop  itself.  This  was  the  crucial  test. 
S.O.E. ’s  own  security  check  and  encipherment  details  seemed  to  be  all  right, 
but  perhaps  S.O.E.  was  itself  planning  a trap.  Would  the  plane  deliver  bombs 
instead  of  supplies,  blowing  up  not  only  the  Abwehr’s  hopes  for  a funkspiel 
but  also  part  of  the  Abwehr  itself?  Lauwers,  who  expected  that  S.O.E. 
would  detect  his  false  security  check,  hoped  so.  Giskes,  though  unaware  of 
Lauwers’  silent  alarm,  could  nevertheless  not  be  absolutely  confident  of 
success. 

On  the  27th,  Giskes  and  the  German  team  huddled  in  the  juniper  bushes 
on  the  moor,  and  soon  after  midnight  they  heard  the  drone  of  aircraft  engines. 
The  plane  headed  for  the  triangle  of  red  and  white  lights  that  the  Germans 
shone  upwards,  and  suddenly  in  its  wake  five  large  black  shadows  blossomed 
and  rushed  earthward.  From  the  parachutes  swung  heavy  black  containers, 
which  hit  the  ground  with  a dull  thud.  The  plane  blinked  its  navigation  lights 
and  disappeared  westward  into  the  mist.  The  Germans,  scarcely  able  to 
believe  their  luck,  pressed  one  another’s  hands  in  dumb  joy.  The  first  of 
many  echoes  had  come  back  from  the  pealing  of  the  great  carillon. 

And  the  security  check?  Why  had  its  alarm  not  gone  off?  Because  of 
stupidity  and  incompetence  within  S.O.E.,  with  a single  factual  condition  as 
an  alibi.  This  condition  was  the  weakness  of  the  agents’  radios  and  the  agents’ 
poor  abilities  as  operators.  Consequently,  messages  seldom  arrived  with  per- 
fect accuracy.  In  some  cases,  the  decipherers  in  the  Dutch  section  of  S.O.E. 
could  not  tell  whether  an  error  was  a deliberate  one  to  conform  to  the 

* Apparently  they  never  noticed  that  neither  the  third  captured  message  nor  the  pre- 
viously intercepted  ones  fitted  this  pattern,  or  perhaps  they  thought  that  Lauwers  had  made 
some  errors.

security  check  or  just  an  ordinary  garble.  From  5 to  15  per  cent  of  the  mes- 
sages were  so  unclear  that  the  decipherers  were  happy  if  they  could  just  read 
the  text — with  these,  they  were  not  concerned  with  security  checks.  But  even 
granted  this,  the  negligence  of  S.O.E.  bordered  on  the  criminal.  The  vast 
majority  of  messages  in  which  there  was  no  question  but  that  the  crucial 
security  check  was  missing  were  regarded  as  bona  fide  by  the  organization. 
Some  messages  were  even  marked  “Identity  check  [same  as  security  check] 
omitted’’;  S.O.E.  did  not  reject  them.  Thus,  by  disregarding  the  precautions 
which  it  had  itself  instituted,  S.O.E.  fell  headlong  into  a funkspiel. 

nordpol’s  first  success  was  followed  by  others.  A succession  of  air  drops 
took  place,  each  one  increasing  Giskes’  confidence  in  the  success  of  his  funk- 
spiel.  Then,  at  the  beginning  of  May,  1942,  a series  of  Resistance  mishaps, 
skillfully  exploited  by  the  Germans,  delivered  into  their  hands  the  radio 
links,  and  hence  the  control,  of  all  underground  networks  in  Holland.  Two 
two-man  rings,  called  turnip  and  heck  by  the  S.O.E.,  had  been  parachuted 
into  Holland ; their  radios  had  been  damaged  in  the  drop,  and  they  contacted 
group  lettuce  to  report  their  problems  to  London.  Meanwhile,  the  nordpol 
group,  which  was  known  as  ebenezer  to  S.O.E.,  was  directed  to  contact 
lettuce  to  help  an  agent  of  still  another  ring,  potato.  The  Nazis  rounded  up 
these  agents  before  they  could  warn  London,  and  on  May  5,  Giskes  began 
operating  the  lettuce  transmitter  in  a second  funkspiel.  In  this  one,  a captured 
agent,  Hendrik  Jordaan,  betrayed  his  security  check. 

Eventually  the  Giskes-Schreieder  combine  was  running  fourteen  funk- 
spiels  with  S.O.E.  Hitler  himself  was  regularly  reading  reports  on  it  that  gave 
the  texts  of  many  of  the  messages;  these  were  submitted  by  Himmler.  The 
all-important  security  check  continued  to  be  omitted  from  many  of  the  trans- 
missions—Lauwers  alone  transmitted  checkless  messages  for  seven  months. 
S.O.E.  actually  bestirred  itself  a few  times  to  wonder  whether  the  Dutch 
operations  had  been  penetrated  and  should  therefore  be  terminated.  Each 
time  it  decided  to  continue  them  because  it  felt  that  the  security  checks  were 
“inconclusive  as  a test.”  The  full  scale  of  the  Dutch  section’s  bungling  is  dis- 
played in  the  fact  that  the  fourteen  transmitters  were  operated  by  only  six 
FuB  radiomen,  who  were  so  overworked  that  Giskes  sought  to  eliminate 
some  sets  by  reporting  that  they  had  been  knocked  out  by  German  action. 
S.O.E.  had  obviously  either  never  recorded  its  agents’  fists  before  sending 
them  out  or  never  bothered  to  check  their  supposed  transmissions  against  any 
transcriptions  that  they  might  have  made.  On  the  other  hand,  many  of  the 
messages  did  have  the  correct  security  check.  Credit  for  much  of  the  authen- 
ticity of  many  of  these  messages  must  go  to  Schreieder’s  cryptologic  specialist, 
Ernst  Georg  May,  a corpulent,  crew-cut  Prussian  in  his  late  thirties,  who 
thoroughly  studied  the  Resistance  cipher  systems  and  the  recurrent  “mistakes” 
therein. 

Keeping  nordpol  going  involved  a good  deal  more  than  thinking  up  fairy 
tales  to  put  on  the  air.  What  was  to  be  done  about  orders  received  from  S.O.E.? 


537 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

How  could  the  Abwehr  maintain  S.O.E.’s  confidence  that  its  underground 
networks  were  all  operating  healthily  ? Giskes  resorted  to  a variety  of  elabor- 
ate charades,  excuses,  and,  in  a few  cases,  actual  aids  to  the  Allies.  Most  of 
the  latter  involved  helping  downed  airmen  escape  to  Spain.  When  these 
reached  England,  they  extolled  the  help  given  them  by  golf,  one  of  the  Dutch 
Resistance  groups.  They  never  realized  that  golf’s  extraordinary  success  was 
due  to  its  direction  by  a German  officer,  and  S.O.E.,  confronted  by  proof 
positive  of  golf’s  efficacy  in  the  form  of  living  Allied  airmen,  suspected 
nothing.  In  another  case,  when  S.O.E.  ordered  ebenezer  to  blow  up  an 
Occupation  antenna  complex,  Giskes  reported  that  a minefield  had  thwarted 
their  attempt.  S.O.E.  accepted  the  excuse,  saying  that  the  defense  was  unfore- 
seeable. When  one  new  agent  parachuted  into  Holland  and  found  himself  in 
the  Abwehr’s  arms,  he  told  his  captors  that  unless  he  sent  the  code  message 
the  express  left  on  time  by  11  a.m.  S.O.E.  would  know  that  he  had  been 
nabbed.  Giskes,  thinking  fast,  signaled  London  through  another  funkspiel  that 
the  agent  had  landed  heavily  and  was  unconscious.  Four  days  later,  S.O.E. 
was  told  that  he  had  died  without  gaining  consciousness.  Giskes  even  went  so 
far  as  to  sabotage  a barge  in  Rotterdam  harbor  before  an  audience  of  thou- 
sands of  cheering  Dutchmen — and  then,  after  reporting  it  as  a Resistance 
coup,  planted  stories  in  the  German-controlled  newspapers  in  the  hope  that 
they  would  get  to  England  and  corroborate  his  reports. 

Lauwers,  on  the  other  hand,  was  going  frantic.  After  thinking  at  first  that 
London  had  reversed  the  Abwehr  radio,  he  finally  realized  that  there  had 
been  a serious  slip,  and  he  began  to  look  for  other  means  of  alerting  S.O.E. 
He  first  sent  the  word  caught  by  altering  the  Morse  equivalents  of  the  radio- 
man’s standard  Q-code  signal  qru  ( ••-),  meaning  “I  have  nothing 

further  for  you,”  to  cau  ( - • - ■ ■ - • ■ - ),  and  the  Morse  of  his  call-sign, 
which  he  himself  could  select  and  which  followed  qru,  to  ght.  Though  he 
slipped  this  past  the  German  operators,  developments  gave  no  indication 
that  London  had  recognized  the  cue.  He  then  tried  to  spell  out  caught  by 
altering  a likely  five-letter  ciphertext  group  and  adding  on  the  single  dash  for 
a t;  to  increase  the  chance  of  a suitable  group  appearing,  he  used  c,  G,  and  h 
almost  exclusively  as  his  nulls.  He  then  transmitted  caught  as  if  it  were  an 
error,  repeating  this  error  several  times  in  pretended  self-irritation  so  that  it 
would  be  picked  up  several  times  in  England,  and  finally  sending  the  text 
correctly.  No  response. 

With  agents  falling  like  flies  into  the  hands  of  the  Nazis,  Lauwers  and  his 
cellmate,  Jordaan,  the  operator  who  had  betrayed  his  check,  determined  to 
try  once  more  with  a scheme  that  was  more  difficult  but  that  might  show  up 
more  clearly  in  England.  They  would  make  a warning  message  out  of  the 
nulls  at  the  head  and  tail  of  two  messages.  The  Germans  prohibited  the  use  of 
vowels  in  the  nulls  at  the  head  and  tail  of  their  plaintexts,  so  the  Dutchmen 
had  to  use  consonants  in  place  of  the  vowels  of  their  clandestine  message, 
follow  these  consonants  through  the  two  transposition  blocks,  mentally 


538 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


reconvert  them  to  vowels  in  the  cryptogram,  and  then  transmit  these  vowels 
as  if  they  were  errors  for  the  consonants.  The  two  practiced  this  difficult  pro- 
cess in  their  cell  and  managed  to  pass  the  first  part  of  their  message.  But  then 
Giskes  changed  procedure:  a German  operator  read  the  cryptogram  off 
letter  by  letter,  perhaps  to  prevent  just  such  tricks,  and  the  second  half  was 
never  sent.  It  probably  didn’t  matter  anyway:  the  first  part  went  unheeded. 

As  a result,  Giskes  managed  to  keep  nordpol  going  effectively  for  the  un- 
precedented period  of  twenty  months.  No  other  funkspiel  had  ever  lasted  more 
than  three.  Agent  after  agent  parachuted  into  captivity.  The  beginning  of  the 
end  came  when  two  agents  escaped  from  the  prison  at  Haaren  and  made  their 
way  to  Dutch  authorities  in  Switzerland,  where  they  told  the  story.  Even  then 
the  resourceful  Giskes  staved  off  defeat  by  smearing  them  through  a nordpol 
link  as  having  escaped  with  German  aid  to  infiltrate  S.O.E.  But  with  the 
escape  of  three  more  agents  on  November  23,  1943,  the  radio  game  was 
finally  over.  Giskes  realized  this  when  the  messages  from  England,  usually 
packed  with  information,  came  in  leached  of  anything  solid. 

nordpol  dragged  on  for  a few  more  months  as  both  sides  fenced  for  ad- 
vantage by  sending  meaningless  messages,  until  the  Abwehr  decided  to  end 
the  pointless  exercise.  Giskes  thereupon  composed  a plaintext  message  to  be 
sent  to  the  men  heading  the  Dutch  section  of  S.O.E. 

To  Messrs.  Blunt,  Bingham  & Co.,  Successors  Ltd.,  London.  We  understand 
that  you  have  been  endeavoring  for  some  time  to  do  business  in  Holland  without 
our  assistance.  We  regret  this  the  more  since  we  have  acted  for  so  long  as  your 
sole  representatives  in  this  country,  to  our  mutual  satisfaction.  Nevertheless  we 
can  assure  you  that,  should  you  be  thinking  of  paying  us  a visit  on  the  Continent 
on  any  extensive  scale,  we  shall  give  your  emissaries  the  same  attention  as  we 
have  hitherto,  and  a similarly  warm  welcome.  Hoping  to  see  you. 

With  malice  aforethought,  Giskes  ordered  it  passed  on  April  1,  1944.  All 
ten  remaining  funkspiel  links  sent  it;  four  British  stations  receipted  for  it  as 
usual;  six  did  not  answer  the  calls.  More  than  two  years  after  it  had  begun, 
nordpol  finally  ended. 

It  had  arranged  for  190  parachute  drops  and  received  95  of  them,  contain- 
ing 30,000  pounds  of  explosives,  3,000  Sten  guns,  5,000  revolvers,  2,000  hand 
grenades,  75  radio  transmitters,  500,000  cartridges,  and  half  a million  Dutch 
guilders  in  cash — all  of  which  had  fallen  into  German  hands.  It  had  captured 
54  agents,  47  of  whom  were  shot  without  trial  that  autumn  at  the  Mauthausen 
concentration  camp.  The  great  nordpol  carillon  tolled  not  only  their 
deaths,  but  those  of  the  hopes  of  the  Allies  to  establish  a viable  underground 
in  Holland.  It  had  kept  German  defenses  in  the  Netherlands  intact  and  un- 
troubled by  saboteurs,  and  had  deceived  the  Allies  as  to  the  capabilities  of 
German  forces  there;  The  Hague  was  not  liberated  until  an  amazing  seven 
months  after  D-Day. 

It  was  the  worst  Allied  defeat  in  the  espionage  war.

That  clandestine  struggle  bred  a surprising  variety  of  systems  of  clandes- 
tine communication.  Perhaps  the  most  common  one  was  double  transposition. 
Like  the  Dutch  Resistance  groups,  the  French  Maquis  often  used  it.  A group 
led  by  Gilbert  Renault  picked  a key  from  15  to  20  letters  long  at  random  from 
a book  held  both  by  the  group  and  its  London  radio  correspondents.  The 
same  key  served  for  both  transpositions.  About  half  a dozen  nulls  began  and 
ended  each  plaintext;  the  security  check  often  involved  inserting  a specified 
letter  among  these.  The  encipherer  told  London  what  passage  had  been  used 
as  the  key  by  a series  of  numbers.  For  example,  05702  01837  would  mean 
page  57,  line  2,  with  18  letters  taken  from  that  line  to  generate  the  numerical 
transposition  key,  and  with  the  message  text  37  groups  long.  The  encipherer 
then  added  his  personal  keynumber  to  these  digits,  converted  them  into  two 
groups  of  five  letters  by  a homophonic  substitution,  converted  them  a 
second  time  into  two  other  groups  of  five  letters  in  case  the  first  pair  was 
garbled  in  transmission,  placed  them  at  prearranged  places  in  the  message, 
and  gave  it  to  his  radio  operator. 

Renault’s  network  used  this  system  from  August,  1940,  to  the  summer  of 

1943,  when,  while  in  London,  he  compiled  a code  of  five-letter  groups 
representing  whole  phrases  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  his  dangerously  long 
radio  transmissions.  He  drew  his  vocabulary  from  a study  of  a commercial 
code  and  his  network’s  messages.  He  had  planned  to  encipher  the  codetext 
by  double  transposition,  but  an  elderly  English  cryptologist  with  bulging 
eyes,  glasses  on  the  end  of  his  nose,  and  a gold  chain  across  his  vest  advised 
him  to  change  his  five-letter  groups  to  five-digit  ones  so  that  they  could  be 
enciphered  by  one-time  pads,  which  London  produced  by  machine  and  would 
give  him.  The  destruction  of  each  sheet  after  use  would  prevent  the  Nazis 
from  reading  his  back  intercepts  even  if  the  unused  portion  of  the  pad 
were  captured.  Renault  took  the  advice.  Back  in  France,  he  had  the  satis- 
faction not  only  of  seeing  his  transmission  times  drop  from  half  an  hour 
to  five  minutes  but  of  knowing  that  his  cryptograms  were  perfectly 
secure. 

Agents  of  the  American  Office  of  Strategic  Services  also  used  double 
transposition.  They  often  keyed  their  messages  with  their  school  songs,  using 
lines  1 and  2 as  keys  for  the  first  message,  lines  1 and  3 for  the  second,  and 
so  on,  to  prevent  the  multiple  anagramming  of  two  messages  with  identical 
keys.  One  agent,  Peter  Tompkins,  who  at  23  was  slipped  into  Rome  in  January, 

1944,  to  organize  a spy  ring,  employed  as  keys  two  passages  from  Dante  that 
he  had  memorized  but  could  easily  obtain  anywhere  in  Italy  if  they  slipped 
his  mind.  Nulls  were  sprinkled  about  freely.  Interestingly,  O.S.S.  did  not  use 
a security  check,  but  relied  instead  on  “electronic  fingerprinting  tape- 
recording  an  agent’s  fist  before  he  went  into  the  field.  Double  transposition 
was  simple  and  quite  secure,  but  it  was  occasionally  solved.  A contributory 
reason  may  have  been  such  practices  as  that  of  the  Resistance  group  code- 
named  marco  polo,  which  time  after  time  used  the  word  tobacco  as  a group

of  nulls  in  its  transposition  blocks  in  (successful)  attempts  to  get  the  British 
to  supply  that  necessity  in  their  parachute  drops. 

The  O.S.S.  employed  a variety  of  other  cryptographic  systems  for  inter- 
communication among  its  branches  in  London,  Chungking,  Karachi,  Burma, 
North  Africa,  and  other  places  around  the  world.  It  had  one-time  pads,  with 
random  numbers  generated  by  l.B.M.  machines,  sigabas,  which  it  called 
“Berthas,”  m-209s,  and  strips.  Its  headquarters  message  center  was  in  the 
basement  of  the  O.S.S.  administration  building  at  26th  and  E streets.  North 
West,  in  Washington,  and  was  run  by  New  York  socialite  lawyer  John  W. 
Delafield.  It  included  a specialist  department  of  five  or  six  men,  headed  by 
bridge  expert  Alfred  Sheinwold,  whose  task  it  was  to  untangle  badly  garbled 
messages,  to  make  sure  that  O.S.S.  ciphers  were  secure  and  that  keys  were  not 
being  used  too  long,  and  to  train  cryptographers  for  the  branches. 

Individual  agents  sometimes  developed  systems  of  their  own  for  special- 
purpose  use  within  the  networks  of  spies  that  they  recruited.  In  Rome,  for 
example,  Peter  Tompkins  employed  a Vigenere  with  a tableau  based  on  the  21- 
letter  Italian  alphabet  ( j,  k,  w,  x,  y omitted);  one  keyphrase  was  AVANT1 
TORINO.  Another  was  a one-page  code  of  five-letter  groups  for  communica- 
tion with  a group  in  the  mountains  near  Visso  whose  radio  signal  was  very 
weak;  the  codegroups  were  so  designed  that  if  either  the  first  or  the  last  letter 
(which  were  the  same)  and  any  of  the  intervening  three  letters  were  received 
correctly  in  proper  position,  the  group  was  known  unequivocally.  Thus,  in  the 
weather  section,  the  first  three  groups  were  sereno  (“clear”)  = tabct,  pioggia 
(“rain”)  = tbcdt,  nebbia  (“fog”)  = tcdet. 

The  governments-in-exile,  who  abhorred  any  semblance  of  collaboration 
with  the  Nazis  and  who  directed  their  resistance  from  their  headquarters  in 
London,  received  information  from  the  legations  they  maintained  in  neutral 
and  Allied  capitals.  The  Czech  counselor  in  Stockholm,  Dr.  Vladimir  Vanek, 
sent  about  500  messages  to  his  chief  between  August,  1941,  and  March,  1942, 
when  the  Swedes  arrested  him  on  espionage  charges,  probably  under  German 
pressure.  Vanek’s  messages,  sent  to  the  cable  address  minimise  London  through 
the  British  embassy,  were  enciphered  in  a combined  transposition-substitution 
system.  It  began  with  a monalphabetic  substitution  into  a numerical  alpha- 
bet whose  first  digit  always  matched  the  date.  Thus,  for  the  8th  of  the  month, 
the  alphabet  was  this,  with  the  * used  as  a word-divider:

The  transposition  keys  were  derived  from  one  of  the  bibles  of  Czech 
nationalism,  Tomas  Masaryk’s  Svetova  Revoluce.  (His  son,  incidentally,  who 
was  Foreign  Minister  of  the  Czech  government-in-exile,  was  the  recipient  of 


541 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

many  messages  keyed  through  his  father’s  book.)  The  pages  used  were  selected 
apparently  at  random;  page  74  for  August,  page  391  for  September,  25  for 
October,  and  so  on.  For  the  8th  of  September,  the  eighth  line  on  the  page 
would  be  taken.  The  first  18  letters  of  the  line— “pakani  profesors  tvi . . . ” — 
bred  a numerical  key  for  a transposition  block  for  the  substitution.  The  result 
of  this  transposition  was  inscribed  into  a second  block  whose  key  was  derived 
from  the  last  19  letters  of  the  same  line  (“politicky  aneskodilo  . . . ”).  The 
plaintext  sent  by  Vanek  on  that  date  was;  Sudar.Pachatel*atentatu*na* 

nem.Municni*v/aky*ve*svedsku*je*nemecky*konsul*v*malmoe*nolde . Mame* 

duverne*od*noru.Jlnas37,  plus  0 as  a null.  The  ciphertext  began:  34232  21333 
19293  11121  33020  10121 

Sweden’s  Arne  Beurling  solved  it  when  he  saw  “a  shadow  of  the  system” 
in  the  cryptograms.  He  noticed  that  0’s,  l's,  2’s,  and  3’s,  which  stood  out 
because  of  their  much  greater  frequency,  appeared  at  approximately  regular 
intervals  in  the  cryptograms.  He  deduced  that  this  resulted  from  a preliminary 
encipherment  in  an  alphabet  of  the  type  actually  used,  followed  by  a first 
inscription  into  a transposition  block  with  an  even  number  of  columns.  This 
would  columnize  all  the  0’s,  l’s,  2’s,  3’s,  and  4’s  that  formed  the  first  digits  of 
the  two-digit  substitutes.  In  the  second  transposition  block,  this  stack  of 
digits  would  form  a row,  and  as  the  approximately  equal  columns  of  this  block 
were  transcribed,  the  digits  of  that  row  would  appear  in  the  cryptogram  at 
approximately  equal  intervals.  Beurling  called  it  one  of  the  best  hand  systems 
he  ever  faced.  A linguist  disappointed  him  in  not  recovering  the  literal  key 
from  the  numerical  and  so  culminating  the  solution  by  finding  the  keybook. 
The  solved  messages  played  a role  in  convicting  Vanek  as  a spy.  The  Germans 
also  solved  the  system.  By  reading  Czech  exile  messages  from  various  capitals, 
they  learned  so  much  about  the  uprisings  in  Czechoslovakia  in  1944  that  they 
were  able  to  quell  them  with  relative  ease. 

Most  widely  used  of  the  spy  systems  were  the  jargon  codes.  A phrase  in- 
toned in  French,  Dutch,  Norwegian,  or  Italian  in  the  imperturbable  voice  of  a 
British  Broadcasting  Corporation  announcer  would  detonate  explosions  at  a 
German  radio  station,  cause  machine-gun  bullets  to  rattle  in  a wild  raid, 
ignite  a wooden  railway  trestle.  For  these  innocent-sounding  “personal 
messages”  were,  in  large  measure,  signals  to  Resistance  groups  for  an  im- 
minent operation.  Peter  Tompkins  has  evoked  the  atmosphere  of  a group 
listening  for  one  of  these  messages:  “Thus,  on  the  night  of  our  first  expected 
drop  we  sat  tensely  round  the  radio  listening  to  the  news  in  Italian,  waiting 
for  the  announcer  slowly  to  enunciate  his  special  messages:  ‘Catherine  is 
waiting  by  the  well,’  ‘The  sun  will  rise  at  dawn,’  ‘Johnny  needs  sandals,’  then, 
like  a stab  of  light,  our  own  special  message:  ‘William  waits  for  Mary’!  The 
drop  was  on,  due  about  midnight.” 

Other  jargon  codes  acknowledged  receipt  of  messages  and  information. 
The  marco  polo  Resistance  group,  which  sent  its  20-  or  30-page  answers  to 
such  requests  as  “What  is  the  diameter  of  the  pebbles  on  the  beaches  of 


542 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


France?”  and  “Provide  a calendar  of  fair  days  in  the  towns  of  France”  to 
England  by  airplane  in  unenciphered  form  because  of  their  length,  heard  that 
the  information  had  gotten  safely  to  England  when  the  B.B.C.  broadcast  the 
Alexandrine  verse  et  le  desir  s’accroit  quand  l’effet  se  recule  (“And 
desire  grows  when  the  result  recedes”).  Still  other  code  messages  were  in  the 
nature  of  authenticators.  When  a Russian  engineer  came  to  work  with  marco 
polo  to  help  dig  out  information  about  Peenemunde,  where  the  Germans  had 
constructed  their  secret  v-weapon  launching  sites,  the  B.B.C.  confirmed  his 
identity  with  the  phrase  les  elephants  mangent  les  fraises  (“The  elephants 
are  eating  the  strawberries”),  which  is  nothing  if  not  unmistakable. 

Among  the  most  dramatic  of  the  jargon-code  messages  were  the  two  that 
set  in  motion  all  across  France  a massive  underground  sabotage  of  German 
transportation  and  communications.  When  the  B.B.C.  broadcast,  in  French, 
“It  is  hot  in  Suez,”  the  Resistance  was  to  put  into  effect  the  Green  Plan,  which 
called  for  the  sabotaging  of  railroad  tracks  and  equipment.  “The  dice  are  on 
the  table”  would  institute  the  Red  Plan  for  the  cutting  of  telephone  lines  and 
cables.  Throughout  France  Resistance  leaders  listened  tensely  for  these  code- 
phrases on  their  hidden  radios.  As  D-Day  approached,  the  number  of  mes- 
sages rose  into  the  scores.  Finally,  at  6:30  p.m.  on  June  5,  1944,  the  two 
crucial  messages  were  broadcast,  followed  by  hundreds  of  others,  such  as 
“The  arrow  pierces  steel.”  And,  as  the  underground  leaders  mentally  inter- 
preted them,  they  were  stunned  by  a blinding  realization  that  the  liberation 
for  which  they  had  worked  and  waited  and  hoped  throughout  four  dark  years 
of  Nazi  oppression  was  now  at  hand.  For  many  of  them,  their  hearing  of  a 
jargon-code  message  would  remain  one  of  the  unforgettable  moments  of  their 
lives. 

The  most  famous  of  these  jargon-code  messages  was  the  one  announcing 
D-Day  which  the  Nazis  intercepted,  recognized — and  ignored. 

Abwehr  headquarters  had  discovered  that  the  great  Allied  invasion  of 
Europe  would  be  signaled  to  the  underground  by  the  first  stanza  of  Paul 
Verlaine's  melancholy  “Chanson  d’Automne.”  The  first  half  of  the  stanza, 
when  broadcast  on  the  first  or  the  fifteenth  of  a month,  would  warn  of  the 
imminence  of  the  Anglo-American  invasion.  The  second  half  would  mean: 
“The  invasion  will  begin  within  48  hours  ...  the  count  starting  at  0000  hours 
of  the  day  following  the  transmission.” 

In  January,  1944,  Canaris  had  passed  the  details  to  German  intelligence 
units,  with  orders  for  them  to  listen  for  the  two  messages.  Among  the  units 
that  had  been  straining  for  months  to  pick  them  up  was  that  of  Lieutenant 
Colonel  Hellmuth  Meyer,  intelligence  officer  for  the  German  15th  Army, 
whose  information  came  largely  from  his  30-man  interception  crew.  In  their 
concrete  bunker  at  army  headquarters  near  the  Belgian  border,  filled  with 
sensitive  equipment,  these  experts — each  of  whom  could  speak  three  languages 
fluently — captured  virtually  every  wisp  of  radio  emanation  from  Allied 
sources.  They  had  heard  many  of  the  jargon  messages,  which  irritatingly 


543 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

eluded  their  comprehension.  They  had  even  intercepted  the  calls  of  military 
policemen  using  transmitters  in  jeeps  to  direct  convoys  in  England,  more  than 
100  miles  away.  This  information  had  enabled  Meyer  to  learn  the  names  of 
many  of  the  outfits  preparing  for  the  invasion.  Recently,  however,  these  calls 
had  stopped.  Radio  silence  had  descended  upon  England,  another  bit  of 
evidence  that  the  invasion  of  the  Continent  was  close  at  hand.  Meyer  there- 
upon redoubled  his  efforts  to  pick  up  the  fateful  Verlaine  message. 

On  June  1,  Sergeant  Walter  Reichling  of  Meyer’s  team  was  monitoring  the 
messages  in  French  that  followed  the  9 p.m.  B.B.C.  news.  Kindly  listen  now 
to  a few  personal  messages,”  said  the  announcer.  Reichling  switched  on  a 
wire-recorder.  After  a brief  pause  there  followed  the  first  half  of  the  first 
stanza : 

LES  SANGLOTS  LONGS 
DES  VIOLONS 
DE  L’AUTOMNE 

(“The  long  sobs  of  the  violins  of  autumn”).  Reichling  rushed  to  Meyer’s  office, 
and  the  two  listened  to  the  recording.  Meyer  immediately  informed  the  chief  of 
staff,  who  alerted  his  own  1 5th  Army,  then  teletyped  the  notification  to  O.K.  W. 
and  telephoned  the  two  German  headquarters  charged  with  defending  against 
the  invasion.  But  though  the  message  gave  clear  warning  that  the  invasion 
was  to  be  launched  within  two  weeks,  at  the  most,  nothing  was  done  about  it. 
O.K.W.  thought  that  one  of  the  invasion  headquarters  had  ordered  an  alert, 
and  that  headquarters  thought  that  the  other  one— headed  by  Rommel— had 
done  so.  But  though  Rommel  must  have  known  about  the  message,  he  ap- 
parently discounted  it,  for  on  June  4 he  left  for  a much-needed  home  leave. 

Meyer,  who  knew  nothing  of  this,  strained  to  hear  the  second  half  of  the 
stanza.  “Its  awesome  significance  overwhelmed  Meyer,”  wrote  Cornelius 
Ryan.  “The  defeat  of  the  Allied  invasion,  the  lives  of  hundreds  of  thousands 
of  his  countrymen,  the  very  existence  of  his  country  would  depend  on  the  speed 
with  which  he  and  his  men  monitored  the  broadcast  and  alerted  the  front. 
Meyer  and  his  men  would  be  ready  as  never  before.” 

There  were  at  least  15  other  D-Day  messages  which  the  Germans  inter- 
cepted and  interpreted.  On  June  2,  for  example,  O.K.H.  teletyped  to  an 
invasion  defense  headquarters  detailed  information  received  from  the 
R.S.H.A.  about  jargon  messages.  Within  three  days  after  hearing  messieurs, 
faites  vos  jeux  (“Gentlemen,  place  your  bets”),  l electricite  date  du 
vingtieme  siecle  (“Electricity  dates  from  the  20th  century  ),  or  some  other 
messages,  O.K.H.  warned,  “die  Invasion  rollen."  But  the  Germans  placed 
most  credence  in  the  Verlaine  message. 

It  came  at  9: 15  p.m.  June  5:

d’une  langueur 

MONOTONE 


544 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


(“Wound  my  heart  with  a monotonous  languor”).  Meyer  hurried  out  of  his 
office  with  what  “was  probably  the  most  important  message  the  Germans  had 
intercepted  throughout  the  whole  of  World  War  II.”  In  the  dining  room  of 
headquarters,  he  breathlessly  told  General  Hans  von  Salmuth,  the  15th  Army

The  German  15th  Army  detects  the  open-code  message  to  the  French  Underground 
that  warns  that  the  invasion  of  Europe  will  start  within  48  hours 


commander,  who  was  playing  bridge,  that  the  second  half  of  the  vital  mes- 
sage had  arrived.  Von  Salmuth  considered  a moment,  ordered  the  15th  Army 
on  full  alert,  then  returned  to  his  cards.  “I'm  too  old  a bunny  to  get  excited 
about  this,”  he  remarked  to  the  other  players. 

Meanwhile,  Meyer  telephoned  his  headquarters,  and  later  dispatched 


545 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

“Teletype  No.  2117/26  urgent  to  67th,  81st,  82nd,  89th  Corps;  Military 
Governor  Belgium  and  Northern  France ; Army  Group  B ; 1 6th  Flak  Division ; 
Admiral  Channel  Coast;  Luftwaffe  Belgium  and  Northern  France.  Message 
of  B.B.C.,  2115,  June  5,  has  been  processed.  According  to  our  available 
records  it  means  ‘Expect  invasion  within  48  hours,  starting  0000,  June  6.’  ” 
It  was  then  only  about  three  hours  until  18,000  paratroopers  would  drop  into 
the  hedgerows  of  Normandy  to  begin  the  invasion,  only  about  eight  hours  to 
the  H-Hour  landing  on  Omaha,  Juno,  Sword,  and  the  other  beaches.  All  the 
German  commands  were  notified — except  one.  For  reasons  that  have  never 
been  fully  explained,  the  German  7th  Army,  the  one  on  which  would  fall  the 
brunt  of  the  cross-channel  attack,  was  never  alerted  to  D-Day. 

In  the  United  States,  a great  battle  to  wrest  almost  infinite  power  from  the 
infinitesimal  atom  was  plunged  in  secrecy  as  deep  as  nature’s  own.  Congress 
did  not  know  about  it:  the  two-billion-dollar  cost  of  creating  the  atomic  bomb 
was  appropriated  from  a special  presidential  emergency  fund.  References  to 
uranium  were  kept  out  of  the  newspapers.  The  huge  plants  and  laboratories 
necessary  were  built  in  sections  of  the  country  as  remote  as  possible — Oak 
Ridge,  Tennessee;  Hanford,  Washington;  atop  a mesa  at  Los  Alamos,  New 
Mexico.  And  everybody  and  everything  had  a codename,  beginning  with  the 
very  name  of  the  project : the  Manhattan  engineering  district.  Even  before 
it  came  into  being,  the  bomb  was  being  called  the  gadget,  the  device,  s-1, 
the  thing,  the  beast,  or  simply  it.  Later,  after  its  probable  dimensions  had 
evolved,  the  scientists  called  the  uranium  bomb,  which  would  bring  the  two 
masses  of  uranium  into  one  of  the  critical  size  by  shooting  one  into  another 
down  a gun  barrel,  the  thin  man  after  President  Roosevelt.  The  plutonium 
bomb,  which  would  implode  a sphere  of  plutonium  and  thus  would  require  a 
bulkier  casing,  was  called,  in  contradistinction,  the  fat  man  after  Churchill. 
When  the  thin  man’s  gun  barrel  was  shortened,  it  became  known  as  the 
LITTLE  BOY. 

The  man  in  charge  of  the  project,  Brigadier  General  Leslie  R.  Groves,  was 
sometimes  called  relief,  sometimes  99 — from  the  way  his  secretary  wrote 
“G.G.”  for  “General  Groves.”  In  fact,  some  of  the  scientists  who  were  less 
bemused  than  most  by  the  secret-club  nature  of  the  project  simply  referred 
to  him  as  “G.G.”  A special  operation  to  ascertain  German  atomic  capabili- 
ties was  called  alsos,  a Greek  word  meaning  “groves.”  Dr.  Arthur  Holly 
Compton  became  a.  h.  comas  or  a.  holly.  Niels  Bohr,  one  of  the  top  atomic 
scientists,  was  rechristened  Nicholas  baker,  and  Enrico  Fermi  became 
henry  farmer.  The  Los  Alamos  laboratory  was  site  y;  k-25  was  the  gaseous 
diffusion  plant  at  Oak  Ridge  and  y-12  the  electromagnetic  plant  there.  For 
Manhattan  District  purposes,  the  University  of  Chicago  was  known  as  the 
Chicago  metallurgical  laboratory,  and  the  first  man  to  take  charge  of  the 
atom-splitting  work  there,  Gregory  Breit,  was  rather  uninhibitedly  referred  to 
as  the  coordinator  of  rapid  rupture.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Though  telegraphic  messages  were  handled  by  the  Signal  Corps  with  its 
own  cryptographic  equipment,  a need  arose  for  secrecy  in  telephone  conversa- 
tions in  the  nationwide  project,  which  frequently  sent  key  officials  into  the 
field  far  from  any  cipher  machines.  The  first  telephonic  cipher  was  devised  on 
an  impromptu  basis  by  Groves’s  secretary,  Mrs.  Jean  O’Leary,  when  she 
had  to  telephone  some  secret  information  to  him.  “Go  get  what  you  always  see 
me  using,”  she  said.  Groves  bought  a pack  of  her  favorite  cigarettes  and 
spelled  out  the  message  as  she  gave  each  letter  by  its  position  in  the  words  on 
the  pack.  A few  days  later,  Groves  himself  made  up  what  he  called  a “quad- 
ratic code”  for  use  with  a “number  of  people  with  whom  I might  have  had  to 
talk  over  the  phone  on  matters  of  high  secrecy.  Each  one  was  different  and  as 
far  as  I can  recall  1 was  the  only  one  who  had  all  the  codes.  Possibly  Mrs. 
O’Leary  kept  them  all  in  one  of  the  top-secret  safes.  People  were  instructed  to 
carry  them  in  their  billfolds  and  report  instantly  if  they  were  lost.”  The  quad- 
ratic code  was  actually  a 10  x 10  checkerboard,  like  this  one,  a typewritten 
square  about  3j  x 4 inches  that  Groves  used  with  Lieutenant  Colonel  Peer  da 
Silva,  chief  of  security  at  Los  Alamos :

Teller  might  be  enciphered  93,  31,  64,  28,  07,  70,  and  U-235  as  23,  80,  43,  84, 
77.  No  key  pattern  is  apparent,  and  the  square  provides  a satisfyingly  sufficient 
complement  of  plaintext  letters  to  suppress  frequency:  nine  e’s,  seven  t’s,  six 
i’s,  six  o’s,  and  so  on.  All  letters  are  represented.  “The  codes  were  not  used  to 
spell  out  an  entire  message,”  Groves  has  written,  “but  rather  one  or,  at 
most,  a few  key  words.  . . . Even  in  spelling  out  the  key  words,  it  was  not  usual 
to  spell  them  out  in  their  entirety.  Between  [J.  Robert]  Oppenheimer  and 
myself,  only  the  first  two  or  three  letters  would  normally  be  needed.”  A 
checkerboard  is  hardly  a high-security  cipher,  but  in  view  of  this  brevity,  of 
Groves’s  assurance  that  “all  codes  were  constantly  changed,  as  we  recognized 
how  easily  any  code  could  be  broken  if  enough  messages  were  available,”  and 
of  a spy’s  difficulty  in  tapping  just  the  right  telephone  wire  to  intercept  one  of 
these  messages,  it  seems  adequate  to  its  purpose.  In  any  event,  there  is  no 
record  of  anything  having  been  compromised  through  its  interpretation. 

“Most  of  our  telephone  calls  included  a great  deal  of  double  talk  and 
references  to  things  and  individuals  which  no  one  else  would  easily  spot,” 
Groves  has  noted.  One  of  these  spur-of-the-moment  jargon  codes  was  em- 
ployed by  Arthur  Compton  when,  on  December  2,  1942,  he  telephoned  James 
B.  Conant,  president  of  Harvard,  to  report  on  Enrico  Fermi’s  unexpectedly 
early  success  in  producing  man’s  first  controlled  chain  reaction  in  a squash 
court  at  Stagg  Field,  Chicago. 

“Jim,  the  Italian  navigator  has  just  landed  in  the  new  world,”  said  Comp- 
ton, who  composed  one  of  the  more  felicitous  jargon  expressions  in  history 
when  he  equated  atomic  fission  with  a new  world  and  made  Fermi  the  Chris- 
topher Columbus  of  nuclear  physics.  “The  earth  was  not  as  large  as  he  had 
estimated,”  Compton  continued,  indicating  to  Conant  that  the  size  of  the 
atomic  pile  was  not  as  large  as  originally  thought  necessary,  “and  he  arrived 
sooner  than  expected.” 

“Were  the  natives  friendly?”  asked  Conant  in  oblique  reference  to  possible 
problems. 

“Yes.  Everyone  landed  safe  and  happy.” 

This  quick  resort  to  indirection  sometimes  partook,  in  the  heavily  intellec- 
tual Manhattan  District  atmosphere,  of  a somewhat  exotic  nature.  Compton 
once  had  to  discuss  the  problem  that  the  by-products  of  fissionable  material 
might  pollute  the  water  supply.  He  succeeded  in  conveying  this  message  about 
this  most  modern  of  difficulties  through  fairly  obscure  references  to  ancient 
Greek  mythology.  At  the  other  end  of  the  long-distance  wire,  Crawford  H. 
Greenewalt  of  du  Pont  not  only  understood  but  replied  in  kind. 

When  the  first  atomic  bomb  was  exploded  near  Alamogordo,  New  Mexico, 
the  test  was  given  perhaps  the  least  felicitous  codename  in  history:  trinity. 
Details  of  its  success  were  reported  to  Secretary  of  War  Stimson,  then  at  the 
Potsdam  Conference,  in  still  another  informal  jargon  code.  To  give  Stimson 
some  idea  of  the  immensity  of  the  blast,  the  originator  of  the  message,  special 
consultant  George  L.  Harrison,  related  its  visibility  to  the  250-mile  distance

between  Washington  and  Stimson’s  Highhold  estate  on  Long  Island  and  its 
thunderousness  to  the  60  miles  between  Washington  and  Harrison’s  farm 
at  Upperville,  Virginia.  The  little  boy  in  his  message  referred,  not  to  the 
uranium  bomb,  but  to  the  plutonium  bomb  just  detonated;  his  big  brother 
referred  to  the  uranium  bomb  that  all  Manhattan  District  people  now  felt 
confident  would  explode,  doctor  harkened  back  to  a previous  telegram,  in 
which  Groves  was  referred  to  as  a physician  and  the  trinity  test  as  an 
operation.  Harrison’s  message  read:  doctor  has  just  returned  most 

ENTHUSIASTIC  AND  CONFIDENT  THAT  THE  LITTLE  BOY  IS  AS  HUSKY  AS  HIS  BIG 
BROTHER.  THE  LIGHT  IN  HIS  EYES  DISCERNIBLE  FROM  HERE  TO  HIGHHOLD  AND  I 

could  have  heard  his  screams  from  here  to  my  farm.  Stimson  understood 
it  all  without  trouble  and  interpreted  it  to  President  Harry  S Truman.  But 
the  young  signal  officers  who  deciphered  it  at  the  Potsdam  message  center  had 
no  inkling  of  its  real  meaning,  and  they  speculated  irreverently  on  whether  the 
77-year-old  Stimson  had  become  a father  and  whether  the  Big  Three  would 
adjourn  for  a day  in  respectful  tribute. 

The  mission  of  dropping  the  atomic  bomb  on  Japan  was  given  the  code- 
name  centerboard,  but  so  secret  was  the  project  that  the  officer  in  charge  of 
assigning  codenames  was  not  told  what  it  was  for.  The  transportation  of 
uranium  to  Tinian,  the  Pacific  Island  where  the  bomb  would  be  finally 
assembled  and  from  which  the  plane  would  take  off  for  the  strike,  was  referred 
to  as  bowery  shipments.  Those  who  had  codenamed  the  atomic  bomb  little 
boy  had  severely  underrated  it:  little  boy  stood  14  feet  tall,  measured  five 
feet  in  diameter,  and  weighed  just  under  five  tons. 

When  the  Enola  Gay  took  off  toward  Hiroshima  on  that  meteorologically 
beautiful  morning  of  August  6,  1945,  with  little  boy  in  her  bomb  bay,  she 
carried  also  a special  code  for  reporting  the  bomb’s  effects.  It  was  in  the 
hands  of  Captain  William  S.  Parsons,  the  atomic  expert  who  flew  the  mission. 
He  had  made  it  up  two  days  earlier  with  Brigadier  General  Thomas  F. 
Farrell,  Groves’  personal  representative  on  Tinian.  It  consisted  of  28  items 
covering  every  eventuality  that  they  could  think  of  for  the  drop.  Each  item  had 
been  placed  on  a separate  line,  and  to  transmit  the  strike  report  all  that  Parsons 
had  to  do  was  to  read  off  the  number  of  the  appropriate  line.  In  addition,  the 
code  was  divided  into  three  sections,  able,  baker,  and  cedar,  for  good, 
medium,  and  bad  results.  One  of  these  words  was  to  be  transmitted  first  as 
a general  indication  of  what  was  to  follow.  Farrell  had  practically  memorized 
it: 


able  Line  1 . Clearcut,  successful  in  all  respects. 

2.  Visible  effects  greater  than  trinity. 

3.  Visible  effects  about  equal  to  trinity. 

6.  HO  [Hiroshima,  the  primary  target]. 

7.  KQ  [Kokura,  a secondary  target]. 

8.  NA  [Nagasaki,  a secondary  target].

ence necessary  before  taking  further  steps. 

12.  Doubt  as  to  whether  delivery  was  made  to  planned  target. 

13.  Apparent  functioning  in  an  unprofitable  portion  of  target.

At  8:16  a.m.,  the  incongruously  named  little  boy,  the  most  awesome 
weapon  that  mankind  had  ever  built,  obliterated  Hiroshima  in  a blast  of  fire 
and  destruction  that  killed  60,000  Japanese,  made  the  very  name  of  the  city  a 
synonym  for  horror,  and  changed  the  face  of  war.  A few  minutes  later,  as  the 
Enola  Gay  headed  back  to  Tinian,  Parsons  reported  the  bare  facts  of  the 
holocaust  in  a brief  code  message:  able,  line  1,  line  2,  line  6,  line  9.  Farrell 
translated  it  aloud  to  a small  group  of  observers  without  looking  at  his  code- 
sheet, and  immediately  passed  the  word  to  Washington.  Sixteen  hours  later, 
a stunned  world  learned  that  it  had  entered  the  atomic  age. 

Telephoning  is  an  exceedingly  convenient  way  to  communicate.  How 
delightfully  simple  to  pick  up  a phone,  talk  with  the  other  party,  and  get  every- 
thing settled  in  one  conversation!  Much  easier  than  sending  written  messages 
back  and  forth.  But  the  telephone  is  notoriously  insecure— and  its  offspring, 
the  radiotelephone,  even  more  so.  A single  wiretap  grants  access  to  a tele- 
phone conversation,  and  only  a radio  set  is  needed  to  overhear  radiotelephone 
talk.  And  the  Axis  did  not  hesitate  to  grasp  these  opportunities  at  the  highest 
diplomatic  levels. 

The  most  obvious  protective  measure  against  eavesdropping  is  to  make  up 
codes  for  conversation,  and  this  has  of  course  been  done  at  one  time  or 
another  by  almost  anyone  who  has  spoken  over  the  telephone.  The  codes 
range  from  mere  oblique  references  and  the  most  impromptu  cant  to  elabor- 
ately prepared  lists  of  jargon.  Less  frequently,  a message  might  be  enciphered 
in  a prearranged  system  and  the  ciphertext  read  off  letter  by  letter,  as  with  the 
Manhattan  District  checkerboard.  Or  the  speakers  may  resort  to  a foreign 
language. 

The  United  States  raised  the  latter  device  to  the  level  of  a full-scale  system 
in  both  World  Wars  by  making  use  of  a resource  that  virtually  no  other  com- 
batant had : pools  of  tongues  so  recondite  that  almost  no  one  else  in  the  world 
understood  them.  These  were  the  American  Indian  languages,  which  are 
isolated  both  geographically  and  linguistically.  In  1918,  eight  Choctaws  of

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Company  D,  141st  Infantry,  transmitted  orders  by  field  telephone;  this  was 
the  idea  of  Captain  E.  W.  Horner,  who  named  Solomon  Lewis  as  the  chief  of 
the  detail.  Other  Indian  tongues  were  also  used.  During  preparations  for 
World  War  II,  the  Signal  Corps  tested  Comanches  and  Indians  from  Michi- 
gan and  Wisconsin  in  war  games,  but  most  of  the  codetalkers  in  the  combat 
itself  were  Navaho.  One  reason  probably  was  that  the  tribe  was  large  enough 
(more  than  50,000  persons)  to  furnish  a goodly  number  of  speakers;  another, 
that  reportedly  only  28  non-Navahos — mainly  anthropologists  and  mission- 
aries could  speak  the  language,  and  none  of  these  were  German  or  Japanese ; 
a third  reason  was  the  extreme  difficulty  of  the  tongue  and  the  near  impossi- 
bility even  if  someone  did  learn  it — of  counterfeiting  its  sounds. 

“Sounds  [in  Navaho]  must  be  reproduced  with  pedantic  neatness 
almost  as  if  a robot  were  talking,”  wrote  anthropologist  Clyde  Kluckhohn. 
“The  talk  of  those  who  have  learned  Navaho  as  adults  always  has  a flabby 
quality  to  the  Navaho  ear.  They  neglect  a slight  hesitation  a fraction  of  a 
second  before  uttering  the  stem  of  the  word.”  A hint  of  its  complexity  may 
be  seen  in  some  of  its  verb  forms,  on  which  it  insists.  The  stems  of  "many 
Navaho  verbs  differ  with  the  object  acted  upon.  Thus  one  stem  must  be 
used  with  long  objects  (pencils,  sticks),  another  with  slender  flexible  objects 
(snakes,  thongs),  and  still  others  with  granular  masses  (sugar,  salt),  things 
bundled  up  (hay,  bundles  of  clothing),  fabrics  (paper,  blankets),  viscous  objects 
(mud,  feces),  bulky  round  objects,  container-and-contents,  animate  objects, 
and  so  forth.  An  entirely  different  verb  form  concerns  itself  with  the  manner 
of  knowing  an  event.  For  example,  a Navaho  must  use  one  form  if  he  himself 
is  aware  of  the  actual  start  of  rain,  another  if  he  believes  that  rain  was  falling 
for  some  time  in  his  locality  before  he  noticed  it,  and  so  on.  “Because  so 
much  is  expressed  and  implied  by  the  few  syllables  that  make  up  a single 
verb  form,  the  Navaho  verb  is  like  a tiny  imagist  poem.”  Thus  “na’lldil” 
means  You  are  accustomed  to  eat  plural  separable  objects  one  at  a 
time.” 

A cryptosystem  like  that  boasts  considerable  security,  and  it  is  not  surpris- 
ing that  the  dark-skinned,  black-haired  Navaho  became  a familiar  sight  in 
Marine  regimental,  divisional,  or  corps  command  posts,  translating  a mes- 
sage into  a conglomeration  of  Navaho,  American  slang,  and  military  termin- 
ology as  he  huddled  over  a radio  set  in  the  Pacific  combat  zone.  Close  friends 
usually  worked  together.  The  number  of  Navaho  codetalkers  in  the  Marines 
rose  from  30  at  the  start  of  the  war  to  420  at  the  end.  They  relayed  operational 
orders  with  a secrecy  that  helped  the  United  States  advance  from  the  Solomons 
to  Okinawa. 

Linguistic  codetalking,  jargon  codes,  or  double  meanings  all  use  the  human 
speaker  as  the  coding  machine.  But  this  job  may  be  delegated  to  a real 
machine— the  scrambler.  These  two  modes  of  oral  secrecy,  the  human  and  the 
mechanical,  correspond  to  the  two  basic  forms  of  cryptosystems.  Human 
coding  transmutes  words,  syllables,  and  sounds  (as  in  Pig  Latin)— the  linguistic 


551 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

elements  of  speech — into  secret  forms  and  so  parallels  code.  Both  ciphers  and 
scramblers,  on  the  other  hand,  work  upon  particles  of  a text  cut  up  without 
regard  to  linguistic  functions.  From  this  analogy,  scrambler  methods  of 
modifying  speech  are  called  “ciphony”  (from  “cipher”  plus  “telephony”).  The 
field  of  secret  voice  communication  as  a whole  may  be  termed  “cryptophony.” 

Though  it  was  only  in  World  War  II  that  scramblers  came  into  widespread 
use,  and  only  in  that  war  that  serious  attempts  began  to  be  made  to  solve 
scrambled  speech,  devices  to  assure  telephonic  secrecy  had  been  in  existence 
almost  as  long  as  the  telephone  itself.  The  granddaddy  of  these  was  patented 
on  December  20,  1881,  only  five  years  after  Bell  obtained  his  patent  on  the 
telephone.  Its  inventor,  25-year-old  James  Harris  Rogers,  an  American 
electrical  pioneer  who  was  then  chief  electrician  for  the  Capitol,  wrote:  “My 
invention  consists  in  throwing  a message  sent  from  any  transmitting  instru- 
ment through  two  or  more  circuits  alternately  in  rapid  succession  ...  in  such 
a manner  that  anyone  tapping  but  one  of  the  circuits  is  unable  to  obtain  any- 
thing but  a confused  and  unintelligible  series  of  signals.  . . . The  two  or  more 
lines  on  which  a signal  is  transmitted  according  to  my  plan  may  be  carried  to 
a common  terminus  by  widely  different  routes,  and  thus  it  will  be  impossible 
for  any  person  wishing  to  do  so  to  . . . or  tap  both  lines  at  the  same  time.” 

Later  methods  operate  more  directly  on  the  speech  itself,  often  in  ways  that 
resemble  transposition,  substitution,  and  null  ciphers.  In  most  of  the  substitu- 
tion systems,  ciphony  selects  one  component  out  of  the  many  that  make  up 
the  complex  phenomenon  of  speech  and  alters  it.  It  usually  chooses  frequency, 
though  some  scramblers  distort  volume.  Frequency  here  refers  to  the  number 
of  times  the  vocal  chords  vibrate;  it  is  usually  stated  in  terms  of  cycles  per 
second,  or  c.p.s.,  so  that  a frequency  of  500  c.p.s.  means  that  the  vocal  chords 
are  vibrating  500  times  a second.  Because  of  the  resonance  of  the  vocal  organs, 
most  sounds  in  speech  combine  several  frequencies,  and  each  sound  has  its 
distinctive  combination  of  frequencies.  The  main  frequency  of  the  /e/  sound 
in  “feel,”  for  example,  is  much  higher  than  that  of  the  /u/  sound  in  “fool.” 
Naturally,  the  absolute  frequencies  will  differ  somewhat  from  person  to 
person,  but  it  is  the  relative  variations  within  an  individual’s  speech  that  carry 
much  of  its  information  content. 

Ciphony  seeks  to  conceal  this  content  by  shifting  the  frequencies  of  the 
sounds  of  speech.  It  can  do  this  because  the  telephone  first  converts  these 
sounds  into  a fluctuating  electrical  current,  which  the  tubes,  switches,  filters, 
and  circuits  that  comprise  a scrambler  then  modify  according  to  well-known 
principles  of  electricity.*  Though  this  current  may  be  transformed  in  a great 

* It  does  not  seem  possible  to  devise  a scrambler  that  distorts  the  sound  itself  (i.e.,  the 
vibrations  in  the  air)  because,  once  the  waves  were  degraded  by,  say,  some  kind  of  baffle, 
they  could  not  be  restored  to  their  original  form.  Transposition  systems,  on  the  other  hand, 
might  be  possible  in  a very  crude  form  by  means  of  mechanical  phonographs.  From  a 
practical  point  of  view,  however,  nonelectrical  scramblers  may  be  ruled  out.  None  ever 
seems  to  have  been  constructed.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


variety  of  ways,  many  affect  the  voice  essentially  alike,  so  that  there  are 
relatively  few  basic  scrambles. 

The  simplest  is  inversion.  This  turns  the  voice  upside  down.  Though  nor- 
mal speech  ranges  from  about  70  to  about  7,000  c.p.s.,  the  telephone,  for 
engineering  reasons,  responds  only  to  sounds  from  about  300  to  3,300  c.p.s. 
It  is  this  frequency  band  that  is  inverted.  A voice  tone  of  300  c.p.s.  will 
emerge  from  the  inverter  at  3,300  c.p.s.,  and  vice  versa.  A tone  of  750  c.p.s. 
will  become  2,250  c.p.s.,  and  again  vice  versa.  It  is  the  equivalent  of  a = z, 
b = y,  . . . , z = a,  a phonetic  atbash.  Inverted  speech  sounds  like  a thin 
high-pitched  squawking,  ringing  with  bell-like  chimes.  The  word  company 
resembles  crinkanope,  Chicago,  sikaybee.  The  inversion  pivots  in  the  middle 
of  the  frequency  band,  which  means  that  tones  in  this  area  somersault  through 
a narrow  range.  A frequency  of  1,625  will  become  1,675.  This  relative  lack  of 
change  results  in  the  phenomenon  that  the  word  inverter  itself,  which  is  com- 
posed largely  of  such  tones,  emerges  from  the  enciphering  process  that  it 
describes  almost  unchanged ! 

Another  simple  technique  is  the  band-shift.  This  is  a kind  of  telephonic 
Caesar  substitution,  in  which  all  the  frequencies  are  shoved  upwards  or  down- 
wards a certain  distance,  with  the  portion  pushed  out  of  the  frequency  band 
reentering  at  the  bottom  or  the  top.  For  example,  a factor  of  1,000  might  be 
added  to  all  frequencies  in  the  300-to-3,300  band,  so  that  a tone  of  500  c.p.s. 
would  be  shifted  to  1,500.  One  of  2,800  c.p.s.  would  then  be  enciphered  to  800. 

Band-splitting  splits  the  frequency  band  into  several  smaller  bands  and 
interchanges  these.  Filters  can  divide  a 250-to-3,000  band  into  five  subbands 
of  550  cycles  each:  subband  a of  250  to  800,  subband  b of  800  to  1,350,  sub- 
band c of  1,350  to  1,900,  subband  d of  1,900  to  2,450,  and  subband  e of 
2,450  to  3,000.  Then  the  scrambler’s  switches  and  circuits  may  replace  a by  c, 
b by  d,  c by  e,  d by  a,  and  e by  b,  thus  jumbling  the  normal  tones.  The  better 
band-splitters  shift  these  substitutions  every  few  seconds  or  milliseconds.  The 
result  sounds  something  like  a recording  of  a Mah-Jongg  game  played  too  fast. 

Masking  systems  bury  the  voice  signal  in  noise.  The  music  from  a phono- 
graph record  can  be  electrically  superimposed  on  the  voice,  drowning  it  out. 
The  descrambler,  which  must  have  an  identical  disk  precisely  synchronized 
with  that  of  the  scrambler,  subtracts  the  phonograph  signal  out,  leaving  the 
voice.  These  systems  resemble  null  ciphers,  which  interlard  the  true  message 
within  a welter  of  spurious  symbols.  Another  system  is  wave-form  modi- 
fication. A fluctuating  electrical  current  operates  upon  the  voice  current  to 
produce  rapid  and  extreme  variations  in  the  amplitude  of  the  transmitted 
speech.  This  sounds  rather  like  a radio  whose  volume  control  is  being  turned 
up  to  full  blast  one  instant  and  then  down  to  a whisper  the  next.  In  the  de- 
scrambler, an  identical  synchronized  current  reverses  these  effects. 

All  these  encipherments  transform  the  speech  only  in  the  frequency 
dimension,  along  the  vertical  axis,  as  it  were.  None  extends  horizontally  along 
the  time  axis.  Systems  that  encipher  by  changing  the  temporal  relationships  of

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


speech’s  continuous  flow  must  preserve  it  momentarily  to  permit  the  trans- 
position. Usually  they  have  used  magnetic  tape. 

Time-division  scramble,  or  T.D.S.,  chops  the  stream  of  speech  into  split- 
second  portions  and  shuffles  them.  It  does  so  by  tape-recording  the  voice  and 
then  picking  off  segments  in  jumbled  order,  using,  say,  five  pickup  heads  that 
a mechanism  activates  in  mixed  sequence.  The  result  is  a literal  hash  of 
sounds.  The  descrambler  uses  five  recording  heads  to  lay  the  sounds  back  on 
a moving  tape  in  their  proper  order.  Another  tape-based  scramble,  the  wobble, 
slides  a pickup  head  back  and  forth  along  the  length  of  the  tape  as  the  tape 
passes  beneath  it.  As  the  head  moves  opposite  to  the  tape’s  direction,  it  will 
read  off  the  signals  faster  than  they  were  recorded,  and  these  will  sound  higher 
than  normal.  As  the  head  moves  with  the  tape,  it  will  read  off  the  signals  more 
slowly  than  they  were  recorded,  and  these  will  sound  lower  than  normal.  The 
result  will  be  an  alternation  of  squeaks  and  growls,  sounding  exactly  as  if  a 
phonograph  record  were  alternately  raced  and  almost  stopped. 

Most  of  the  basic  scrambler  systems  were  invented  during  the  1920s  and 
1930s  by  engineers  for  the  growing  radio  and  telephone  companies.  A need 
for  them  first  became  apparent  when  the  radio  hams  began  listening  in  to  the 
conversations  of  erring  husbands  and  their  wives  and  on  stockbrokers  giving 
tips  on  the  first  public  radiotelephone  service,  offered  after  World  War  I by 
the  Pacific  Telephone  Company  between  Los  Angeles  and  nearby  Catalina 
Island.  The  American  Telephone  & Telegraph  Company  installed  an  inverter. 
While  it  prevented  casual  eavesdropping,  it  would  not  keep  a determined 
amateur  from  inverting  the  inversion.  And  several  did  just  that  on  the  East 
Coast  in  the  latter  1920s  when  the  telephone  company  was  setting  up  its  radio- 
telephone link  to  Europe.  Among  them  was  a young  man  of  20,  William 
Roberts  of  Trenton,  who  even  sold  some  of  his  “De-Scramblers”  to  Latin 
American  countries. 

Growing  realization  of  the  insecurity  of  the  inverter  caused  its  replace- 
ment by  band-splitters  on  both  the  A.  T.  & T.  transatlantic  radiotelephone  cir- 
cuit and  the  Radio  Corporation  of  America’s  circuit  between  San  Francisco, 
Honolulu,  and  Tokyo.  Called  the  a-3,  this  Bell  Telephone  device  not  only 
switched  the  substitution  assignments  for  its  five  subbands  but  inverted  them 
as  well.  However,  of  the  3,840  possible  combinations,  only  1 1 were  considered 
suitable  for  privacy,  and  of  these  only  6 were  actually  used.  They  were  brought 
into  play  in  a cycle  of  36  steps,  each  of  which  remained  for  20  seconds,  giving 
the  a-3  an  overall  period  of  12  minutes.  It  began  operating  between  the 
R.C.A.  post  in  San  Francisco  and  the  Mutual  Telephone  Company  post  in 
Honolulu  in  December,  1937 — and  a few  days  later  the  Tokyo  post,  which 
was  still  using  the  old  inverters,  asked  what  kind  of  system  was  in  use  on  the 
other  leg  of  the  circuit,  since  they  could  not  understand  it.  The  military  took 
the  query  as  proof  that  Japan  was  monitoring  the  mainland  communications. 

It  was  the  a-3  that  brought  news  of  World  War  II  to  President  Roosevelt, 
who  was  awakened  early  on  the  morning  of  September  1,  1939,  by  a call  from 


555 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

the  American  ambassador  in  Paris,  William  C.  Bullitt.  As  the  United  States 
was  drawn  closer  and  closer  to  war,  the  President  conferred  with  his  emissaries 
abroad  more  and  more  by  scrambler  radiotelephone.  During  the  Battle  of 
France  he  sometimes  spoke  with  Bullitt  several  times  a day.  Characteristically, 
Roosevelt  liked  the  telephone  because  it  cut  through  the  red  tape  of  diplo- 
matic routine  and  the  delays  of  coding  and  cabling  and  because  it  gave  him 
personal  contact  with  the  speaker.  Occasionally  he  spoke  with  Premier  Paul 
Reynaud,  and  frequently  and  increasingly  with  Churchill. 

The  President’s  words  sped  from  the  White  House  to  the  overseas  switch- 
board in  an  A.  T.  & T.  building  at  47  Walker  Street,  New  York.  In  common 
with  all  other  transatlantic  conversations,  the  nasal  Roosevelt  drawl  then 
entered  a special  locked  room,  barred  to  all  except  government-licensed  em- 
ployees, where  the  a-3  equipment  mangled  it.  Here  engineers  watched  dials 
and  listened  to  the  sound  to  make  sure  that  the  speech  was  properly  scrambled. 
At  the  transmitter,  channel  mixers  continually  shifted  the  transmission  from 
one  frequency  to  another,  so  that  anyone  listening  on  one  circuit  would  hear 
it  go  suddenly  blank. 

And  someone  was  indeed  listening.  The  Deutschen  Reichspost — which, 
like  other  European  post  offices,  handled  telephone  and  telegraph  traffic  as 
well  as  mail — realized  that  the  only  telephone  link  between  England  and  the 
United  States  was  the  radio  circuit,  and  it  reported  “The  special  national 
political  importance  of  this  communication  connection  has  caused  the  D.R.P. 
to  try  with  all  available  scientific  means  to  decipher  the  conversation  carried 
on  this  connection.”  A task  force  under  Postal  Counselor  Graduate  Engineer 
Vetterlein  of  the  D.R.P.’s  Forschungsanstalt  (“Research  Bureau”)  set  to 
work  on  the  problem.  The  engineers  soon  learned  the  nature  of  the  a-3 
system  and  found  that  they  had  to  wire  circuits  for  only  the  six  different  com- 
binations of  subband  substitutions.  Naturally,  they  had  to  experiment  to  find 
the  exact  subband  divisions  and  the  sequence  in  which  the  six  combinations 
were  used,  but  from  start  to  finish  the  solution  took  only  a few  months.  They 
completed  it  by  September,  1941.  Within  a few  more  months  the  D.R.P.  had 
established  an  intercept  and  voice-cryptanalysis  station  on  the  Dutch  coast. 
Its  elaborate  equipment  instantaneously  unscrambled  the  conversations, 
losing  only  a syllable  or  two  after  a key  change  until  the  proper  one  was  found. 
When  this  was  in  operation,  the  German  Postal  Minister,  Wilhelm  Ohnesorge, 
notified  Adolf  Hitler:

Dr.  Ohnesorge  appended  a concrete  example  of  the  intercept  station’s 
success:  a cryptanalyzed  and  translated  conversation  plucked  from  the  ether 
at  7:45  p.m.  September  7,  1941.  A Briton  who  had  just  arrived  in  the  United 
States  was  talking  with  a colleague  back  in  England  about  the  need  for  a 
man  named  Campbell  to  have  an  assistant  and  about  their  propaganda 
bureau. 

The  group  continued  to  send  transcripts  to  Hitler’s  desk,  including  a 1942 
chat  between  Churchill  (at  Whitehall  4433)  and  a Mr.  Butcher  in  New  York, 
and  one  between  Major  General  Mark  Clark  and  the  Inspector  General’s 
office  in  Washington.  At  1:00  a.m.  July  29,  1943,  they  hit  the  jackpot:  a 
radiotelephone  conversation  between  Roosevelt  and  Churchill.  They  were 
discussing  the  coup  in  Italy  that  had  just  ousted  Mussolini’s  government: 

“We  do  not  want  proposals  for  an  armistice  to  be  made  before  we  have 
been  definitely  approached,”  said  Churchill. 

“That  is  right,”  agreed  Roosevelt. 

“We  can  also  wait  quietly  for  one  or  two  days.” 

“That  is  right,”  said  Roosevelt  again. 

Churchill  said  that  he  would  contact  the  king  of  Italy,  and  Roosevelt 
replied  that  he  too  would  get  in  touch  with  “Emmanuel.”  “I  do  not  know 
quite  how  1 shall  do  this,”  he  admitted.  The  Germans  took  the  conversation 
as  evidence  of  the  treachery  and  complicity  of  the  Italians:  “This  is  complete 
proof  that  secret  negotiations  between  the  Anglo-Americans  and  Italy  are 
under  way,”  the  war  diary  of  the  O.K.W.  noted.  This  does  not  seem  to  have 
been  the  case;  in  any  event,  the  Allies  were  cool  to  the  coup. 

Later  the  Forschungsanstalt  again  picked  up  a Roosevelt-Churchill 
conversation — Churchill  was  practically  addicted  to  the  telephone,  calling 
Roosevelt  at  all  hours  from  his  bombproof  shelter  in  Whitehall,  and  placing

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Similar  activities  had,  rather  surprisingly,  been  started  in  the  United  States 
even  before  the  D.R.P.  project  began.  Early  in  October,  1940,  the  communica- 
tions division  of  the  National  Defense  Research  Committee  set  up  a group  on 
speech  secrecy.  It  would  concentrate  on  cryptanalysis,  partly  to  eavesdrop  on 
enemy  radiotelephone  talk,  partly  to  evaluate  proposed  Allied  scramblers. 
The  N.D.R.C.  contracted  with  A.  T.  & T.’s  Bell  Telephone  Laboratories  for 
these  studies,  and  during  World  War  II  the  laboratories  handled  most  of  the 
American  speech-scrambling  work.  It  was  done  in  two  small  workshops  in 
the  vast  pile  of  stone  at  463  West  Street,  New  York,  that  housed  Bell  Labs. 
Though  the  shops  faced  on  an  inside  courtyard,  both  had  their  windows 
painted  black  because  of  the  secret  nature  of  their  work.  In  charge  was 
Walter  Koenig,  Jr.,  a short,  reticent  engineer  then  turning  40  who  had  gone  to 
work  for  Bell  right  after  being  graduated  from  Harvard  with  an  A.B.  in 
chemistry  and  physics.  Much  of  his  work  dealt  with  acoustics,  in  which  the 
telephone  company  had  a natural  interest,  and  he  slid  into  descrambling 
because  he  had  helped  develop  an  instrument  that  was  to  play  an  important 
role  in  scrambler  cryptanalysis. 

Before  his  device  came  into  widespread  use,  however,  a much  easier-to- 
operate  and  more  common  instrument  proved  to  have  unsuspected  capabilities 
as  a tool  for  solving  ciphony.  This  was  the  human  ear.  Anyone  who  has 
managed  to  converse  at  a noisy  cocktail  party  should  not  be  surprised  at  the 
ear's  ability  to  pick  out  speech — and  the  right  speech — from  amidst  a babble 
of  noise.  Nevertheless,  wrote  Koenig: 

Beginners  in  the  study  of  privacy  systems  never  fail  to  be  amazed  at  the  diffi- 
culty of  scrambling  speech  sufficiently  to  destroy  the  intelligence.  The  ear  can 
tolerate  or  even  ignore  surprising  amounts  of  noise,  nonlinearity,  frequency  dis- 
tortion, misplaced  components,  superpositions,  and  other  forms  of  interference. 
We  can  therefore  very  often  obtain  partial  or  even  complete  intelligence  from  a 
privacy  system  by  partial  or  imperfect  decoding.  . . . These  non-cryptographic 
methods  are  very  important,  because  they  may  reduce  the  delay  in  obtaining  the 
intelligence  substantially  to  zero.  . . . Some  of  them,  of  course,  result  in  poor 
quality,  but  the  saving  of  time,  labor  and  equipment  may  be  very  great. 

With  some  experience  in  hearing  how  words  sound  when  scrambled,  with 
some  practice  in  trying  to  make  out  scrambled  speech,  and  with  repeated 
listenings  to  a scrambled  conversation,  one  can  understand  a goodly  portion 
of  what  has  been  said  even  without  electrically  cryptanalyzing  the  scramble. 
As  a not-at-all  extreme  example,  some  Bell  Telephone  Laboratories  engineers 
recovered  an  average  of  47  per  cent  of  the  words  scrambled  by  the  a-3  simply 
by  listening  to  it  several  times.  This  means  that  almost  half  the  intelligence 
leaked  through.  In  one  test,  intelligibility  rose  to  76  per  cent,  or  three  quarters 
of  what  was  said.  This  is  enough  to  give  an  eavesdropper  the  gist  of  a conversa- 
tion. 

This  weakness  results  from  the  large  safety  factor  with  which  the  system 
of  oral  communication  is  invested.  Speech  contains  many  more  elements  than 


559 


Censors,  Scramblers,  and  Spies 

it  actually  needs  to  be  understood.  Psychologists  and  communication  engin- 
eers have  demonstrated  this  in  a great  variety  of  tests— which,  interestingly, 
employ  scramblerlike  equipment.  One  test,  for  example,  eliminated  (by 
electrical  means)  all  sounds  below  100  c.p.s.  in  a series  of  nonsense  syllables. 
Subjects  missed  less  than  10  per  cent  of  the  syllables,  and  in  running  speech 
probably  would  have  lost  nothing.  Why,  then,  does  speech  include  these  low- 
frequency  sounds?  Because  low  frequencies  get  around  the  objects  and  corners 
of  everyday  life  much  better  than  high  frequencies;  without  them,  oral  com- 
munication would  be  reduced  much  more  to  the  line  of  sight  and  would  lose 
many  of  its  present  advantages.  The  excess  of  detail  defends  speech  against  the 
noise  and  accidental  distortion  of  ordinary  activities  by  ensuring  that,  even  if 
one  component  is  eroded,  the  others  will  sustain  the  message.  This  super- 
abundance resists  the  deliberate  deformations  of  scrambler  systems  just  as 
strongly.  Thus,  only  1,000  c.p.s.  of  the  full  speech-band  of  about  7,000  c.p.s. 
will  allow  a listener  to  hear  45  per  cent  of  a series  of  nonsense  syllables.  This 
helps  explain  why  the  Bell  engineers  could  understand  47  per  cent  of  the  a-3's 
scrambled  speech  even  without  cryptanalysis. 

“The  fact  that  the  ear  is  such  a good  decoding  tool,”  wrote  Koenig, 
“makes  the  production  of  privacy  systems  very  difficult.  Scrambling  systems 
which  look  very  effective  on  paper  sometimes  turn  out  on  trial  to  degrade  the 
intelligibility  very  little,  although  the  scrambled  speech  usually  sounds  un- 
pleasant. Most  methods  if  they  are  pushed  to  the  point  where  they  do  succeed 
in  hiding  the  intelligibility  are  impossible  to  restore  with  good  quality.  There 
are  in  fact  very  few  speech  privacy  systems  which  achieve  a high  degree  of 
privacy  with  acceptable  quality.” 

The  ear,  however,  cannot  reconstruct  the  specific  nature  of  the  scrambler. 
This  calls  for  precise  differentiation  of  frequencies  and  for  a kind  of  total 
recall  of  the  order  of  many  minute  speech  segments.  These  matters  were  best 
handled  with  the  sound  spectrograph,  an  instrument  that  portrayed  sound 
pictorially.  Ralph  K.  Potter  of  Bell  Labs  had  devised  it— with  some  later  help 
from  Koenig— purely  for  research,  but  its  applications  to  cryptanalyzing 
scramblers  soon  became  evident.  They  were  even  demonstrated  to  Dr.  Van- 
nevar  Bush,  the  highly  respected  head  of  the  Office  of  Scientific  Research  and 
Development,  N.D.R.C.’s  parent  body. 

Bush  saw  how  the  spectrograph,  by  laying  down  a permanent  visualization 
of  scrambled  speech,  enabled  the  scientists  to  compare  this  with  normal  speech, 
to  deduce  from  the  difference  the  type  of  scrambling  employed,  and  so  to 
crack  it.  The  device  records  the  voice  sounds  on  paper  as  a series  of  horizontal 
lines  representing  the  main  frequencies.  In  normal  speech,  these  lines  appear 
and  disappear,  rise  and  fall  in  flowing  patterns  as  the  frequencies  do.  Sounds 
loaded  with  low  frequencies,  like  /fill/,  show  up  in  the  spectrograph  record  as 
a heavy  concentration  of  lines  near  the  bottom  of  the  paper.  The  lines  for 
/fel/  are  much  higher.  In  scrambled  speech,  the  normal  patterns  are  distorted. 
Inversion  has  the  dark  lines  of  the  more  powerful  middle-to-low  frequencies

near  the  top  of  the  spectrogram.  Inflections  which  normally  climb  slope.  A 
band-splitter  shows  the  long  horizontal  divisions  of  the  subbands.  T.D.S. 
consists  of  disjointed  segments  divided  by  sharp  vertical  boundaries. 

Mere  examination  of  the  spectrogram  will  thus  disclose  the  type  of 
scramble;  solution  then  becomes  the  jigsaw-puzzlelike  task  of  cutting  apart 
the  spectrogram  along  the  boundaries  of  the  scramble  and  reassembling  it  to 
re-create  the  flow-pattern  of  normal  speech.  This  reconstruction  will  suggest  the 
key  used  in  the  scramble,  and  the  cryptanalyst  will  set  up  his  own  apparatus 
to  this  key  and  run  the  recording  of  the  scrambled  message  through.  Koenig 
and  his  associates  perfected  spectrographic  cryptanalysis  to  the  point  where, 
in  field  tests  at  Camp  Coles  in  1943,  four  people  working  in  a laboratory  set 
up  in  an  Army  van  truck  solved  T.D.S.  test-scrambles  within  15  to  18  minutes 
of  the  time  of  transmission.  As  a result,  eight  spectrographs  suitable  for  field 
use  were  built  and  delivered— three  to  the  Army,  three  to  the  Navy,  and  two 
to  the  British — between  January  and  May  1944.  Some  of  these  were  apparently 
used  in  cracking  a new  Japanese  scrambler  intercepted  by  the  Army  at  Point 
Reyes  and  later  at  Two  Rock  Ranch,  California.  The  results  sometimes 
yielded  valuable  information  about  forthcoming  Japanese  moves. 

Much  of  Bell  Labs’  expertise  was  developed  in  testing  Allied  scrambles, 
particularly  a highly  regarded  combination  of  band-splitting  and  T.D.S.  This 
was  called  a 2-dimensional,  or  2-D,  scramble  because  it  operated  along  both 
the  vertical  (frequency)  and  the  horizontal  (time)  axes.  With  its  trusty  spectro- 
graph, the  Bell  Labs  defeated  even  the  best  of  these,  the  British  2-D  privacy 
system.  The  reconstitution  of  speech  patterns  from  the  many  little  rectangles 
in  the  spectrogram  was  a tedious  job  but  surprisingly  quick — a crew  of  six 
men  would  take  from  two  to  three  hours  to  do  it.  The  experience  suggested 
some  humble  but  effective  ways  of  increasing  privacy:  speaking  in  a low- 
pitched  monotone  to  diminish  speech  patterns,  varying  the  length  and  cycle 
of  T.D.S.  elements  to  eliminate  periodicity,  and  adding  noise  after  scrambling 
the  speech.  The  noise  would  not  bother  the  ear,  but  it  would  spatter  the 
spectrogram  with  false  lines  that  would  mislead  the  solver.  In  fact,  noise  of 
the  right  kind  might  make  T.D.S.  or  2-D  spectrograms  appear  more  contin- 
uous in  their  scrambled  order  than  in  the  order  that  unscrambles  the  speech 
but  scrambles  the  noise! 

Ciphony  never  attained  the  security  of  written  communications.  Crypto- 
logic terminology  reflects  this  difference  by  calling  scramblers  “privacy” 
systems  and  not  “secrecy”  systems.  Late  in  the  war,  Roosevelt  and  Churchill 
recognized  this  gauzelike  security  and  switched  from  the  telephone  to  teletype 
talks,  enciphered  by  a little  box  called  “Telekrypton”  that  was  almost  cer- 
tainly the  one-time  tape.  Nevertheless,  ciphony  made  such  great  strides 
during  the  conflict  that  General  George  C.  Marshall,  whose  fear  of  using  a 
scrambler  had  had  such  dire  effects  on  December  7,  1941,  could  say  three 
years  later,  “We  have  the  very  finest  equipment  now.”

THE  SCRUTABLE  ORIENTALS 


from  the  Sunday  morning  when  Commander  Mitsuo  Fuchida,  in  his 
bomber  high  over  Pearl  Harbor,  radioed  “tora,  tora,  tora  ! ’ to  indicate 
that  his  attack  force  had  achieved  complete  surprise,  the  gods  of  war  had 
smiled  without  surcease  upon  the  armed  forces  of  imperial  Japan.  The  strike 
at  Pearl  Harbor  had  decimated  the  United  States  fleet.  Unhindered,  the 
Greater  East  Asia  Co-Prosperity  Sphere  expanded  rapidly  and  uninter- 
ruptedly. Guam  was  captured  on  December  10,  Wake  on  the  23rd.  Two  days 
later  Hong  Kong  fell.  Japanese  aircraft  sank  Prince  of  Wales  and  Repulse, 
giving  Winston  Churchill  his  worst  shock  of  the  war  and  leaving  the  whole 
western  Pacific,  the  Indian  Ocean,  Oceania,  and  even  Australia  virtually  un- 
defended by  naval  forces.  Tojo’s  armies  overran  Singapore  and  Malaya  with 
its  rubber  plantations,  then  the  Dutch  East  Indies  with  its  great  oil  fields. 
Siam  and  the  Solomons  were  in  their  hands.  China  was  under  blockade.  In 
May  the  Philippines  surrendered.  Within  six  stupefying  months,  the  Rising  Sun 
shone  upon  nearly  a tenth  of  the  globe’s  surface.  Nippon's  enemies  had  been 
wiped  from  the  seas.  Her  troops  raped  and  pillaged  from  bustling  Rangoon  to 
the  languorous  South  Sea  islands.  It  was  the  most  rapid  conquest  in  history. 

It  amply  fulfilled  the  Japanese  war  plan.  Japan  did  not  intend  to  invade  the 
United  States.  Rather,  she  planned  to  feed  upon  the  riches  of  the  conquered 
territories  behind  a ring  of  impregnable  defense  positions,  from  which  she 
would  beat  off  any  attacker.  But  the  high  command,  bedazzled  by  success  and 
greedy  for  more,  decided  instead  to  continue  the  sweep  before  its  momentum 
was  lost.  The  admirals  and  generals  pointed  out  that  naval  losses,  which  they 
had  anticipated  at  25  per  cent,  had  been  infinitesimal.  The  largest  ship  sunk 
had  been  a destroyer,  and  so  more  than  adequate  forces  remained  for  the  new 
drive.  Furthermore,  they  reasoned,  the  defense  perimeter  would  be  protected 
as  much  by  greater  depth  as  by  greater  consolidation.  They  therefore  set  in 
motion  two  ambitious  plans.  One  was  an  amphibious  assault  southward  to 
Port  Moresby,  a town  on  the  southeastern  tip  of  New  Guinea  only  400  miles 
from  Australia.  The  other  pivoted  on  Midway,  a tiny  atoll  in  the  middle  of 
the  Pacific  that  stood  as  a sentinel  to  Hawaii. 

This  second  plan  had  two  parts.  The  first  part  aimed  at  the  atoll’s  capture. 
Its  two  coral  islets — the  larger  barely  two  miles  long — possessed  no  intrinsic

worth  but  great  strategic  value,  for  whoever  held  them  controlled  the  central 
Pacific  and  hence  the  approaches  to  either  end  of  the  oceanic  basin.  The 
second  and  more  important  part  of  the  plan  sought  to  lure  out  the  remainder 
of  the  American  fleet  and  destroy  it.  Admiral  Isoroku  Y amamoto,  Commander 
in  Chief  of  Japan’s  Combined  Fleet,  appreciated  America’s  industrial  might 
and  realized  that  Japan  had  to  win  quickly — before  America  could  bring  it  to 
bear.  He  also  knew  that  the  United  States  could  not  let  Midway  go  by  default, 
as  it  had  Wake  and  Guam.  When  the  Pacific  Fleet,  enfeebled  by  the  losses  at 
Pearl  Harbor,  steamed  out  to  defend  the  atoll,  he  would  fall  upon  it  with  his 
vastly  superior  forces  and  annihilate  it.  This  final  disaster  would  convince 
Americans  that  Japan  could  not  be  beaten.  They  would  therefore  quit  a 
pointless  struggle  and  leave  Japan  master  of  the  western  Pacific.  Or  so  the 
warlords  purposed. 

They  did  not  know  that  the  United  States  had  fashioned  a secret  weapon 
of  such  potency  that  it  could  alter  the  balance  of  power  in  the  Pacific.  It  was 
located  in  the  long,  narrow,  windowless  basement  of  the  14th  Naval  District’s 
Administration  Building  in  the  Navy  yard  at  Pearl  Harbor.  Vaultlike  doors 
protected  its  secrets;  steel-barred  gates  at  the  top  and  bottom  of  the  stairs 
kept  out  visitors;  guards  stood  a round-the-clock  watch.  This  office  was 
staffed,  when  the  war  broke  out,  with  about  30  officers  and  men.  It  was 
equipped  with  International  Business  Machine  Corporation  tabulators,  which 
were  partitioned  off  in  a separate  section  because  of  the  racket  they  made.  Its 
raw  material  came  in  by  courier  from  the  radio  intercept  station  at  Wailupe. 
This  was  the  so-called  Combat  Intelligence  Unit,  the  radio  intelligence 
organization  that  served  the  Pacific  Fleet. 

Lieutenant  Commander  Joseph  John  Rochefort  had  commanded  it  since 
May  of  1941.  Before  Pearl  Harbor,  the  bulk  of  its  personnel  worked  on  inter- 
ception, direction-finding,  and  traffic  analysis;  the  unit  fed  these  results  to  the 
fleet  intelligence  officer.  Though  one  of  its  young  cryptanalysts,  Chief  Radio- 
man Farnsley  C.  Woodward,  had  attacked  the  Japanese  diplomatic  systems 
in  use  by  the  Honolulu  consulate  as  a favor  for  counterintelligence,  the  unit’s 
main  cryptanalytic  duties  before  Pearl  Harbor  involved  the  solution  of  the 
Japanese  flag  officers’  system  and  miscellaneous  administrative,  personnel, 
and  meteorological  codes.  It  had  only  three  real  cryptanalysts  to  handle  this 
workload,  Rochefort  and  Lieutenant  Commanders  Thomas  H.  Dyer  and 
Wesley  A.  Wright.  The  others  were  trainees,  aides,  clerks,  and  translators. 
Since  August  of  1941  it  had  been  working  a seven-day  week;  in  October  it 
went  to  a night  watch  as  well — the  only  unit  in  Pearl  to  do  so. 

Three  days  after  Pearl  Harbor  the  unit  was  given  a major  change  in  assign- 
ment. It  was  to  discontinue  work  on  the  flag  officers’  system  (which  was  to  be 
analyzed  in  op-20-g  in  the  Navy  Department  in  Washington)  and  to  join  in 
the  attack  and  breakdown  of  the  Japanese  fleet  cryptographic  system,  dubbed 
jn25  by  op-20-g.  This  most  widely  distributed  and  extensively  used  of  Japan’s 
naval  cryptosystems,  in  which  about  half  her  naval  messages  were  transmitted. 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


563 


was  already  the  target  of  three  other  cryptanalytical  units — a 16th  Naval 
District  group  under  Lieutenant  Rudolph  J.  Fabian  on  Corregidor,  a British 
group  at  Singapore,  and  op-20-g.  They  had  determined  that  it  was  a two-part 
code  of  about  45,000  five-digit  groups,  enciphered  by  two  volumes  of  50,000 
five-digit  additives  each.  The  b,  or  second,  edition  had  come  into  force  on 
December  1,  1940,  and  by  the  following  November  messages  in  it  were  partly 
readable.  At  6 a.m.  on  December  4,  1941,  new  additive  books  came  into  effect, 
together  with  new  indicators.  Fabian’s  group  broke  into  this  new  encipherment 
four  days  later,  and  by  Christmas  messages  were  again  being  read  as  before.  But 
these  readings  were  tantalizingly  fragmentary,  and  much  remained  to  be  done. 

The  commencement  of  hostilities  generated  an  enormous  increase  in  radio 
traffic  and  consequently  in  the  workload  of  the  Combat  Intelligence  Unit.  To 
handle  it,  the  unit  dragooned  personnel  from  every  possible  source.  It  first 
acquired  the  band  of  the  U.S.S.  California,  which  had  been  badly  damaged  in 
the  first  few  minutes  of  the  air  attack.  Dyer  threw  up  his  hands  when  he  heard 
about  it,  but  music  and  mathematics  and  cryptanalysis  seemed  to  go  together,* 
and  nearly  all  the  bandsmen  proved  above  average  and  some  exceptional  in 
their  new  tasks.  By  May,  the  basement  office  contained  about  120  persons.  Of 
these,  perhaps  half  a dozen  were  by  then  fairly  competent  cryptanalysts,  50 
were  beginning  to  get  the  feel  of  the  work,  and  the  remainder  were  clerks. 
Work  went  on  round  the  clock  in  the  air-conditioned  basement,  but  the  unit 
was  woefully  understaffed. 

Rochefort  virtually  lived  in  that  cellar  for  the  first  three  months.  He  super- 
vised the  entire  operation — interception,  traffic  analysis,  cryptanalysis,  trans- 
lation. Dyer,  his  immediate  subordinate,  was  in  charge  of  the  cryptanalytic 
section.  A slender  man  just  turning  40,  with  a mild,  friendly  personality  but  a 
tough  and  unrelenting  mind,  Dyer  had  come  to  the  Islands  in  1936  and  had 
begun  cryptanalytical  work  largely  on  his  own  initiative.  He  had  become 
interested  in  the  field  soon  after  his  graduation  from  Annapolis  in  1924. 
Assigned  to  New  Mexico  as  an  assistant  radio  officer,  he  began  doing  the 
cryptograms  in  the  naval  communications  bulletins,  which  intrigued  him, 
and  then  read  Friedman’s  Elements  of  Cryptanalysis,  which  hooked  him.  In 
1931,  he  succeeded  Safford  as  head  of  the  Research  Desk  in  the  Code  and 
Signal  Section  of  Naval  Communications,  commanding  the  entire  U.S.  Navy 
cryptanalytical  group  of  four  people,  clerks  included. 

The  following  year.  Dyer  became  the  father  of  machine  cryptanalysis  when 
he  installed  I.B.M.  machines  to  speed  up  solution.  (The  Army  did  not  begin 
using  the  machines  for  cryptology  until  1936.)  In  1937,  after  he  had  been  in 
Hawaii  for  a year,  the  Navy  sent  some  I.B.M.  machines  out  to  him  and  as- 
signed him  a yeoman  to  expand,  in  a modest  way,  the  cryptanalysis  that  he  had 
been  doing.  Those  machines  were  his  baby.  While  other  cryptanalysts  used

that  Mauborgne  and  Kunze  both  play  the  violin  at  least  passably,  and  that  Hitchings  taught 
music.

pencil  and  paper  to  test  assumptions,  Dyer  tried  them  out  directly  on  the 
machines — and  worked  more  quickly  that  way  than  he  could  have  by  hand. 
He  stayed  in  cryptanalysis  all  during  the  war,  winning  the  Distinguished 
Service  Medal,  and  even  afterward,  rising  to  a captaincy.  On  his  retirement 
from  the  service  in  1955,  he  started  teaching  mathematics  at  the  University  of 
Maryland. 

His  chief  assistant  was  Wright,  who  handed  out  the  work  that  Dyer  wanted 
done  and  then  pitched  in  himself.  In  1929,  three  years  after  he  graduated  from 
Annapolis,  he  found  himself  with  his  crew  on  a rifle  range  shared  by  Safford, 
a fellow  officer  in  a destroyer  division.  Like  Dyer,  he  had  solved  the  ciphers  in 
the  communications  bulletins,  and  Safford,  in  a sales  campaign  that  began  to 
the  crack  of  musketry,  convinced  him  that  he  should  specialize  in  cryptology. 
But  it  was  not  until  June  of  1933  that  Wright  began  his  first  tour  in  communi- 
cations. Sea  duty  alternated  with  cryptologic  work  until,  in  March  of  1941, 
he  went  to  Pearl  Harbor  with  Admiral  Kimmel  as  the  cryptanalyst  in  a fleet 
security  unit.  He  immediately  began  working  with  the  Combat  Intelligence 
Unit  and  in  February  of  1942  was  formally  transferred  to  it.  He  was  then  39, 
a broad-shouldered  redhead  with  craggy  features  and  big  hands  whose  strong 
resemblance  to  a tugboat  captain — his  nickname  is  “Ham” — belies  his  gentle 
manner  and  his  courtesy.  He  too  remained  in  cryptology  throughout  the  war, 
winning  the  Legion  of  Merit;  like  Dyer  he  stayed  in  it  afterwards,  winning  a 
gold  star  to  his  Legion  of  Merit.  He  retired  in  1957. 

With  the  entrance  of  the  Rochefort  group  into  the  fray  against  JN25b,  the 
three  Allied  cryptanalytic  units  in  the  Pacific  and  op-20-g  in  Washington  began 
working  in  the  closest  possible  cooperation.  Positive  or  tentative  codegroup 
recoveries  were  flashed  from  unit  to  unit  via  the  copek  channel  for  magic. 
Each  unit  intercepted  messages  that  the  others  might  not  have  picked  up,  and 
so  could  make  new  assumptions  or  confirm  or  disprove  old  ones.  Washington, 
which  had  the  most  equipment  and  the  largest  staff,  seems  to  have  led  in  the 
work  of  stripping  the  additive  groups.  The  Singapore  and  the  Philippines  units 
had  made  the  difficult  initial  entries,  but  their  work  was  interrupted  when  the 
British  had  to  move  to  Colombo  and  Fabian  was  evacuated  by  submarine 
from  Corregidor  in  February,  1942,  several  weeks  before  MacArthur.  Aside 
from  a few  such  generalized  observations,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  say  which 
group,  much  less  which  individual,  deserves  the  major  share  of  credit  for 
solving  the  edition  of  the  fleet  cryptographic  system  then  in  force.  Collabora- 
tion was  too  intimate.  A possibility  raised  in  a discussion  between  Dyer  and 
Wright  might  be  developed  into  a probability  by  a check  of  messages  in 
Washington  and  verified  by  a new  intercept  at  Colombo. 

Meanwhile,  the  Japanese — who  had  no  suspicion  of  all  this  activity — felt 
a vague  unease  at  the  extreme  length  of  service  of  this  code.  A new  edition, 
which  would  be  called  jn25c  by  the  Americans  but  was  called  the  Naval  Code 
Book  d by  the  Japanese,  was  to  be  placed  in  service  April  1.  But  administra- 
tive confusion  in  the  Navy  libraries,  which  had  custody  of  the  codebooks,  plus

difficulties  in  physically  distributing  the  books  by  destroyer  and  airplane  to 
moving  ships  and  widely  dispersed  installations,  forced  a postponement  to 
May  1.  Consequently,  the  American  cryptanalysts  could  tunnel  ever  more 
deeply  into  JN25b. 

Gradually  the  isolated  fragments  of  plaintext  that  they  were  recovering 
grew  denser,  enlarged,  touched,  made  sense.  Parts  remained  unread,  but  the 
large  patches  of  coherence  offered  clues  to  Japanese  thoughts  and  plans.  Hence 
it  was  that  by  April  17  the  cryptanalysts  smoked  out  the  gist  of  the  Japanese 
plan  to  seize  Port  Moresby  and  threaten  Australia.  The  new  Commander  in 
Chief  of  the  Pacific  Fleet,  Admiral  Chester  W.  Nimitz,  dispatched  two  car- 
riers, Lexington  and  Yorktown,  to  spoil  it. 

This  task  force,  commanded  by  Rear  Admiral  Frank  Jack  Fletcher,  began 
cruising  the  lovely  waters  of  the  Coral  Sea  off  the  northeast  coast  of  Australia 
in  search  of  the  enemy.  At  8: 15  a.m.  May  7 a message  from  a Yorktown  search 
plane  was  decoded  as  reporting  the  discovery  of  “two  carriers  and  four  heavy 
cruisers”  175  miles  northwest  of  the  American  force.  Fletcher  thought  that 
this  was  the  main  Japanese  force  covering  the  amphibious  landing  and  flew 
off  two  deckloads  of  planes  to  attack  it.  When  the  search  pilot  returned,  it  was 
discovered  that  the  “two  carriers  and  four  heavy  cruisers”  had  resulted  from 
a disarrangement  of  his  codepad;  they  should  have  been  reported  as  “two 
heavy  cruisers  and  two  destroyers.”  But  another  contact  report  alerted  the 
fliers  to  the  presence  nearby  of  the  landing  force  itself,  escorted  by  the  light 
carrier  Shoho.  They  swarmed  over  Shoho  and  sank  it  in  ten  minutes — a record 
for  the  war.  “Scratch  one  flattop!”  exulted  one  pilot.  The  transports,  shorn 
of  their  air  cover,  retired  to  the  northward.  This  accidental  attack  on  the 
wrong  force  thwarted  the  main  Japanese  objective  and,  since  the  transports 
never  again  entered  the  Coral  Sea,  lifted  the  threat  of  invasion  from  Australia. 

Fletcher  could  hardly  foresee  this,  however,  and  next  day  he  located  the 
main  Japanese  force  of  two  big  carriers  and  attacked  them  at  the  same  time 
that  they  spotted  and  attacked  him.  It  was  the  first  naval  battle  in  history 
which  was  fought  entirely  by  air  and  in  which  the  opposing  ships  never  even 
sighted  each  other.  One  Japanese  carrier  was  put  out  of  action;  the  other  had 
its  flight  deck  bent  so  that  it  could  not  recover  all  its  planes,  many  of  which 
had  to  be  jettisoned.  But  Yorktown  was  scarred  and  the  beloved  Lexington  so 
badly  damaged  that,  after  futile  attempts  to  save  her,  she  had  to  be  torpedoed 
by  an  American  destroyer.  Though  this  gave  the  Japanese  a tactical  victory 
in  the  Coral  Sea,  they  had  lost  strategically.  More  important,  their  two  dam- 
aged carriers  would  not  be  present  at  the  Midway  battle.  For  the  check  at  the 
Coral  Sea  had  not  altered  Japan’s  grandiose  plans  for  winning  the  war  against 
America. 

During  these  hectic  spring  days,  the  cryptanalysts  strained  under  high 
pressure.  Rochefort  and  Dyer  alternated  12  hours  on,  12  hours  off.  Speed  was 
emphasized.  As  the  meaning  of  a codegroup  became  known  in  the  Combat 
Intelligence  Unit,  whether  through  its  own  efforts  or  by  a copek  message  from 


566  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

another  unit,  the  codegroup  and  its  meaning  were  punched  on  an  I.B.M.  card 
and  stored  in  the  machine.  When  an  intercept  came  in,  a clerk  would  punch  its 
codegroups  on  I.B.M.  cards  and  feed  them  in.  The  machine  automatically  made 
the  run  of  repeated  subtractions  and  the  check  of  its  mechanized  difference 
“books”  necessary  to  find  the  identical  remainders,  and  then,  with  human 
guidance,  the  runs  to  reconstruct  the  relative  additive  sequence,  correct  it  to 
the  absolute  sequence,  and  strip  it  from  the  encicode  message.  The  machine 
would  then  compare  the  placode  groups  with  the  decode  cards  in  its  storage 
and  print  out  the  plaintext  for  whatever  decode  cards  it  had.  Presumably  it 
would  also  print  out  the  various  possibilities  in  the  case  of  garbled  or  partial 
codegroups.  It  could  also  make  frequency  counts  and  contact  counts  and  on 
command  could  disgorge  a desired  set  of  statistics — all  codegroups  preceding 
and  following  a given  codegroup,  for  example.  Head  of  the  I.B.M.  room, 
which  was  constantly  being  enlarged,  was  Lieutenant  Commander  Jack  S. 
Holtwick,  Jr.,  a 1927  Annapolis  graduate  who  had  done  cryptologic  work  at 
the  Navy  Department,  the  16th  Naval  District,  and  the  Asiatic  Fleet  from 
1934  to  1939;  he  had  reported  to  the  Hawaiian  unit  in  June  of  1940. 

Not  every  cryptogram  was  decrypted.  Japanese  traffic  was  too  heavy  for 
the  undermanned  Combat  Intelligence  Unit.  All  major  and  most  minor 
Japanese  fleet  circuits  were  monitored,  and  the  messages  that  were  driven 
down  by  car  from  the  intercept  stations  were  scrutinized  by  traffic  analysts. 
From  such  indications  as  the  length  of  a message,  its  originator,  the  time  of 
day  at  which  it  was  sent,  the  circuit  used,  the  addressees,  and  stereotypes  in  the 
text  of  the  cryptogram  itself,  plus  an  intuitive  “feel”  based  on  day-in,  day-out 
listening-in  to  Japanese  communications,  these  “scanners”  could  pick  out  the 
important  messages.  The  cryptanalysts  concentrated  on  these,  filling  in 
missing  additives  and  conjecturing  the  meaning  of  new  codegroups.  They 
seldom  read  messages  “solid”;  even  the  translators — who  were  half  crypt- 
analysts— did  not  fill  in  all  the  holes. 

As  these  translations  were  written  up.  Lieutenant  Commander  W.  J. 
(Jasper)  Holmes  brought  them,  blank  spots  and  all,  together  with  some  that 
were  very  sketchy  indeed,  to  Nimitz’  chief  of  staff,  Rear  Admiral  Milo  F. 
Draemel,  who  took  the  important  ones  in  to  Nimitz  himself.  Holmes  had 
retired  in  1936  with  an  arthritic  back  but  had  returned  to  active  service  after 
Pearl  Harbor.  He  was  a good  enough  writer  to  have  sold  several  pieces  on 
naval  subjects  to  The  Saturday  Evening  Post , the  toughest  magazine  market 
in  America,  and  he  used  this  literary  ability  in  collaborating  with  the  fleet 
intelligence  officer  in  pulling  together  information  from  sightings  by  U.S. 
submarines,  traffic  analysis,  and  comparison  of  many  intercepts  into  an 
intelligence  compendium  that  went  to  the  higher-ups. 

On  May  5,*  Imperial  General  Headquarters  issued  Navy  Order  18: 
“Commander  in  Chief  Combined  Fleet  will,  in  cooperation  with  the  Army,

invade  and  occupy  strategic  points  in  the  Western  Aleutians  and  Midway 
Island.”  Wireless  traffic  subtly  changed  its  character.  More  than  200  ships 
would  take  part  in  the  operation,  and  though  most  were  already  in  the  Inland 
Sea,  many  of  the  carriers,  battleships,  submarines,  minesweepers,  transports, 
and  supply  vessels  had  to  be  summoned  from  missions  at  sea.  Some  had  to  be 
refitted,  and  messages  crackled  to  and  from  the  naval  base  at  Kure.  The 
magnitude  of  the  supply  problem  alone  was  indicated  by  the  fact  that  this  one 
operation  would  consume  more  fuel  and  cover  a greater  mileage  than  the 
entire  Japanese  Navy  had  done  in  any  previous  peacetime  year.  The  battle 
preparations  called  for  the  ships  to  assemble  in  Hiroshima  Bay  and  then  to 
sortie  in  five  main  forces  over  a four-day  period  according  to  a precisely 
calculated  schedule.  The  directives,  queries,  and  responses  involved  in  organ- 
izing so  complex  an  operation  filled  the  airwaves.  Coded  messages  streamed 
out  of  Yamamoto’s  headquarters  aboard  Yamato,  the  world’s  largest  battle- 
ship. And  not  only  the  legitimate  recipients  were  reading  them. 

For  the  effective  date  of  the  new  edition  of  the  fleet  cryptographic  system, 
whch  had  been  postponed  once  from  April  1 to  May  1,  had  to  be  again  set 
back  another  month,  to  June  1.  Perhaps  the  very  extent  of  the  Japanese  con- 
quests defeated  their  distribution  efforts.  These  may  not  have  been  very 
energetic  in  any  case,  for  the  Japanese,  while  paying  lip  service  to  the  need  for 
communication  security,  seemed  to  believe,  on  the  evidence  of  their  military 
successes,  that  their  codes  were  not  being  broken  and  that  timeliness  in  their 
replacement  was  not  really  necessary.  By  early  May,  Allied  cryptanalysts, 
who  had  recovered  about  a third  of  the  JN25b  lexicon,  could  read  about  90 
per  cent  of  an  ordinary  cryptogram  (because  the  recovered  codegroups  were 
the  most  frequently  used).  Had  Japan  changed  her  main  naval  code  on 
May  1 as  scheduled,  she  would  have  blacked  out  Allied  cryptanalysts  for  at 
least  several  weeks — weeks  that,  as  it  turned  out,  were  to  be  crucial  to 
history. 

Her  failure  to  do  so  meant  that  she  was  masking  her  Midway  preparation 
messages  behind  a cryptographic  smoke  screen  that  American  cryptanalysts 
had  almost  entirely  blown  away.  And  as  solutions  of  these  messages  drifted 
into  Nimitz’  office  in  the  first  weeks  of  May,  that  old  sea  dog  scented  a major 
offensive.  Hastily,  he  recalled  carriers  Hornet  and  Enterprise,  which  had  headed 
for  the  Coral  Sea  after  launching  Jimmy  Doolittle’s  raid  on  Tokyo,  and  York- 
town,  to  be  ready  for  any  eventuality.  But  what  eventualities  were  possible? 
The  Fleet  Intelligence  Summary  of  May  15  warned  of  an  enemy  raid  or 
seizure  of  Dutch  Harbor  in  the  Aleutians  some  time  between  May  30  and 
June  10.  This  was  almost  certainly  a diversionary  move.  But  where  would  the 
main  Japanese  attack  fall — and  when?  There  was  no  clear-cut  answer. 
Several  Japanese  strategies  appeared  possible.  Nimitz  himself  thought  Mid- 
way was  the  target,  but  in  Washington  Admiral  Ernest  J.  King,  Chief  of 
Naval  Operations,  who  was  working  from  essentially  the  same  information, 
concluded  that  Oahu  was.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Yamamoto  was  well  aware  of  the  inestimable  advantage  of  surprise,  that 
element  of  warfare  which  so  often  decides  the  course  of  battle.  He  felt  con- 
fident that  the  United  States,  unable  to  defend  all  points,  would  have  to 
counterattack  at  a time  and  place  governed  by  the  Japanese  moves,  giving 
Yamamoto  control  of  every  situation.  In  addition  to  this  tactical  initiative, 
he  had  an  overwhelming  preponderance  of  forces.  To  his  11  battleships,  5 
carriers,  16  cruisers,  and  49  destroyers,  Nimitz  could  oppose  no  battleships 
and  only  3 carriers,  8 cruisers,  and  14  destroyers. 

On  May  20,  Yamamoto  issued  an  operations  order  that  spelled  out  in 
detail  the  tactics  to  be  used  in  the  Midway  assault.  It  was  to  begin  on  June  3 
with  a diversionary  attack  on  the  Aleutians.  With  Nimitz’  forces  thus  pulled 
off  balance,  the  softening-up  would  begin  on  the  Midway  defenders,  to  be 
followed  on  June  6 by  a dawn  assault.  When  the  Pacific  Fleet  either  hurried 
south  from  the  Aleutians  or  sallied  forth  from  Pearl  Harbor  to  defend  Mid- 
way, the  numerically  superior  bombers  and  torpedo  planes  of  the  Japanese 
force  would  cripple  it.  Then  Yamamoto’s  battleships  and  heavy  cruisers 
would  move  up  to  sink  its  remnants  by  gunfire.  The  work  of  December  7 
would  be  completed;  a Japanese  Midway  would  rule  the  Pacific,  threatening 
Hawaii  itself ; and  the  war  would  be  as  good  as  won. 

Unknown  to  Yamamoto,  his  order  was  also  picked  up  by  the  Allied  listen- 
ing posts  that  ringed  the  Pacific.  Its  extreme  length  indicated  its  importance, 
and  Fabian’s  unit,  by  this  time  in  Melbourne,  may  have  first  suggested  that  it 
might  be  an  operations  order.  But  the  Hawaii  unit  put  out  the  first  fragmen- 
tary solution.  The  I.B.M.  apparatus  rapped  it  out  in  a mechanical  cryptanalysis 
for  as  much  of  the  intercept  as  codegroups  and  additives  were  available  in 
storage.  Only  about  10  to  15  per  cent  of  the  message  was  lacking,  and  the  unit 
began  a massive  effort  to  fill  in  these  holes.  This  task  lasted  more  than  a week. 
Dyer  pushed  cards  through  the  clacking  machines.  The  fledgling  cryptanalysts 
drove  pencils  furiously  across  sheet  after  sheet  of  paper.  The  clerks  scurried 
among  the  desks.  Overworked  language  officers  sucked  in  Japanese  through 
their  eyes  and  spouted  English  at  their  fingertips.  Gradually  additives  were 
recovered  and  stripped  and  the  plaintext  of  the  uncovered  codegroups  was 
revealed  or  inserted.  As  each  new  portion  came  to  light,  adding  another  scrap 
of  information,  it  was  rushed  upstairs  to  Jasper  Holmes.  He  would  write  it 
into  its  proper  place  in  the  picture  and  send  it  along  to  Commander  Edwin  T. 
Layton,  the  fleet  intelligence  officer,  for  transmission  to  Draemel  and  Nimitz. 
The  operations  order  was  so  long  and  so  detailed  that  dozens  of  such  frag- 
ments rustled  across  the  commander’s  desk. 

Still  in  doubt,  however,  were  its  most  important  parts:  the  dates,  the 
times,  and  the  places  of  the  various  operations.  The  date-time  information 
had  been  superenciphered  in  what  appeared  to  be  a polyalphabetic  system. 
This  had  never  been  solved  because  it  had  been  observed  only  three  times 
before,  and  one  occasion  had  a garble  that  threw  sand  in  the  gears  of  every 
attempted  reconstruction.  The  cryptanalysts  had  considered  that  they  could 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


569 


not  do  anything  with  this,  and  so,  rather  than  waste  a man  on  a fruitless  en- 
deavor, all  hands  concentrated  on  the  body  of  the  message.  Additives  and 
codegroups  recovered  there  would  be  of  value  in  later  solutions.  Consequently, 
the  question  of  when  was  left  to  other  branches  of  naval  intelligence,  which 
applied  ship  speeds  and  similar  data  to  estimate  the  date  and  time  for  the 
attack. 

The  question  of  where  was  answered  fairly  quickly  by  the  Combat  Intelli- 
gence Unit.  The  Japanese  indicated  geographic  locations  by  maps  with  co- 
ordinates in  code;  they  called  these  their  chi-he  systems,  and  they  served  as 
much  to  avoid  error  in  transliterating  kata  kana  as  to  conceal.  The  crypt- 
analysts had  partly  recovered  one  such  map;  they  knew  the  designators  for 
Pearl  Harbor,  for  example.  Several  weeks  earlier,  they  had  discovered  the 
code  coordinates  af  in  a message  sent  from  two  scout  planes  over  Midway. 
Context  suggested  that  af  meant  Midway.  When  they  checked  this  against 
their  partially  solved  map  grid,  they  found  that  a’s  representing  one  co- 
ordinate of  Midway’s  position  and  f’s  representing  the  other  fit  into  it  per- 
fectly. So  when  they  saw  that  af  was  the  codegroup  for  the  locus  of  the  main 
attack,  they  felt  quite  sure  that  Midway  was  the  target. 

But  the  top  brass  squinted  at  this  identification.  On  it  rode  the  very 
existence  of  the  American  fleet  and  the  future  course  of  the  whole  Pacific  war. 
They  demanded  confirmation. 

Rochefort  decided  to  trick  the  Japanese  into  giving  him  the  proof.  He 
cooked  up  the  idea  of  having  the  Midway  garrison  broadcast  a distinctive 
plain  language  message  which  would  presumably  be  picked  up  by  Japanese 
monitors.  Their  coded  report  would  be  intercepted  and  solved  by  Americans, 
and  the  geographic  indicator  that  they  used  in  this  telltale  dispatch  would  have 
to  mean  Midway.  Layton  liked  the  idea,  and  the  two  men  drafted  a message 
in  which  Midway  reported  that  its  fresh-water  distillation  plant  had  broken 
down.  They  cabled  it  to  the  atoll  with  an  order  to  radio  it  back  to  Pearl  in 
clear.  Midway  complied.  The  cryptanalysts  waited.  Two  days  later  there  ap- 
peared in  the  harvest  of  Japanese  intercepts  one  stating  that  af  was  short  of 
fresh  water. 

By  about  Wednesday,  May  27,  Nimitz  knew  almost  as  much  about  the 
Midway  operation  as  many  of  the  captains  of  Japanese  warships  who  were 
to  take  part  in  it.  In  all  respects  but  one  his  information  was  solid:  it  had 
come  from  the  Japanese  themselves  and  had  even  been  verified.  The  one  point 
was  the  when.  His  intelligence  staff  had  erected  an  elaborate  scaffolding  of 
estimates,  deductions,  probabilities,  and  predictions  to  date  the  operation  as 
beginning  against  Midway  June  3.  The  reasoning  was  shrewd,  but  its  hypo- 
thetical framework  could  hardly  have  comforted  Nimitz  in  so  weighty  a 
matter  as  much  as  the  repeatedly  confirmed  perceptions  of  the  cryptanalysts. 

Meanwhile,  in  the  basement  office,  nearly  everything  that  could  be  done 
to  the  body  of  the  Yamamoto  operations  order  had  been  done.  Hardly  any 
gaps  remained,  and  only  an  occasional  paper  went  upstairs.  Intercept

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


importance  had  fallen  off  with  the  sortie  of  the  Japanese  fleet  under  radio 
silence.  Late  one  afternoon  in  this  comparative  lull,  Lieutenant  Commander 
Joseph  Finnegan,  a 1929  Annapolis  graduate  who  had  served  as  a language 
officer  in  Japan  from  1934  to  1937,  brought  the  section  with  the  untouched 
internal  date-time  cipher  over  to  Wright. 

“Ham,”  he  said,  “we’re  stuck  on  the  date  and  time.” 

Wright  had  already  stood  his  12-hour  watch  and  was  about  to  go  home 
before  returning  in  12  hours  for  another.  Instead,  he  went  with  Finnegan  to 
an  empty  desk  in  the  traffic  analysis  section.  Finnegan  gave  him  the  three 
previous  uses  of  the  cipher — one  of  them  in  a message  that  had  led  to  the 
Coral  Sea  battle,  another  the  garbled  text.  Wright  put  four  people  on  a search 
for  other  instances  of  the  cipher,  and  he  and  Finnegan  set  to  work.  For  a good 
while  the  flaw  in  the  one  corrupt  cryptogram  frustrated  their  efforts,  but  as 
the  night  wore  on  Wright  worked  it  out.  He  discovered  that  the  date-and-time 
cipher  comprised  a polyalphabetic  with  independent  mixed-cipher  alphabets 
and  with  the  exterior  plain  and  key  alphabets  in  two  different  systems  of 
Japanese  syllabic  writing — one  the  older,  formal  kata  kana,  the  other  the 
cursive  hira  gana.  Each  has  47  syllables,  making  the  polyalphabetic  tableau  a 
gigantic  one  of  2,209  cells,  more  than  three  times  as  extensive  as  the  ordinary 
Vigenere  tableau  of  676  cells. 

Nevertheless,  by  about  5:30  the  next  morning  he  had  a solution.  His 
inability  to  apply  symmetry  of  position  to  the  unrelated  alphabets  gave  it  a 
certain  amount  of  slack,  but  he  regarded  it  as  essentially  sound.  He  showed 
it  to  Rochefort.  That  expert  noted  the  weak  spots  and  said  to  Wright  in  mock 
rebuke: 

“I  can’t  send  this  out.” 

“If  you  don’t,”  Wright  replied  firmly,  “I  will.” 

Rochefort  laughed.  He  had  only  been  testing  Wright’s  faith  in  the  solution, 
and  Wright  knew  it.  “Go  ahead,”  he  said. 

Wright  took  it  up  to  communications  for  transmission  via  the  copek 
channel  to  the  other  communications  intelligence  units.  He  then  headed  once 
again  for  home,  and  on  the  way  saw  Layton  about  7:45  and  told  him  about 
it.  Within  hours,  Nimitz  knew  that  the  Japanese  had  ordered  that  the  Midway 
operation  was  to  commence  June  2 against  the  Aleutians  and  June  3 against 
the  atoll.  His  intelligence  staff  had  forecast  correctly — but  what  a relief  it  was 
to  know  for  sure,  to  work  on  fact  instead  of  on  theory. 

By  this  time — the  middle  of  the  week  before  the  attack  was  due — Enterprise 
and  Hornet  had  reached  Pearl  after  racing  up  from  the  southwest  Yorktown 
limped  in  the  next  day,  her  bowels  torn  by  a Coral  Sea  bomb.  Peacetime 
structural  repairs  would  have  taken  90  days;  now  the  Navy  yard,  goaded  by 
Nimitz,  who  knew  how  soon  the  hammer  would  fall,  did  the  impossible  and 
patched  her  up  in  two.  On  the  27th,  Nimitz  had  issued  his  Operation  Plan 
29-42,  stating  that  “The  enemy  is  expected  to  attempt  the  capture  of  Midway 
in  the  near  future"  and  setting  fcth  his  dispositions  for  the  counterattack. 


The  Scrutable  Orientals

He  ordered  his  carriers  to  a position  codenamed  point  luck  about  350 
miles  northeast  of  Midway.  Here,  on  Yamamoto’s  flank,  where  they  were  not 
likely  to  be  scouted,  they  were  to  await  his  advance.  Then,  with  the  advantage 
of  the  surprise  that  the  American  cryptanalysts  had  wrested  from  the  unsus- 
pecting Yamamoto,  they  were  to  spring  on  him,  repulse  the  Midway  invasion, 
wreak  havoc  on  his  carriers,  and  finally  cheat  him  of  the  naval  victory  on 
which  his  war-winning  strategy  depended. 

The  three  carriers  took  up  station  at  point  luck  on  June  2.  By  then  the 
Japanese  had  succeeded  in  effecting  their  long-desired  code  change.  It  com- 
pletely blacked-out  the  cryptanalysts  of  the  Combat  Intelligence  Unit.  They 
began  chipping  away  at  what  they  called  jn25c,  but  they  got  only  a few  glim- 
mers of  light  before  edition  d came  into  force,  unexpectedly  soon,  in  August. 
Had  the  J une  change  been  made  in  April  as  the  Japanese  had  originally  wanted, 
the  cryptanalysts,  Dyer  said,  “could  not  have  gotten  back  in  in  time  to  do  any 
good.  May  1st  would  have  been  impossible.  Midway  was  therefore  a very  close 
thing.”  But  the  June  change  did  not  affect  the  course  of  events,  since  all  plans 
had  been  made  and  the  great  operation  had  already  been  set  in  motion. 

According  to  program,  the  Japanese  Aleutian  force  struck  first.  Nimitz 
had  sent  a North  Pacific  Force  of  cruisers  and  destroyers  to  protect  his  flank. 
Like  some  other  officers,  its  commander,  Rear  Admiral  Robert  A.  Theobald, 
suspected  that  the  Japanese  had  “planted”  the  information  on  which  U.S. 
intelligence  estimates  were  based.  They  were  probably  thinking  of  dummy 
radio  activity  to  fool  the  traffic  analysts,  for  Nimitz  never  mentioned  the 
supersecret  cryptanalytic  successes  to  his  force  commanders — not  even  in  the 
briefings  just  before  the  battle.  The  suspicions  of  the  doubters  may  have  been 
reinforced  by  an  intercepted  plaintext  request  of  a Japanese  Army  officer  that 
all  mail  for  his  unit  be  addressed  to  Midway  after  June  5;  as  General  Marshall 
later  said,  “that  seemed  a little  bit  too  thick.”  Furthermore,  Nimitz  himself 
warned  of  Japanese  trickery  when  arranging  for  identification  by  radio  in  his 
Operation  Plan  29-42:  “The  Japanese  are  adept  at  the  practice  of  deception. 
Have  authenticators  ready  for  use  when  needed.  Small  craft  and  aircraft 
except  patrol  planes  use  two  alternate  letters  from  the  expression:  ‘Farmer  in 
the  dell.’  Example:  re  or  el  or  nh.”  Hence  Theobald  disbelieved  the  intelli- 
gence supplied  him  that  the  Japanese  were  going  just  to  bombard  Dutch 
Harbor  but  to  seize  Attu  and  Kiska.  He  deployed  his  force  to  prevent  what  he 
was  convinced  would  be  an  invasion  of  Dutch  Harbor.  Unfortunately,  this 
disposition  deprived  him  of  any  opportunity  to  fight  when,  on  the  morning 
of  June  3,  right  on  schedule,  the  Japanese  did  just  what  the  cryptanalysts  had 
said  they  would  do  and  bombed  Dutch  Harbor,  inflicting  considerable  dam- 
age. They  escaped  unmolested. 

The  same  morning  an  American  search  plane  from  Midway  spotted  the 
enemy.  It  was  the  troop-carrying  invasion  force,  which  Midway-based  planes 
promptly  but  ineffectually  attacked.  The  main  striking  force  of  four  big 
carriers — Akagi,  Kaga,  Hiryu,  and  Soryu,  veterans  of  the  Pearl  Harbor 


572

attack — remained  hidden  by  clouds  until  the  next  morning,  June  4.  Again  a 
Midway  scout  discovered  the  vessels.  The  American  carriers  sped  toward 
them  to  launch  planes  for  an  attack.  Meanwhile,  American  bombers  from 
Midway  and  Japanese  bombers  from  the  carriers  were  mounting  simultaneous 
attacks.  Neither  did  much  damage.  Returning  Japanese  planes  told  of  the 
need  for  further  attacks. 

So  far  the  Japanese  had  sighted  no  American  ships.  They  had  not  been 
diligently  looking  for  them  because,  according  to  their  expectations,  no  major 
enemy  forces  should  have  been  in  the  vicinity:  they  should  have  been  in  Pearl, 
waiting  to  find  out  where  the  Japanese  would  strike.  Admiral  Chuichi  Nagumo 
therefore  struck  below  the  93  planes  he  had  prudently  held  to  counter  even 
the  highly  unlikely  enemy  naval  attack  and  ordered  them  rearmed  for  land 
bombardment.  Thirteen  minutes  later  he  was  dumfounded  to  receive  a report 
of  the  sighting  of  enemy  ships  to  the  northeast.  What  should  he  do?  For  a 
precious  quarter  of  an  hour  he  mulled  it  over.  Finally  he  canceled  his  order 
and  directed  the  planes  readied  to  attack  ships.  The  incendiary  and  fragmen- 
tation bombs  that  the  crews  had  just  sweated  into  the  bomb  bays  had  to  be 
replaced  with  the  original  torpedoes  and  armor-piercing  bombs.  Before  this 
work  was  completed,  his  airplanes  began  returning  from  Midway,  and  his 
carriers  had  to  recover  these  before  launching  the  others. 

It  was  at  this  most  vulnerable  of  moments — with  all  planes  aboard,  with 
fueling  in  process  and  bombs  and  ammunition  stacked  in  the  open  on  the 
hangar  and  flight  decks — that  American  planes  attacked.  Three  waves  of 
torpedo-bombers,  one  each  from  Hornet,  Enterprise,  and  Yorktown,  swept  in, 
suffered  heavy  losses  under  Zero  attacks  or  antiaircraft  fire,  and  scored  not  a 
single  hit.  The  last  plane  zoomed  away  at  10:24  a.m.  This  moment  marked 
the  high  tide  of  Japan’s  fortunes  in  World  War  II.  Jubilant  officers  cheered 
what  they  thought  was  victory  at  Midway,  and  in  the  war.  Within  six  minutes, 
the  tide  was  ebbing. 

Dive-bombers  from  Enterprise  screamed  down  on  Akagi,  Kaga,  and  Soryu. 
One  hit  set  off  Akagi' s torpedo  storage,  another  exploded  amid  planes  being 
rearmed  on  her  flight  deck;  flames  swept  her,  and  within  24  hours  she  had 
been  sunk.  Kaga  took  four  hits  in  rapid  succession  and  sank  that  evening. 
Yorktown  dive-bombers  pummeled  Soryu  with  three  half-ton  bombs;  within 
20  minutes  she  had  to  be  abandoned,  and  a few  hours  later  was  torpedoed  by 
an  American  submarine.  The  work  of  December  7 had  not  been  completed, 
but  avenged. 

The  rest  was  anticlimax.  Later  in  the  day  Hiryu  was  sunk,  and  the  Japanese 
in  turn  got  Yorktown.  Yamamoto  next  day  realized  that  he  was  beaten.  He 
called  off  the  invasion  of  Midway  and  retreated,  keeping  close  to  his  cabin  on 
the  homeward  voyage.  The  samurai  chieftains  canceled  plans  for  further 
advances  and  shifted  from  offense  to  defense.  The  failure  to  destroy  the 
American  Navy  knocked  the  keystone  from  Yamamoto’s  strategy,  and  his 
words  to  Prince  Konoye  before  the  war  haunted  him:  “I  must  also  tell  you 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


573 


that,  should  the  war  be  prolonged  for  two  or  three  years,  I have  no  confidence 
in  our  ultimate  victory.”  And  not  only  did  American  industrial  strength  rise 
up  like  a specter.  Japan’s  lack  of  it  meant  that  she  would  never  recover  from 
the  loss  of  four  big  carriers.  The  4th  of  June  had  doomed  her. 

“Midway  was  essentially  a victory  of  intelligence,”  Nimitz  has  written.  “In 
attempting  surprise,  the  Japanese  were  themselves  surprised.”  General  Mar- 
shall was  even  more  specific.  As  a result  of  cryptanalysis,  he  declared,  “We 
were  able  to  concentrate  our  limited  forces  to  meet  their  naval  advance  on 
Midway  when  otherwise  we  almost  certainly  would  have  been  some  3,000 
miles  out  of  place.”  The  surprise,  the  concentration,  were  engineered  days 
before  in  a basement  office  a thousand  miles  from  the  scene  of  the  action, 
where  the  solution  of  messages  in  jN25b  (abetted  by  the  recoveries  of  the  other 
cryptanalytic  units)  and  its  internal  time  and  place  ciphers  forged  effects  more 
crucial  to  the  course  of  history  than  any  other  solution  except  that  of  the 
Zimmermann  telegram.  The  codebreakers  of  the  Combat  Intelligence  Unit 
had  engrossed  the  fate  of  a nation.  They  had  determined  the  destinies  of  ships 
and  men.  They  had  turned  the  tide  of  a war.  They  had  caused  a Rising  Sun  to 
start  to  set. 

There  was  no  single  moment  when  the  Battle  of  Midway  was  suddenly  and 
decisively  won,  and  so  there  was  no  burst  of  wild  cheering  in  the  basement 
office.  The  cryptanalysts  reacted  prosaically.  The  unit  went  on  a watch  in 
three  instead  of  a watch  and  watch.  It  was  also  expanding  rapidly.  By  the 
next  year,  it  had  changed  its  name  to  Fleet  Radio  Unit,  Pacific  Fleet — frupac, 
in  the  Navy’s  interminable  list  of  acronyms.  Rochefort  had  departed  in 
October,  1942,  for  two  years  of  noncryptologic  duties.  He  was  replaced  by 
Captain  William  B.  Goggins,  44,  a 1919  Annapolis  graduate  with  long  com- 
munications experience.  Goggins,  who  had  been  wounded  in  the  Battle  of  the 
Java  Sea,  remained  as  head  of  frupac  to  January,  1945.  Dyer  continued  to 
head  cryptanalysis.  Eventually  frupac  comprised  a personnel  of  more  than 
1,000.  Much  of  the  work  was  done  in  the  new  Joint  Intelligence  Center, 
housed  in  a long  narrow  building  across  Midway  Drive  from  Nimitz  head- 
quarters perched  atop  a cliff  overlooking  Pearl  Harbor . F abian,  in  Melbourne, 
directed  a field  unit  similar  to  frupac.  He  was  on  the  staff  of  the  Com- 
mander in  Chief,  7th  Fleet,  which  was  attached  to  MacArthur’s  South  West 
Pacific  Area  command. 

frupac’s  growth  mirrored  that  of  all  American  cryptanalytic  agencies. 
This  expansion  compelled  op-20-G  to  reorganize  as  early  as  February,  1942. 
The  workload  had  become  too  heavy  for  one  man  (Safford).  The  outfit  was 
split  up  into  sections  for  its  three  major  cryptologic  functions : ( 1 ) the  develop- 
ment, production,  and  distribution  of  naval  cryptosystems,  headed  by  Safford ; 
(2)  policing  of  American  naval  communications  to  correct  and  prevent  security 
violations;  (3)  cryptanalysis,  headed  by  Commander  John  Redman.  In 
September  the  development  function  was  separated  from  the  production.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Safford  retained  control  of  the  development  work  until  the  end  of  the  war, 
devising  such  new  devices  as  call-sign  cipher  machines,  adapters  for  British 
and  other  cryptographic  devices,  and  off-line  equipment  for  automatic  opera- 
tion. About  June,  the  Navy  ceded  Japanese  diplomatic  solutions  to  the  Army, 
giving  over  its  files  as  well  as  its  purple  machine.  So  rapidly  was  the  workload 
expanding,  however,  that  this  diminution  of  its  responsibility  did  not  prevent 
the  cryptologic  branch  from  bursting  the  seams  of  its  Navy  Department 
building  offices.  In  1942,  it  moved  into  the  brick  buildings  of  a former  girls’ 
school  at  3801  Nebraska  Avenue,  at  the  corner  of  Massachusetts  Avenue,  in 
a quiet  section  of  northwest  Washington.  In  the  fall  of  1941,  about  700  persons, 
including  80  officers,  had  been  doing  communications  intelligence  in  the  entire 
Navy;  two  thirds  of  them  were  intercepting,  direction-finding,  or  training  for 
that  work;  the  others,  including  most  of  the  officers,  were  solving  and  trans- 
lating. By  the  end  of  the  war,  there  were  6,000. 

The  Army’s  growth  was  even  more  spectacular.  It  multiplied  its  communi- 
cations-intelligence  manpower  thirtyfold  from  its  strength  December  7,  1941, 
of  331 — 44  officers  and  137  enlisted  men  and  civilians  in  Washington,  and 
150  officers  and  men  in  the  field.  Ever-growing  requirements  quickly  dwarfed 
early  estimates,  such  as  the  one  early  in  1942  that  a staff  of  460  would  suffice, 
and  kept  up  a relentless  pressure  for  more  and  still  more  workers.  Yet  the 
agency  faced  stiff  competition  for  them  in  manpower-short  Washington. 
Moreover,  the  necessity  for  employees  to  be  of  unquestioned  loyalty  and 
trustworthiness,  because  of  the  sensitive  nature  of  cryptanalytic  results,  and 
the  importance  of  their  being  temperamentally  suited  to  the  highly  specialized 
nature  of  the  work,  greatly  reduced  the  number  of  prospects.  To  fill  its  needs, 
the  agency  launched  a series  of  vigorous  but  discreet  recruiting  drives.  It 
snatched  people  out  of  its  school  even  though  they  were  only  partially  trained : 
during  the  school's  entire  time  at  Fort  Monmouth,  New  Jersey,  not  one 
student  completed  the  full  48-week  course.  It  brought  in  members  of  the 
Women’s  Army  Corps — almost  1,500  of  them.  These  measures  enabled  the 
agency  to  grow  to  a strength  of  10,609  at  its  peak  on  June  1,  1945—5,565 
civilians,  4,428  enlisted  men  and  W.A.C.’s  and  796  officers.  (This  figure 
excludes  cryptologic  personnel  serving  under  theater  commanders  overseas.) 
Nevertheless,  the  personnel  supply  never  caught  up  to  the  demand.  In  April, 
1944,  for  example,  the  agency  had  more  than  1,000  civilian  positions  empty. 

But  its  growth  soon  made  more  space  necessary.  Like  the  Navy,  it  found 
a former  girls’  school  ideal  for  its  purposes.  During  the  summer  of  1942,  it 
moved  from  the  Munitions  Building  to  Arlington  Hall,  whose  brick  buildings 
stood  on  58  wooded  acres  fronting  on  Glebe  Road  in  Arlington,  Virginia, 
about  three  miles  from  downtown  Washington  and  away  from  the  eyes  of 
enemy  agents.  The  agency  soon  outgrew  even  this,  and  in  the  late  fall  of 
1942  began  expanding  into  Vint  Hill  Farms,  an  old  estate  in  the  Virginia 
horse  country  about  50  miles  from  Washington.  Giant  intercepting  towers 
and  half  a dozen  ugly  barracks-like  buildings  soon  disfigured  the  lovely 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


575 


Blue  Ridge  foothills,  and  here,  in  rooms  filled  with  desks  with  tilted  tops, 
most  of  the  Army’s  traffic  analysis  was  done.  In  addition,  the  agency  taught 
most  of  its  cryptology  here,  with  the  removal  of  its  school  from  Fort  Mon- 
mouth in  October,  1942. 

In  June  of  1942,  owing  to  a reorganization  in  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Signal 
Officer,  the  outfit  shed  its  old  name  of  Signal  Intelligence  Service  and  gained 
and  lost  three  new  ones  within  two  months.  Then  from  July,  1942,  to  July, 
1943,  it  was  called  the  Signal  Security  Service,  and  from  July,  1943,  to  the  end 
of  the  war,  the  Signal  Security  Agency.  Lieutenant  Colonel  Rex  Minckler, 
chief  since  before  Pearl  Harbor,  was  replaced  in  April,  1942,  by  Lieutenant 
Colonel  Frank  W.  Bullock.  In  February,  1943,  Lieutenant  Colonel  W. 
Preston  (Red)  Corderman,  tall,  husky,  quiet,  pleasant,  who  had  studied  and 
then  taught  in  the  S.I.S.  school  in  the  1930s,  became  chief.  He  remained  in 
the  post  to  the  end  of  the  war,  rising  to  a brigadier  general  in  June,  1945. 

Its  population  explosion  and  its  voluminous  output  strained  its  adminis- 
trative structure,  and  this  was  realigned  several  times.  As  of  Pearl  Harbor  it 
was  divided  into  four  sections:  the  a,  or  administrative;  the  b,  or  crypt- 
analytic; the  c,  or  cryptographic,  and  the  d,  or  laboratory. 

The  c,  or  cryptographic  section,  devised  hundreds  of  codes  and  ciphers 
during  the  war  and  produced  thousands  of  key  lists.  It  printed  5,000,000 
classified  documents,  some  running  to  many  pages  each,  and  distributed 
them  in  a carefully  guarded  manner  throughout  the  world,  accounting  for 
each  one.  It  tested  the  security  of  Army  cipher  machines  (mainly  Friedman’s 
m-134  sigaba)  by  attempting  to  solve  them — and  found  that  they  generally 
proved  impregnable.  It  supervised  the  mechanization  of  Army  cryptography 
— the  increasing  replacement  of  strip  cipher  and  m-209s  and  similar  slow 
systems  with  typewriter-keyboard  cipher  machines,  often  with  an  on-line 
capacity.  Only  such  mechanization  enabled  Army  cryptographers  to  keep  up 
with  the  ever-rising  flood  of  traffic:  the  23,000  codegroups  a day  that  the  5th 
Army  headquarters  processed  during  its  Sicily  campaign  strained  even  the 
machines  to  their  limit — and  by  the  time  that  army  was  marching  on  Rome, 
its  headquarters  was  handling  40,000  groups  a day.  Traffic  volume  passed 
belief : in  Hollandia,  a million  groups  a day  in  November,  1944;  at  the 
Army’s  European  Theater  of  Operations  headquarters  even  before  overlord, 
1,500,000  to  2,000,000  groups  a day,  or  the  equivalent  of  a shelf  of  20  average 
books.  The  biggest  message  center  of  all,  the  War  Department’s  in  Washing- 
ton, handled  its  peak  load  on  August  8,  1945:  nearly  9,500,000  words,  the 
equivalent  of  almost  one-tenth  the  total  of  French  intercepts  in  all  of  World 
War  I. 

In  August  of  1942,  subsection  6 (traffic)  of  the  cryptanalytic  section  was 
upgraded  to  an  e,  or  communications,  section,  to  disseminate  the  solutions  and 
to  send  directives  to  the  field  intercept  units.  In  December,  the  shop  of  the 
cryptographic  section  was  set  up  as  the  nucleus  of  the  f,  or  development, 
section,  for  cryptographic  equipment.  In  March  of  1943,  all  six  sections  were 


576 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


elevated  to  branches,  and  by  the  following  year  two  more  had  been  added : 
the  machine  and  the  information  and  liaison  branches.  The  Army  had  begun 
to  use  machines  for  cryptology  in  1936,  when  Hollerith  tabulating  machines 
facilitated  the  compiling  of  codes.  Their  cryptanalytic  potential  had  also 
been  noted  in  that  same  year.  By  Pearl  Harbor,  13  I.B.M.  machines  tended 
by  21  operators  were  working  on  S.I.S.  projects.  The  personnel-short  agency 
converted  as  many  tasks  as  possible  to  mechanical  operation,  and  the  g,  or 
machine,  branch  grew  to  enormous  proportions.  The  407  machines  and  1,275 
operators  that  it  had  by  the  spring  of  1945  handled  accounting  and  crypto- 
logic tasks  that  would  otherwise  have  required  the  hand  labor  of  impossible 
numbers  of  clerks. 

The  cryptanalytic  branch,  then  headed  by  Solomon  Kullback,  one  of  the 
three  original  cryptanalysts  hired  by  Friedman  in  1930,  was  much  the  largest, 
with  2,574  people  in  July  of  1944,  82  per  cent  working  on  Japanese  Army 
messages.  To  balance  the  agency  and  reduce  the  number  of  branch  chiefs 
reporting  to  its  commanding  officer,  the  agency  was  reorganized  the  follow- 
ing month  into  four  divisions:  intelligence,  which  did  traffic  analysis  and 
cryptanalysis;  security,  which  handled  cryptography  and  radio  counter- 
measures and  formulated  and  executed  policy  and  technical  doctrines; 
operating  services,  which  provided  services  for  the  intelligence  and  security 
divisions  and  ran  the  secret-ink  laboratory;  and  personnel  and  training. 

Though  this  set-up  held  until  the  war  ended,  operational  control  of  the 
agency  passed  on  December  15,  1944,  to  g-2,  the  military  intelligence  section 
of  the  War  Department  General  Staff,  which  was  the  agency’s  major  customer 
and  which,  as  such,  for  many  months  had  indirectly  guided  its  activities. 
The  Signal  Corps  merely  retained  administrative  control.  This  confusing 
arrangement — complicated  further  by  the  agency’s  having  both  staff  and 
command  functions — ended  in  August,  1945,  when  the  War  Department 
transferred  all  signal  intelligence  units  to  agency  control.  On  September  6, 
four  days  after  the  war  ended,  the  War  Department  ordered  the  creation 
within  g-2  of  a new  cryptologic  organization  by  merging  the  Signal 
Security  Agency,  the  field  cryptanalytic  units,  and  Signal  Corps  cryptography. 
This  was  the  Army  Security  Agency,  which  came  into  existence  September  15, 
1945. 

Throughout  the  war,  most  of  the  intercept  material  for  Signal  Security 
Agency  headquarters  was  supplied  by  the  2nd  Signal  Service  Battalion.  It  had 
been  created  as  the  2nd  Signal  Service  Company  on  January  1,  1939,  by 
Major  General  Joseph  Mauborgne,  the  chief  signal  officer,  out  of  the  1st 
Radio  Intelligence  Company  at  Fort  Monmouth,  plus  the  radio  intelligence 
detachments  of  signal  companies  in  the  Canal  Zone,  Fort  Sam  Houston, 
Texas,  the  Presidio,  San  Francisco,  Fort  Shafter,  Hawaii  and  Fort  McKinley, 
Philippine  Islands.  Commanding  its  101  enlisted  men  was  First  Lieutenant 
Earle  F.  Cooke.  It  grew  rapidly — in  October,  1939,  a detachment  under 
First  Lieutenant  Robert  E.  Schukraft  arrived  at  Fort  Hunt,  Virginia,  to 


The  Scrutable  Orientals

install  and  operate  a new  Army  intercept  station.  With  the  onset  of  war,  the 
imperative  demands  for  manpower  compelled  the  Army,  on  April  2,  1942,  to 
increase  the  company  to  battalion  strength.  Eventually  it  expanded  to  an 
enormously  oversized  company  of  5,000  men.  From  April,  1942,  to  the  end 
of  the  war,  its  commanding  officer  was  the  Signal  Security  Agency  chief. 
When  g-2  took  operational  control,  the  battalion  was  redesignated  the 
9420th  Technical  Service  Unit,  which  at  the  end  of  the  war  became  part  of 
the  Army  Security  Agency.  By  that  time,  the  original  four  radio  circuits  on 
which  it  was  sending  intercept  material  back  to  Washington  at  the  time  of 
Pearl  Harbor  had  swollen  to  46  full-time  radioteletypewriter  channels. 

The  Army,  like  the  Navy,  established  cryptanalytic  units  in  the  several 
theaters  of  war.  Their  organization  varied  from  one  theater  to  another. 
The  South  West  Pacific  Area,  under  MacArthur,  had  at  its  headquarters  a 
communications-intelligence  unit  called  the  Central  Bureau  and  in  the  field 
a number  of  subordinate  units.  Central  Bureau,  or  simply  C.B.,  had  been 
founded  in  August  of  1942  by  Lieutenant  Colonel  Joe  R.  Sherr,  who  had 
been  head  of  the  18-man  2nd  Signal  Service  Company  detachment  in  the 
Philippines  and  who  had  accompanied  MacArthur  to  Australia.  Later, 
Abraham  Sinkov,  who  had  been  another  of  Friedman's  original  crypt- 
analysts, went  out  to  take  charge.  C.B.  was  quartered  in  a rambling 
wooden  house — which  local  legend  said  was  a former  whorehouse — close  to 
the  Ascot  racetrack  in  Brisbane.  A guard  stood  in  front.  A small  air-condi- 
tioned brick  building  at  the  track  itself  housed  the  I.B.M.  machinery.  Sinkov 
worked  wonders:  when  a downed  Japanese  bomber  yielded  an  air-to-ground 
codebook,  it  was  discovered  that  Sinkov  had  already  recovered  nearly  all  of 
it.  His  title  at  the  end  of  the  war  was  Cryptanalytic  Officer,  Signal  Intelligence 
Service,  U.S.  Army  Forces,  Far  East;  his  rank  by  then  was  colonel.  A sweet 
and  unmilitary  man  who  seemed  slightly  embarrassed  by  the  eagles  on  his 
shoulders,  he  was  unable  to  return  a salute  without  blurting  out  a “Good 
morning.”  He  was  awarded  a Legion  of  Merit  and  an  Oak  Leaf  Cluster  to  it 
for  his  work. 

Some  elements  of  the  Central  Bureau  were — despite  the  name — attached 
to  widely  scattered  units.  MacArthur's  chief  signal  officer,  Brigadier  General 
Spencer  B.  Akin,  who  enjoyed  more  authority  than  any  other  theater  signal 
officer,  attached  communications-intelligence  units  to  major  headquarters 
so  that  the  intelligence  would  be  promptly  available  to  officers  who  could  act 
upon  it.  He  even  assigned  one  such  detachment  to  Admiral  William  F. 
Halsey,  Jr.’s  flagship,  while  Admiral  Spruance  found  the  Army  service  so 
valuable,  when  he  took  command  of  the  5th  Fleet,  that  he  kept  the  com- 
munications-intelligence specialists  with  him. 

In  addition.  Signal  Corps  radio  intelligence  companies  provided  tactical, 
combat-level  communications  intelligence.  One  of  the  first,  the  101st  Signal 
Company  (Radio  Intelligence),  replaced  Hawaii’s  old  Monitor  Post  5 in  July 
of  1942,  vastly  improving  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  work.  Typical,

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


perhaps,  of  these  companies  was  the  138th.  Trained  in  Spokane  for  Europe 
and  then  transported  to  the  East  Coast,  it  was  loaded  aboard  a transport 
and  promptly  shipped  through  the  Panama  Canal  to  Australia,  landing  there 
in  June  of  1943.  The  299-man  company  was  mobile  and  self-contained  so  that 
it  could  operate  in  isolation : it  was  mountable  within  two  hours  and  had  its 
own  truckdrivers,  cooks,  repairmen,  and  so  forth.  The  men  lived  in  tents. 

The  company’s  mission  was  to  determine  the  Japanese  order  of  battle  and 
ascertain  military  concentrations  and  movements.  Most  of  its  work  involved 
air-to-ground  messages.  To  pick  up  these  low-power  transmissions,  it  had  to 
move  forward  from  island  to  island  as  the  Allies  advanced.  Its  first  position, 
early  in  1944,  was  at  Nadzab,  an  airstrip  in  the  Markham  Valley  of  New 
Guinea.  One  subordinate  direction-finding  group  was  over  a hump  at  Gusap; 
another  was  on  an  abandoned  ranch  near  Darwin,  Australia,  where  it  enjoyed 
fresh  meat  daily.  In  the  middle  of  the  year  it  advanced  to  Biak,  a small  island 
north  of  New  Guinea,  where  it  was  nearly  strangled  by  the  thick  jungle,  and 
it  went  ashore  on  Leyte  about  five  days  after  the  first  wave  of  invasion  troops. 
By  then  its  direction-finding  groups  were  scattered  all  over  the  South  Pacific. 

The  unit  worked  near  the  front  lines  so  as  to  get  as  many  intercepts  as 
possible.  So  close  were  they  that  on  Leyte  late  in  1944  Japanese  paratroops 
dropped  on  the  unit,  apparently  having  mistaken  it  for  a command  post  be- 
cause of  its  numerous  antennae.  One  startled  radioman,  isolated  in  a direction- 
finding booth  in  the  middle  of  a clearing,  suddenly  heard  bullets  whizzing  all 
around  him.  The  codebreakers  dropped  their  pencils,  grabbed  their  rifles,  and 
engaged  in  rather  more  direct  action  against  the  enemy  than  that  to  which 
they  were  accustomed.  The  paratroopers  were  driven  off,  but  not  quickly 
enough  to  save  the  unit’s  documents  from  the  flames. 

Its  radio  operators,  specially  trained  in  Japanese  Morse,  listened  in  24 
hours  a day  on  at  least  some  of  its  two  dozen  receivers.  Sometimes  just  the 
circuits  being  used  would  give  Japanese  intentions  away.  On  Biak  in  1944,  the 
unit  quickly  learned  that  messages  on  a certain  frequency  invariably  preceded 
an  evening  air  raid — a bit  of  foreknowledge  that  enabled  one  member  to 
collect  regularly  on  sure-fire  bets  with  a sergeant  from  a nearby  outfit.  Other 
times  the  20-odd  nisei  in  the  unit  intercepted  Japanese  cleartext.  Usually, 
however,  the  radiomen  typed  out  the  coded  intercepts  and  handed  them  to  a 
traffic  analyst.  Most  of  the  messages  reported  planes  flying  from  one  point  to 
another,  and  the  analyst,  by  a study  of  call-signs,  could  tell  which  unit  and 
which  points  were  meant.  The  15  cryptanalysts  had  the  mechanical  task  of 
stripping  the  additive  from  codes  that  had  been  solved  at  C.B.  Each  day  a 
report  summing  up  the  unit’s  conclusions  went  rearward  to  5th  Air  Force 
headquarters,  to  which  the  unit  had  been  attached,  switching  from  the  Signal 
Corps  under  C.B.  to  the  Army  Air  Corps  and  receiving  the  new  name  of  1st 
Radio  Squadron,  Mobile. 

Success  usually  came  in  the  humble  form  of  an  early  warning  of  an  air  raid 
that  probably  saved  American  lives,  or  as  some  insight  into  a Japanese  move 


The  Scrutable  Orientals

that  enabled  an  American  commander  to  neutralize  it.  Late  in  the  war,  the 
unit’s  solution  of  Japanese  meteorological  codes  told  American  bombing 
commands  what  they  wanted  to  know  most — weather  conditions  over  target. 
The  outfit  alerted  the  Allies  to  a major  Japanese  build-up  when  it  solved  a 
message  reporting  the  presence  in  an  airplane  of  two  high-ranking  officers  of 
Japan’s  4th  Air  Army,  which  up  to  that  time  had  been  thought  to  be  in  north- 
ern China.  But  its  greatest  feat  was  the  discovery  of  a huge  concentration  of 
Japanese  air  strength  at  Hollandia.  The  5th  Air  Force  launched  massive  raids 
and  destroyed  more  than  100  enemy  planes.  Consequently  they  were  not 
present  to  attack  the  American  invaders,  who  splashed  ashore  with  virtually  no 
opposition. 

The  Imperial  Japanese  Navy  had  commenced  its  cryptanalytic  efforts  in 
1925  with  the  creation  of  an  ultra-secret  Tokumu  Han  (“Special  Section”)  in 
the  4th,  or  communications,  Department  of  the  Naval  General  Staff.  It  then 
numbered  six  persons,  including  clerks,  and  was  located  in  the  red  brick  Navy 
Ministry  building  in  Tokyo.  Among  its  early  members  were  the  young  naval 
officer  Hideya  Morikawa,  nephew  of  Chief  of  Staff  Admiral  Kanji  Kato,  and 
Morikawa’s  former  superior.  First  Lieutenant  Kamisugi,  who  had  handled 
cryptography  aboard  the  flagship  Nagato.  Captain  Kowalefsky,  the  Polish 
cryptologist  who  had  improved  the  codes  that  Yardley  had  solved,  lectured 
on  cryptanalysis,  and  the  neophyte  codebreakers  cut  their  eyeteeth  on  the 
gray  code  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  State,  making  their  entry  through  the 
classic  technique  of  identifying  naded  as  period* 

They  also  solved  Chinese  cryptograms  during  the  Manchuria  incident, 
primarily  because  these  were  based  on  a commercial  codebook  that  trans- 
formed the  Chinese  ideographs  to  four-digit  numbers  for  telegraphic  com- 
munication. After  the  Japanese  seizure  of  Shanghai  early  in  1932,  Morikawa 
was  sent  there  as  chief  of  a cryptanalytic  unit  attached  to  the  3rd  Fleet.  He 
solved  a Chinese  message  that  corroborated  a slightly  doubtful  Tokumu  Han 
solution  of  an  American  gray  message  reporting  Chinese  plans  to  use  its  Air 
Force  to  attack  Japanese  troops.  Instead  the  Japanese  struck  first,  catching 
most  of  Chiang  Kai-shek’s  Air  Force  at  Hangchow. 

The  Tokumu  Han  failed,  however,  to  break  two-part  codes,  such  as  the 
State  Department’s  brown  code,  those  used  by  the  American  Navy,  and  those 
introduced  by  Yardley  into  Chinese  communications  when  he  was  Chiang’s 
cryptologist — except  in  extraordinarily  favorable  circumstances.  One  such 
occurred  on  February  26,  1936,  when  two  regiments  mutinied  in  Tokyo  and 
several  statesmen  were  assassinated  in  an  attempted  coup  d’etat.  This  fur- 
nished the  cryptanalysts  with  an  ocean  of  text  and  plenty  of  probable  words 
to  go  fishing  with.  For  a short  time  they  read  most  American  communications, 
including  those  of  the  naval  attache.  Then  the  United  States  changed  systems,

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


and  the  skill  of  the  Tokumu  Han  again  proved  unequal  to  its  task.  Its  resource- 
fulness made  up  for  this:  near  the  end  of  1937,  Morikawa,  accompanied  by 
a locksmith,  a photographer,  and  some  lookouts,  broke  into  the  American 
consulate  at  Kobe  and  photographed  the  brown  code  and  the  m-138  cipher 
device,  which  the  Japanese  had  never  seen  before. 

Soon  thereafter,  as  part  of  Japan’s  preparation  for  war,  the  naval  shoguns 
built  their  first  big  intercepting  post  at  Owada,  a village  about  fifty  minutes 
by  car  from  Tokyo.  During  American  naval  maneuvers,  its  direction-finding 
and  traffic  analysis  helped  the  general  staff  analyze  American  forces  and 
tactics.  The  Tokumu  Han  also  added  cryptanalysts,  all  of  whom  were  officers. 
By  Pearl  Harbor  there  were  ten  working  full  time  and  ten  part  time.  They  had 
still  not  succeeded,  however,  in  reading  American  cryptograms. 

After  Pearl  Harbor,  the  rampant  growth  of  Allied  communications  com- 
pelled the  Tokumu  Han  to  expand  still  further.  The  first  batch  of  recruits — 60 
of  them — were  drawn  from  foreign-language  schools  and  commercial  colleges 
to  become  the  first  civilians  in  the  Tokumu  Han.  The  second  batch  consisted 
of  about  70  reserve  officer  candidates  selected  from  about  500  in  basic 
training  on  the  basis  of  their  competence  in  foreign  languages.  (These  signal 
intelligence  groups  differed  from  classes  learning  cryptography.)  During  a 
five-month  course  at  the  Naval  Communication  School  at  Kurihama  near 
Yokosuka — hard  by  the  Commodore  Matthew  Perry  monument — they 
practiced  International  Morse,  studied  the  elementary  Oriental  Tenji  and 
Tenchi  ciphers  as  well  as  the  Occident’s  more  advanced  Porta  and  Vigenere, 
and  learned  how  to  break  codes  and  ciphers.  Six  classes,  each  larger  than  its 
predecessor,  were  trained  during  the  war.  Some  graduates  were  assigned  to 
communications  intelligence  in  the  intelligence  units  of  fleet  and  force  head- 
quarters. In  November  of  1943,  for  example,  the  3rd  Fleet  employed  three 
officers  and  six  enlisted  men  to  monitor  enemy  messages.  But  most  went 
straight  into  the  Tokumu  Han  proper. 

A torrent  of  intercepts  was  pouring  into  it.  Most  came  from  the  hundreds 
of  radio  receivers  and  direction-finders  of  the  Owada  Communications  Unit. 
Some  were  picked  up  by  the  20  Americans  and  Australians  pressed  into  service 
with  the  Kanagawa  Communication  Force  near  Hiyoshi,  and  a few  messages 
trickled  in  from  fleet  radio  units.  Near  the  end  of  the  war  a unit  was  set  up  in 
a radish  field  at  Yokosuka.  The  entire  Tokumu  Han  had  swollen  to  several 
thousand  men  by  the  end  of  the  war,  most  engaged  in  intercepting.  So  hungry 
was  it  for  competent  personnel  that  it  did  something  almost  unheard-of  in 
misogynistic  Japan : it  employed  women — putting  about  30  nisei  girls  to  work 
eavesdropping  on  American  radiotelephone  conversations.  By  the  middle  of 
1 943  it  had  outgrown  its  quarters,  and  the  traffic  analysis  section  moved  to  the 
third  floor  of  the  Naval  War  College  in  Tokyo,  leaving  only  the  cryptanalysts 
at  the  Navy  Ministry 

They  comprised  the  2nd  Branch  of  the  Tokumu  Han’s  three.  In  charge  was 
Captain  Endo.  Under  him  were  several  national  sections:  United  States  and

Britain,  with  about  50  officers  under  Lieutenant  Commander  T.  Satake; 
China,  with  about  20  officers  under  Lieutenant  Commander  Nakatani; 
Russia  under  Lieutenant  Commander  Masayoshi  Funoto;  and  Italian,  Ger- 
man, French,  and  others,  about  10  officers.  The  3rd  Branch  handled  traffic 
analysis.  It  was  likewise  organized  on  a national  basis,  subdivided  into  areas,

be  working  on  a single  area.  The  branch  was  commanded  by  Morikawa,  now 
a captain,  who,  in  a separate  capacity,  also  headed  the  Owada  Communica- 
tions Unit.  The  1st  Branch  planned,  made  policy,  and  distributed  the  results 
of  the  two  operating  branches.  In  charge  was  Captain  Amano,  with

Commander  Hideo  Ozawa  his  executive  officer.  Command  of  the  entire 
Tokumu  Han  was  vested  in  the  chief  of  its  parent  body,  the  4th  Department; 
in  effect,  this  gave  the  Tokumu  Han  a seat  on  the  Naval  General  Staff.  In  1943 
the  head  of  the  4th  Department  was  Rear  Admiral  Gonichiro  Kakimoto,  and 
at  the  end  of  the  war,  Rear  Admiral  Tomekichi  Nomura. 

In  sharp  distinction  to  American  cryptanalysts,  who  were  reading  the  vast 
majority  of  Japanese  messages,  including  those  in  the  cryptosystems  of  top- 
most security,  the  codebreakers  of  the  Tokumu  Han  failed  almost  completely 
in  extracting  usable  information  from  American  messages.  They  did  not  even 
attempt  to  solve  medium-  and  high-echelon  messages,  couched  in  crypto- 
systems far  beyond  their  ability.  They  concentrated  instead  on  three  simpler 
cryptosystems  of  the  lowest  levels  of  command.  Even  with  these,  they 
achieved  only  limited  success. 

Typical  was  their  experience  with  a small  code  that  they  called  an  103. 
Carried  by  U.S.  Navy  patrol  planes,  it  consisted  of  a few  dozen  expressions, 
such  as  enemy  sighted.  The  code  was  changed  every  seven  to  ten  days,  but  the 
same  plaintext  expressions  appeared  in  successive  editions,  facilitating  solu- 
tion. Fortunately,  such  solutions  were  usually  obtained  too  late  to  take  any 
action  based  on  them. 

The  Tokumu  Han  cryptanalysts  succeeded  best  with  BAMS,  the  two-part 
superenciphered  Allied  merchant  ship  code.  They  solved  about  half  of  the 
BAMS  intercepts.  How  were  they  suddenly  able  to  do  so  well  with  so  relatively 
difficult  a system?  Germany  had  given  them  the  basic  BAMS  codebook,  which 
had  been  captured  by  her  raider  Atlantis.  Consequently,  the  Japanese  had 
only  to  remove  the  superencipherment.  BAMS  provided  occasional  tidbits  of 
information — three  transports  had  departed  from  California,  for  example,  or 
a vessel’s  course  and  speed  data — but  even  here,  Ozawa  complained,  “By  the 
time  the  code  [message]  was  broken,  the  ship  was  no  longer  in  the  original 
area.” 

The  Tokumu  Han  expended  most  of  its  cryptanalytical  energies  on  the 
csp  642,  the  strip  cipher,  which  the  U.S.  Navy  regarded  as  its  lowest-echelon 
system.  The  Navy  complicated  it  by  not  using  the  full  complement  of  30 
strips  every  time.  Instead  it  eliminated  from  zero  to  five  strips  from  one 
day  to  another.  Thus  one  day’s  messages  might  use  only  25  strips,  the  next 
day’s,  27,  the  next,  30. 

Japan  had  captured  strip  ciphers  on  Wake  and  Kiska,  and  with  these  she 
attacked  the  intercepts.  Her  methods  mixed  sophistication  and  naivete.  To 
determine  how  many  strips  had  been  eliminated,  the  Tokumu  Han  used 
I.B.M.  tabulators  of  the  First  Life  and  the  Meiji  Life  Insurance  companies  of 
Tokyo.  These  took  frequency  counts  at  intervals  of  30,  29,  28,  . . .,  25  and 
compared  them;  the  interval  that  showed  the  most  repetitions  indicated  the 
correct  encipherment  length.  Many  of  the  strip  messages  were  sent  by 
American  submarines;  these  were  identifiable  by  their  indicators — bimec  or 
femyh — and  by  their  transmission  from  close  to  the  Japanese  coast.  The 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


583 


Tokumu  Han  could  know  that  at  that  position  a merchant  ship  had  been 
sunk,  or  that  certain  units  of  the  Japanese  fleet  near  there  were  steaming  at 
such-and-such  a course  and  speed,  and  that  the  submarine  was  reporting  this. 
With  this  as  a lead,  two  first  lieutenants  who  had  majored  in  English  in  college, 
Shimizu  and  Oda,  composed  what  they  thought  the  plaintext  intercept  was. 
They  varied  expressions,  word  positions,  guesses  of  latitude  and  longitude 
until  they  had  a supposed  plaintext  that  matched  the  cryptogram  in  length 
and  whose  letters  all  differed  from  their  ciphertexts — since  in  the  strip  system 
no  letter  can  represent  itself.  Then  they  arranged  and  rearranged  the  strips 
until  they  had  reproduced  the  ciphertext  on  one  line  and  the  presumed  plain- 
text on  another ; the  sequence  of  strips  almost  certainly  represented  that  day’s 
key.  With  it  they  decrypted  other  intercepts. 

This  tortuous  method — for  some  reason  they  did  not  heed  the  lessons  of  de 
Viaris  and  Friedman  on  solving  this  system — suggests  why  so  little  information 
was  extracted  from  the  strip  cipher.  The  Tokumu  Han  kept  increasing  the 
size  of  the  section  in  its  American  branch  that  handled  strip  messages  until 
there  were  about  40  officers,  10  enlisted  men,  a dozen  typists,  two  dozen 
women  clerks,  Professor  Yamanashi  of  the  Navy  War  College,  and  a mathe- 
matician, Ozaki.  Though  efforts  were  continued  up  to  the  end  of  the  war, 
the  life  had  long  since  gone  out  of  them;  the  Tokumu  Han,  considering  the 
strip  cipher  unbreakable  for  all  intents  and  purposes,  vacated  its  hopes  for 
cryptanalysis  and  looked  instead  to  traffic  analysis  as  its  chief  source  of 
information. 

The  difficulty  with  this,  as  Lieutenant  Commander  Satake  put  it,  was  that 
“Our  whole  analysis  was  based  on  probabilities;  there  was  nothing  of  a 
definite  nature.”  The  3rd  Branch  graphed  the  volumes  of  urgent,  priority, 
routine,  and  deferred  messages  transmitted  from  each  major  American 
station.  It  charted  the  traffic  flow  among  the  various  call-signs.  It  located  the 
transmitters  by  a widespread  direction-finder  net  of  a dozen  linked  stations 
situated  from  Kiska  to  Rabaul,  from  Wake  to  Manila.  By  following  the  bulge 
in  BAMS  transmissions  from  California  to  Hawaii  to,  say,  Guam,  the  traffic 
analysts  could  predict  the  general  area  in  which  the  next  American  assault 
would  come.  Messages  from  reconnoitering  submarines  or  airplanes  rein- 
forced the  estimate.  The  time  of  the  attack  was  often  gauged  by  noncom- 
munications means — such  as  guesses  based  on  previous  movements — but 
sometimes  by  such  communications  intelligence  as  the  imposition  of  radio 
silence  or  an  increase  in  the  urgency  of  reconnaissance  messages.  None  of  these 
methods,  however,  enabled  the  3rd  Branch  to  pinpoint  time  or  place.  The 
Japanese  knew  in  advance,  for  example,  that  the  United  States  was  mounting 
an  invasion  of  the  Philippines,  but  when  it  would  come  they  could  tell  no 
more  closely  than  within  a month,  and  upon  which  island  the  assault  would 
fall,  they  never  knew  until  it  happened.  Compared  to  the  crystalline  precision 
of  America’s  Midway  intelligence,  Japanese  intelligence  floundered  in  a 
miasma  of  vaporous  generalities.  Only  once  in  four  years  of  war — at  the 


584  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Marshalls — did  it  get  word  to  a garrison  early  enough  to  help  it  prepare  for 
an  impending  attack. 

The  Japanese  Army,  personified  by  the  combined  War  and  Prime  Minister 
General  Hideki  Tojo,  had  panted  for  this  war  much  more  than  the  Navy,  and 
so  might  have  been  expected  to  produce  striking  communications-intelligence 
results  when  the  desired  hostilities  broke  out.  The  woeful  actuality  was 
summed  up  in  one  sentence  after  the  defeat  of  Nippon  by  Lieutenant  General 
Seizo  Arisue,  chief  of  Army  intelligence:  “We  couldn’t  break  your  codes  at 
all.” 

It  was  not  for  lack  of  trying.  The  Army  centered  its  communications- 
intelligence  work  at  Tanashi  and  dispersed  seven  intercept  and  direction- 
finding units  through  the  home  islands  alone.  Runners,  telegraph,  and  radio 
brought  the  average  of  250  diplomatic  and  press  messages  and  800  military 
dispatches  intercepted  each  day  to  the  cryptanalysts.  Headed  by  Major 
Machida,  they  worked  in  an  old  folks  home  named  Yofuen  in  Tokyo,  with 
two  unimportant  subordinate  groups  in  the  villages  of  Ono  and  Itakura. 
They  failed  utterly  with  the  diplomatic  traffic.  Not  until  1944  did  they  begin 
work  on  the  military  strip  ciphers,  and  though  they  drafted  some  mathematics 
students,  brought  in  an  I.B.M.  tabulator,  and  consulted  with  the  Navy,  they 
had  no  more  luck  than  did  the  Tokumu  Han. 

Field  units  were  attached  to  Army  staffs.  They  listened  in  to  American 
radio  messages  and  even  sent  out  special  wiretapping  patrols.  Results  were 
disappointing,  mainly  because  few  men  at  the  front  could  understand  English. 
And  since  the  soldiers’  war  in  the  Pacific  comprised  a series  of  brief,  indi- 
vidual battles  for  small  islands,  the  Army  had  little  opportunity  to  build  up 
an  enemy  order  of  battle  or  to  predict  attacks  by  traffic  analysis.  As  for  field 
cryptanalysis  of  Allied  messages,  Arisue’s  mournful  plaint  was  echoed  by  a 
colonel  on  the  staff  of  the  25th  Army:  “We  did  not  break  your  codes.”  How 
debilitated  their  intelligence  must  have  been — for  the  Japanese  rated  com- 
munications intelligence  as  their  most  valuable  source  of  information  on  the 
enemy! 

The  Arisue  concession  must  be  qualified  somewhat.  In  occupied  Manila, 
cryptanalysts  in  a staff  section  monitoring  squad  of  the  14th  Army  frequently 
solved  the  messages  of  Filipino  and  American  guerrillas.  These  jungle  war- 
riors wirelessed  information  on  Japanese  activities  to  MacArthur’s  head- 
quarters in  Australia  and  direct  to  San  Leandro,  California.  At  first  they 
enciphered  with  whatever  was  at  hand.  One  of  the  first  guerrillas,  an  unsur- 
rendered American  soldier  on  Luzon,  employed  the  venerable  U.S.  Army 
Cipher  Disk.  Some  used  m-94s,  at  least  one  of  which  was  captured  by  the 
Japanese.  When  Colonel  Wendell  Fertig  on  Mindanao  finally  contacted 
Australia  early  in  1943,  he  was  instructed : “If  you  know  double  transposition 
use  as  key  first  name  of  second  next  of  kin  [which  would  be  his  first-born 
child,  Patricia]  and  city  of  residence  second  next  of  kin  [she  was  then  living  in 
Golden,  Colorado]  and  encode  the  following  information  . . .”  as  an  authenti-

cation.  Later  in  the  war,  the  guerrillas  employed  new  ciphers  smuggled  in  on 
the  supply  submarines.  One  such  system,  comprising  seven  closely  typed  pages 
and  intended  for  a special  operation,  was  microfilmed  and  concealed  in  the 
ankle  patch  of  a pair  of  sneakers  for  transportation  to  another  leader, 
Macario  Peralta,  Jr.,  on  Panay. 

The  cryptanalysts  in  Manila  seemed  to  do  best  in  the  first  half  of  1943 — 
after  volume  from  the  guerrilla  stations  had  built  up  but  before  the  improved 
systems  appeared.  From  February  through  April  they  read  messages  in  a 
number  cipher  emanating  from  Cebu  and  used  to  report  shipping  movements, 
though  they  failed  to  solve  “a  special  code  . . . used  by  one  part  of  the  Cebu 
system” — probably  the  guerrilla  units  under  Colonel  Harry  Fenton.  In 
March  and  April  they  broke  the  system  used  by  Peralta’s  units  on  Negros,  as 
well  as  various  double  transpositions,  until  their  keywords  were  changed  in 
April.  Solution  of  the  system  used  by  the  headquarters  station  dkz  provided 
information  “on  the  general  organization  of  the  enemy  guerrillas  over  all  of 
Negros,  Siquijor,  and  Mindanao,”  boasted  the  cryptanalysts  in  their  report 
for  the  last  ten  days  of  April.  Next  month  they  had  to  confess  that  “decipher- 
ing is  at  a standstill,”  but  in  July — perhaps  as  a result  of  an  increase  of  traffic, 
since  214  messages  were  sent  in  just  ten  days  by  only  two  stations,  kml  and 
wze — they  broke  through  to  their  last  big  success.  They  cracked  the  Fenton 
system  that  had  rebuffed  them  before,  as  well  as  Fertig’s  messages,  enabling 
them  to  read  both  leaders’  back  files  since  March.  A few  days  later,  interroga- 
tion of  a captured  American  yielded  keywords  used  for  communication  with 
Australia  and  America. 

The  information  produced  by  the  cryptanalysts  and  the  direction-finding 
units  with  which  they  were  affiliated  enabled  Japanese  Army  units  to  raid 
guerrilla  posts,  often  with  success.  But  this  was  defensive;  it  removed  a thorn 
in  the  Japanese  side,  but  it  did  nothing  positive  for  their  war  effort.  And  even 
this  declined  steeply  in  the  fall  of  1943.  “Although  enemy  wireless  stations  in 
the  Philippines  were  disturbed  by  the  strength  of  our  punitive  activities,”  a 
September  report  said,  “they  avoided  punishment  by  skillful  concealment,  and 
they  are  maintaining  communication  between  themselves  as  well  as  with 
America  and  Australia.”  In  November,  after  some  empty  bragging  about  “a 
fatal  blow  to  the  guerrillas,”  the  Japanese  admitted  that  “As  always  all  the 
systems  were  very  active  and  communication  was  carried  on  extensively 
within  the  Philippines  and  with  outside  stations.”  And  at  these  stations, 
notably  Heindorf  House,  the  Brisbane  headquarters  of  MacArthur’s  Allied 
Intelligence  Bureau,  where  the  cryptographic  section,  under  Lieutenant  C.  B. 
Ferguson,  deciphered  the  incoming  traffic  with  quiet  efficiency,  the  producers 
of  intelligence  for  the  strategic  planners  noted  with  satisfaction  that  as  1944 
arrived  the  stream  of  information  from  the  Philippines  was  assuming  impres- 
sive proportions.  Thus  the  only  Japanese  cryptanalyses  that  might  be  con- 
sidered to  any  degree  successful  turned  out  in  the  end  to  be  short-lived, 
limited,  and  utterly  inconsequential  to  the  greater  course  of  the  war.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Japan’s  cryptography  was  as  poor  as  her  cryptanalysis,  though  it  looked 
good  on  paper.  Codes  were  numerous,  with  different  users  having  their  own ; 
they  were  also  changed  regularly  and  varied  from  one  geographical  area  to 
another.  But  the  system  did  not  work  out  well.  Poor  administration,  distribu- 
tion troubles,  and  lax  security  vitiated  the  theory. 

Admittedly,  the  Japanese  faced  a difficult  situation.  Just  getting  codebooks 
to  the  thousands  of  ships  and  island  garrisons  scattered  over  the  20,000,000 
square  miles  that  they  had  conquered  posed  a staggering  physical  problem. 
Indeed,  this  problem  had  defeated  them  twice  before  Midway.  Furthermore, 
the  problem  was  magnified  by  the  great  numbers  of  codebooks  that  had  to  be 
distributed.  Exactly  how  many  codes  Japan  employed  throughout  the  war 
may  never  be  known.  Probably  the  figure  would  reach  several  hundred,  if 
every  edition  of  the  small  codes  carried  by  airplanes  and  auxiliary  vessels 
were  counted.  An  outline  of  Japanese  naval  cryptosystems — all  of  which  were 
codes — will  give  an  impression  of  the  bristling  panoply  employed  by  a modern 
nation,  as  well  as  of  Japanese  distribution  difficulties.  Probably  not  all  were 
in  use  together.  In  each  case,  the  letter  or  the  kana  names  the  codebook.

Many  special  systems  also  served.  The  polyalphabetic  date-time  cipher  that 
Wright  solved  before  Midway  and  the  chi-he  map  grid  code  were  two 
examples.  There  were,  in  addition,  a primary  signal  book  for  visual  signals, 
lists  of  standard  and  special  abbreviations,  and  call-sign  tables  for  both 
strategic  and  tactical  communications. 

Once  the  Japanese  introduced  a special  code  for  extra  secrecy.  The  effects 
were  disastrous.  On  June  15,  1944,  when  they  set  in  motion  their  big  A-Go 
operation  to  ambush  the  Allied  fleet,  the  carrier  Taiho,  flagship  of  their  1st 
Mobile  Fleet,  carried  this  highly  secret  code  for  communications  with  Com- 
bined Fleet  headquarters.  Four  days  later,  an  American  submarine  torpedoed 
it,  and  a delayed  gasoline  explosion  destroyed  all  communications  facilities, 
including  the  special  code.  Urgent  messages  from  headquarters  piled  up  until 
other  ships  reported  the  loss.  Among  them  was  one  reporting  that  the  fleet 
was  being  trailed  by  an  enemy  task  force,  which  attacked  and  sank  another 
carrier.  The  A-Go  operation  ended  in  failure  and  the  Marianas  were  lost. 

The  Japanese  Army  encoded  its  messages  with  four-figure  codes  that  were 
superenciphered  with  the  usual  additives.  For  example,  in  the  code  used  by 
the  6th  Division  around  Bougainville  late  in  1943,  9019  stood  for  23rd Infantry, 
9015  for  division  headquarters,  9022  for  6th  Cavalry,  and  so  forth.  The  cipher 
section  of  the  Kwantung  Army  in  Manchuria  compiled  a 100-page  geograph- 
ical supplement  to  Army  Codebook  No.  3,  listing  codenumbers  for  places 
across  the  border  in  Siberia  as  preparation  for  a possible  attack.  The  Army 
convened  an  annual  conference  in  Tokyo  for  the  chiefs  of  cipher  sections  of  its 
various  Army  headquarters. 

The  wartime  increase  in  communications  naturally  accelerated  the  Japan- 
ese Navy’s  prewar  schedule  of  changing  a code  every  few  years.  The  new 
standard  called  for  changing  the  fleet  system  every  six  months  to  a year,  its 
additives  every  month  to  six  months,  and  the  tactical  code  every  month.  In 
general  this  was  met,  except  for  the  tactical  otsu,  which  was  revised  only  once 
or  twice  a year.  jn25,  for  example,  went  through  about  a dozen  editions  during 
the  war — JN25b,  c,  d,  and  so  on. 

The  numerous  codes,  and  the  frequent  revisions  of  the  most  important 
ones,  overburdened  the  Navy’s  distribution  system.  To  ease  the  strain,  the 
Navy  divided  its  whole  theater  of  operations  into  eleven  “code  areas." 
Distribution  to  one  area  would  not  depend  upon  distribution  to  another, 
and  failure  to  get  a code  to  an  outpost  would  not  compromise  the  entire 


588 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


system.  The  plan  was  for  each  area  to  have  its  own  code,  called  ha-1,  ha-2, 
and  so  on,  according  to  the  area.  But  the  ha  codes  were  not  compiled  in  time, 
code  ten  had  to  be  used  instead,  and,  as  it  worked  out,  all  areas  got  the  same 
code  anyway  with  only  the  additive  tables  differing  from  one  code  area  to 
another.  High  commands  additionally  held  the  ro  code  (jn25)  for  commu- 
nications with  other  code  areas. 

This  snafuing  seems  to  have  resulted  from  an  administrative  arrangement 
that  was  both  unnecessary  and  unintelligent.  Communications  security  in  the 
Imperial  Japanese  Navy  was  basically  the  job  of  the  10th  Section  of  its  4th 
Department  (communications,  whose  Special  Section  was  the  Tokumu  Han). 
The  10th  Section  planned  cryptographic  procedures,  outlined  the  training  of 
code  clerks,  compiled  codebooks  and  additive  tables,  and  supervised  produc- 
tion. At  first  the  printing  of  codebooks  was  done  by  the  Printing  Bureau  of  the 
Japanese  Cabinet,  later  by  the  Navy  Ministry’s  printing  office.  Volume  in- 
creases brought  the  presses  of  the  Naval  Torpedo  and  Communications 
Schools  into  service.  Still  later,  most  of  the  cryptographic  printing  was  trans- 
ferred to  the  Navy-controlled  Bunjudo  Printing  Office  in  Yokohama,  and  in 
1944  the  10th  Section  moved  onto  the  firm’s  premises.  (This  followed  the 
transferral  in  September,  1943,  of  routine  encoding  and  decoding  of  head- 
quarters messages  from  the  10th  Section  to  the  Tokyo  Communications 
Unit,  thereby  relieving  a staff  of  a line  function.  Headquarters  now  conformed 
to  the  Navy-wide  arrangement,  in  which  local  communications  units  encoded 
and  decoded  for  their  commands.) 

After  being  printed  under  the  control  of  the  10th  Section,  the  codebooks 
were  physically  taken  to,  and  passed  into  the  custody  of,  the  Navy  Library, 
which  distributed  all  naval  publications.  This  main  library  in  turn  sent  the 
codebooks  out  to  the  district  libraries,  under  the  escort  of  librarians.  District 
staff  officers  then  carried  the  codebooks  en  masse  to  their  area’s  commands, 
where  they  were  handed  out  to  individual  ships  and  units.  Minor  recipients 
picked  up  their  codebooks  themselves  at  the  district  library,  or  sometimes 
received  them  by  registered  mail.  The  Japanese  sought  to  disseminate  to  com- 
bat units  not  only  the  new  code,  but  a reserve  code  that  was  to  supplant  the 
new  one.  In  addition,  another  back-up  code  was  held  at  the  district  libraries. 
Canceled  codebooks  were  at  first  returned  to  Japan,  but  later  in  the  war  they 
were  simply  burned  and  notification  filed  in  writing. 

The  severance  of  the  distributive  function  from  the  productive,  and  its 
bestowal  on  personnel  less  alive  than  the  10th  Section  to  the  imperatives  of 
communications  security,  endangered  Japanese  cryptography.  The  librarians 
sometimes  lost  codebooks;  sometimes  they  simply  failed  to  observe  the  proper 
precautions.  In  1943,  a box  of  cryptographic  publications  en  route  from  Kure 
to  the  Tsingtao  Base  Force  in  China  was  inadvertently  opened.  This  was 
specifically  charged  to  failure  to  provide  a responsible  escort  aware  of  the 
publications’  importance.  When  a freight  car  carrying  codebooks  from  the 
Yokosuka  Naval  District  Library  arrived  at  the  Ominato  Ship  and  Ordnance

Department  in  1943,  its  door  lock  was  found  to  be  missing.  Investigators 
could  not  ascertain  whether  it  had  fallen  off  or  been  knocked  off,  but  since 
the  packing  appeared  undisturbed,  they  assumed  that  no  compromise  had 
occurred.  In  1944,  a whole  load  of  codebooks  disappeared  during  their  rail 
trip  from  the  Chinhae  Communications  Unit  to  one  of  its  detachments.  The 
unit  was  simply  issued  replacements.

Part  of  a page  of  the  encoding  section  of  a 1943  edition  of  the  main  Japanese 
Navy  code 

The  Japanese  stiffened  this  rather  lax  attitude  when  it  came  to  losses  in  the 
combat  zone.  A submarine  unloading  cargo  at  Salamaua,  New  Guinea,  crash- 
dived  to  avoid  air  attack  and  some  codebooks  were  washed  off  deck.  “Emer- 
gency measures” — whatever  they  were — were  taken.  They  were  also  taken  in 


590 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


1943,  when  a transport  plane  jettisoned  some  cargo  because  of  motor  trouble 
between  Truk  and  Rabaul.  Included  was  a tightly  packed  box  of  codebooks 
which  might  have  floated  to  nearby  land.  When  the  Allies  assaulted  Biak  in 
May,  1944,  a radio  crew  carrying  codebooks  to  a safer  location  encountered 
an  Allied  patrol,  and  during  the  skirmish  the  codebooks  were  lost.  The 
responsible  officer  did  not  report  it  for  three  weeks.  Prompt  investigation 
showed  that  only  one  or  two  lesser  codes  were  missing,  but  since  the  loss  took 
place  while  the  Japanese  were  planning  their  A-Go  operation,  they  changed 
codes  wholesale.  A new  edition  of  jn25  was  issued.  Ironically,  one  of  the 
main  effects  of  the  changes  was  to  hamper  Japanese  communications  on  the 
eve  of  the  operation. 

But  their  remedial  steps  could  not  always  prevent  serious  breaches  of 
their  communications  security.  One  unavoidable  case  was  that  of  the 
submarine  7-7. 

On  the  night  of  January  29,  1943,  the  cargo-  and  troop-carrying  7-7  had 
the  misfortune  to  surface  near  the  New  Zealand  corvette  Kiwi,  commanded 
by  Lieutenant  Commander  G.  Bridson.  He,  his  chief  engineer,  and  his  medical 
officer  were  famed  throughout  the  South  Seas  for  their  mastodonic  bulk  and 
their  practice  of  parading  through  Noumea  playing  on  a dented  trombone,  a 
jazz  whistle,  and  a concertina.  Upon  spotting  7-7,  Bridson  put  his  helm  over 
and  rang  up  full  speed  to  ram.  When  the  chief  questioned  this,  he  was  told : 
“Shut  up!  There’s  a weekend’s  leave  in  Auckland  dead  ahead  of  us.”  Ram 
they  did,  though  7-7  was  half  again  as  big  as  Kiwi  and  had  twice  the  firepower. 
With  all  guns  from  20-millimeter  to  4-inch  blasting  away  at  a range  never 
exceeding  150  yards,  Kiwi  backed  off  and  charged  again — this  time  for  “a 
week’s  leave.”  A third  time  she  rammed,  “for  a fortnight”;  this  time  she 
climbed  right  onto  7-7’s  deck.  At  11:20  p.m.  the  submarine  grounded  on  a 
reef  at  the  northwest  tip  of  Guadalcanal,  ending  the  battle. 

Among  other  things,  she  was  carrying  200,000  codebooks.  The  crew 
buried  some  of  these  on  the  enemy-held  shores,  and  when  word  of  the  action 
got  back  to  Japanese  headquarters,  aerial  bombardment  and  submarine 
torpedoing  was  ordered  in  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  destroy  the  documents 
still  aboard.  But  the  Allies  had  already  recovered  the  codebooks,  which  in- 
cluded both  current  and  reserve  codes.  The  Japanese  ordered  some  new 
codebooks  and  additive  tables  to  be  used,  but  jn25  remained  unchanged,  and 
the  documents  as  a whole  were  of  great  value.  Bridson  and  his  chief  were 
awarded  the  Navy  Cross. 

So  even  the  best  of  Japanese  intentions  proved  to  be  too  little  and  too  late. 
Their  communications  security  was  as  bad  as  their  communications  intelli- 
gence. Sometimes  it  seemed  as  if  they  didn’t  care.  The  Navy  attempted  to  find 
a water-soluble  ink  for  codebooks  to  dissolve  the  printing  when  the  books 
were  jettisoned  or  the  ship  sunk,  but  when  the  Technical  Research  Laboratory 
reported  that  it  could  not  find  one  that  would  fully  obliterate  the  writing 
when  immersed  and  yet  would  not  run  when  splashed  with  rain,  sea  spray,  or 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


591 


sweat,  this  worthy  effort  simply  petered  out.  Certainly  a lackadaisical  attitude 
blighted  their  communications  security.  Instructions  for  a new  Army  code 
complained  that  “in  certain  situations,  the  use  of  the  National  Army  Code 
was  terrifying.”  Though  these  instructions  pointed  out  that  sometimes  code 
messages  were  sent  to  units  which  do  not  have  the  codebook  for  them,  and 
urged  that  “The  nature  of  the  b Supplement  [of  Army  b Code,  No.  3]  will  be 
studied  carefully  and  precautions  taken  so  that  such  things  will  absolutely 
never  happen  in  the  future,”  they  also  admitted  with  refreshing  candor  that 
“the  time  for  the  compilation  being  short,  printing  presses  being  busy  and 
lacking  the  materials  for  one  edition  of  the  codebook,  it  may  not  be  possible 
to  fulfill  the  needs  of  each  unit.”  For  communications  security,  they  seemed  to 
depend,  not  on  training  or  on  adequate  cryptosystems,  but  on  patriotic 
exhortation : “Even  if  there  are  any  blunders,  it  is  necessary  that  an  endeavor 
be  made  to  decipher  the  [garbled]  message  . . . even  though  it  is  just  a trivial 
matter  in  the  use  of  the  general  code  of  the  National  Army  ...  so  that  flaws 
will  not  be  exposed  and  earnest  prayers  will  be  offered  for  the  glorious 
progress  of  one  phase  in  the  fulfillment  of  the  sacred  duties  in  the  Great  East 
Asia  conflict.” 

In  part,  the  Japanese  trusted  too  much  to  the  reconditeness  of  their  lan- 
guage for  communications  security,  clinging  to  the  myth  that  no  foreigner 
could  ever  learn  its  multiple  meanings  well  enough  to  understand  it  properly. 
In  part,  they  would  not  envision  the  possibility  that  their  codes  might  be 
read;  the  success  of  the  Kiska  withdrawal — in  which  they  sneaked  5,000 
troops  off  the  Aleutian  island  in  mid- 1943,  leaving  only  three  yellow  dogs  to 
defend  it  against  a powerful  American  force — “proved”  to  them  that  their 
secrets  were  still  intact.  Perhaps  the  cryptographers  simply  grew  tired  of 
printing  the  2,000,000  codebooks  needed  to  replace  those  jeopardized  in  the 
course  of  war.  Perhaps  their  own  failures  with  American  ciphers  convinced 
them  that  cryptanalysis  was  a practical  impossibility.  In  any  event,  they 
hypnotized  themselves  into  the  delusion  that  their  codes  were  never  seriously 
compromised. 

An  incident  of  1943  epitomizes  Japanese  incompetence  in  this  whole  field. 
It  involved  a future  President  of  the  United  States,  who,  with  his  crew,  formed 
the  subject  of  a series  of  dispatches  the  Japanese  apparently  never  solved. 

These  messages  were  transmitted  by  three  brave  Australian  coastwatchers, 
part  of  a widespread  network  whose  members  observed  enemy  activity  from 
the  peaks  and  cliffs  of  enemy-held  islands,  collected  tidbits  from  native  allies, 
and  radioed  their  information  to  Allied  military  commands.  They  frequently 
gave  valuable  early  warning  of  Japanese  bombing  raids  and  ship  movements, 
and  they  assisted  in  the  rescue  of  downed  Allied  airmen. 

In  the  early  morning  hours  of  August  2,  1943,  coastwatcher  Lieutenant 
Arthur  Reginald  Evans  of  the  Royal  Australian  Naval  Volunteer  Reserve  saw 
a pinpoint  of  flame  on  the  dark  waters  of  Blackett  Strait  from  his  jungle

ridge  on  Kolombangara  Island,  one  of  the  Solomons.  He  did  not  know  then 
that  the  Japanese  destroyer  Amagiri  had  rammed  and  sliced  in  half  an 
American  patrol  torpedo  boat,  PT 109,  Lieutenant  John  F.  Kennedy,  United 
States  Naval  Reserve,  commanding.  But  at  9:30  that  morning  he  received  a 
20-group  message  enciphered  in  Playfair,  the  coastwatchers’  cipher  system. 
He  deciphered  it  with  key  ROYAL  NEW  ZEALAND  NAVY  and  learned, 
PT  boat  one  owe  nine  lost  in  action  in  Blackett  Strait  two  miles  S W Meresu

coastv/atcher  near  Munda,  whose  call-sign  was  pwd,  that  Object  still  floating 
between  Meresu  and  Gizo,  and  at  1:12  p.m.  he  was  told  by  the  coastwatcher 
station  ken  on  Guadalcanal  that  there  was  a possibility  of  survivors  landing 
either  Vangavanga  or  islands.

Arthur  Evans'  decipherment  of  the  message  of  9:30  a.m.,  August  2,  1943,  that 
reported  the  sinking  of  John  F.  Kennedy's  PT  109 

This  was  just  what  Kennedy  and  his  crew  had  done.  They  had  swum  to 
Plum  Pudding  Island,  one  of  a group  that  hangs  from  the  southeastern  tip  of 
Gizo  Island.  This  group  was  behind  enemy  lines,  and  Gizo  itself,  only  three 
or  four  miles  away,  was  garrisoned  by  Japanese  troops.  Though  messages 
about  the  missing  crew  continued  to  stream  for  the  rest  of  the  week  between 
pwd,  ken,  and  gse,  as  Evans  called  his  station  (after  his  wife,  Gertrude  Slaney 
Evans),  the  Japanese  made  no  attempt  to  capture  them.  Yet  the  importance 
of  the  crew  should  have  been  obvious  to  the  Japanese  from  the  many  messages 
concerning  it  and  from  the  search  mission  flown  by  P-40s,  and  a capture 
could  not  have  caused  them  too  much  trouble,  since  on  one  occasion  a 
Japanese  barge  chugged  right  past  the  island  hideout  of  Kennedy  and  his 
crew.  Even  if  they  had  been  intercepting  and  reading  the  cryptograms,

however,  the  Japanese  may  not  have  wanted  to  waste  time  looking  for  the 
Americans,  since  none  of  the  messages  specified  their  location. 

This  excuse  vanished  at  9:20  a.m.  Saturday  morning,  August  7.  Two

These  five  messages  detailed  the  rescue  arrangements,  which  offered  the 
Japanese  a chance  to  get  not  only  the  shipwrecked  crew  but  the  force  coming 
out  to  save  it.  All  of  them  could  have  been  solved  within  an  hour  by  even  a 
moderately  experienced  cryptanalyst.  Yet  at  10  p.m.  the  operation  went  off 
without  the  least  hint  of  enemy  interference.  It  seems  likely  that  had  the 
Japanese  solved  these  elementary  enciphered  messages,  they  would  have 
taken  some  action  against  the  rescuers  or  the  rescued  or  both.  They  did 
nothing.  If  their  communications  intelligence  had  been  better,  how  might 
contemporary  history  have  been  changed ! 

Their  failure  sharpens  the  contrast  with  Allied  successes.  For  Allied 
cryptanalysts — which  in  the  Pacific  meant  mostly  Americans — galloped  like 
Tartars  through  the  phalanxed  ranks  of  a legion  of  Japanese  cryptosystems. 
They  ravaged  and  plundered  with  a prodigality  that  did  not  trifle  with  petty 
matters.  One  system,  when  solved,  proved  to  be  used  by  direction-finding 
teams;  though  this  might  have  afforded  some  indirect  clues  to  Japanese 
attacks,  it  was  cast  aside  for  richer  treasure.  Commander  Dyer  estimated  that 
American  cryptanalysts  demolished  75  Japanese  naval  codes  during  the  war. 

Among  them  was  the  four-digit  code  used  by  the  marus,  or  Japanese 
merchant  vessels — the  s code.  Presumably  this  was  attacked  after  the  more

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


important  combat  codes  had  been  resolved.  From  about  1943,  it  yielded 
information  of  the  greatest  value:  the  routes,  timetables,  and  destinations  of 
Japanese  convoys.  Japan’s  conquests  consisted  almost  entirely  of  islands 
which  could  be  supplied  and  reinforced  only  by  sea,  and  Nippon  itself  was 
an  island  empire.  American  submarines  therefore  undertook  in  the  Pacific 
what  U-boats  were  attempting  in  the  Atlantic,  and,  as  with  the  U-boats, 
cryptanalysis  helped  them  achieve  their  greatest  successes. 

A direct  line  led  from  frupac  to  the  office  of  Captain  R.  G.  Voge,  opera- 
tions officer  of  the  Commander,  Submarines  Pacific  Fleet.  The  Japanese  con- 
voys radioed  the  positions  where  they  estimated  they  would  be  as  of  noon  on 
the  next  few  days.  This  was  to  inform  their  own  forces  of  their  locations,  but 
frupac  solved  the  messages,  and  Jasper  Holmes,  an  ex-submariner  himself, 
relayed  them  to  Voge,  who  broadcast  them  to  the  American  submarines.  This 
fattened  their  kill.  Vice  Admiral  Charles  A.  Lockwood,  Jr.,  who  was  comsub- 
pac  during  most  of  the  war,  estimated  that  cryptanalytic  information  stepped 
up  American  sinkings  by  about  one  third  on  the  trade  routes  to  the  Philip- 
pines and  the  Marianas.  Eventually  the  submarine  commanders  received  it  so 
regularly  that  they  complained  if  a convoy  reached  its  noon  position  half  an 
hour  late! 

The  pigboats  accounted  for  nearly  two  thirds  of  Japanese  merchant  ton- 
nage sunk  during  the  war.  Their  torpedoing  of  110  tankers  from  the  East 
Indies  resulted  in  oil  shortages  in  the  homeland  that  prevented  the  training  of 
badly  needed  pilots  and  forced  a split-up  of  Japan’s  Navy,  with  serious  tactical 
results.  Starvation  at  home  caused  Japan  to  make  surrender  overtures  even 
before  the  islands  were  invaded,  before  the  atom  bombs  exploded.  After  the 
war,  Tojo  said  that  the  destruction  of  the  merchant  marine  was  one  of  the 
three  factors  that  defeated  Japan,  the  others  being  leapfrog  strategy  and  fast 
carrier  operations.  This  is  why  Dyer,  looking  back,  regarded  frupac’s  solu- 
tion of  the  maru  code  as  one  of  its  primary  contributions  to  victory. 

American  cryptanalysts  scored  some  long-range  combat  triumphs  as  well. 
Shortly  after  MacArthur  invaded  Leyte,  they  discovered  from  their  reading  of 
coded  enemy  messages  that  40,000  soldiers  were  on  their  way  to  reinforce 
Japanese  troops  in  the  Philippines.  American  air  and  sta  power  met  and 
destroyed  this  force,  and  not  a man  reached  Leyte.  During  the  Okinawa  cam- 
paign, the  sharp  ears  of  the  cryptanalysts  overheard  the  orders  that  directed 
the  superbattleship  Yamato,  a 72,000-ton  monster  with  18-inch  guns  that 
could  hurl  a projectile  22  miles,  to  sortie  in  a last-ditch  defense  effort.  They 
passed  this  news  to  the  American  commanders  on  the  spot.  Thus  alerted,  the 
commanders  prepared  to  attack  her,  and  after  a picket  submarine  reported 
her  position,  flung  wave  after  wave  of  carrier-based  planes  at  her.  They 
struck  her  at  12:32  p.m.  April  7,  1945,  and  after  less  than  two  hours  of 
repeated  bomb-hits  and  torpedoings,  the  world’s  largest  battleship  slid  to  the 
bottom,  rumbling  and  exploding,  and  taking  with  her  2,488  officers  and  men 
of  her  complement  of  2,767. 


The  Scrutable  Orientals  595 

frupac  also  engendered  what  is  probably  the  most  spectacular  single 
incident  ever  to  result  from  cryptanalysis. 

In  the  spring  of  1943,  Admiral  Isoroku  Yamamoto  came  down  to  Rabaul 
to  take  personal  charge  of  the  deteriorating  situation  in  the  Solomon  Islands. 
Japan  had  just  been  pushed  off  Guadalcanal  and  her  supply  lines  were  being 
snarled  by  Allied  air  attacks.  Yamamoto  welded  together  the  biggest  Japanese 
air  armada  of  the  war  and  sent  it  against  the  Allies,  achieving  some  tactical 
successes.  In  preparation  for  further  aerial  offensives,  the  stocky,  black- 
browed  seaman  decided  to  make  a one-day  morale  and  inspection  tour  of 
bases  in  the  upper  Solomons.  Those  bases  would  have  to  be  alerted,  together 
with  several  other  units,  so  that  they  could  make  the  many  preparations 
needed  for  an  inspection  by  the  Commander  in  Chief  Combined  Fleet.  At 
5:55  p.m.  on  April  13,  1943,  the  commander  of  the  8th  Fleet  broadcast 
Yamamoto’s  itinerary  of  five  days  hence  to  the  1st  Base  Force,  the  26th 
Air  Flotilla,  all  commanding  officers  of  the  1 1th  Air  Flotilla,  the  commander 
of  the  958th  Air  Unit,  and  the  chief  of  the  Ballale  Defense  Unit.  The  great 
variety  of  addressees,  plus  the  need  to  safeguard  the  person  of  the  head  of  the 
Navy,  makes  it  almost  certain  that  the  Japanese  communicator  selected  the 
current  edition  of  jn25 — the  most  widely  distributed  high-security  code — in 
which  to  armor  this  information. 

Unfortunately  for  the  Japanese,  this  armor  plating  had  been  dissolved 
in  the  acid  of  Allied  cryptanalysis.  As  with  the  pre-Midway  solution,  the 
scattered  codebreaking  units  had  exchanged  their  results — possibly  augment- 
ing them  this  time  with  documents  salvaged  a few  weeks  previously  from  the 
grounded  submarine  /-/.  Though  the  additive  had  been  changed  only  two 
weeks  before,  on  April  1,  large  portions  of  it  had  been  recovered.  At  frupac, 
these  results  had  been  punched  onto  cards  for  the  I.B.M.  machines,  frupac’s 
monitors  had  intercepted  the  message  that  the  8th  Fleet  commander  had 
spread  on  the  airwaves,  and  when  this  was  fed  to  the  robot  cryptanalyst  in  a 
form  palatable  to  it,  it  swallowed  it,  digested  it  to  the  accompaniment  of 
horrendous  clickings  and  rattlings,  and  disgorged  the  Japanese  plaintext. 

Because  of  the  many  addressees,  the  “scanners,”  or  traffic  analysts,  had 
probably  flagged  the  message  as  one  of  more  than  ordinary  importance. 
Hence  the  plaintext  went  to  a translator  of  more  than  ordinary  competence,  a 
38-year-old  Marine  Corps  lieutenant  colonel,  Alva  Bryan  Lasswell.  He  had 
studied  Japanese  as  a language  officer  in  Tokyo  from  1935  to  1938  and  had 
helped  with  communications-intelligence  activities  in  Hawaii  since  May,  1941. 
The  message  was  essentially  complete,  but  he  helped  fill  in  some  holes,  while 
Dyer  recovered  some  additives  and  Wright  determined  the  meaning  of  in- 
ternal geographical  codegroups:  rr  for  Rabaul ; rxz  for  Ballale , a small 
island  in  the  Solomons  group,  just  south  of  Bougainville;  rxe  for  Shortland, 
another  of  the  Solomons,  also  south  of  Bougainville  and  west  of  Ballale;  and 
rxp  for  Buin,  a base  on  the  southern  tip  of  Bougainville.  When  this  work  was 
completed,  Lasswell  translated  the  message.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

The  Commander  in  Chief  Combined  Fleet  will  inspect  Ballale,  Shortland, 
and  Buin  in  accordance  with  the  following: 

1 . 0600  depart  Rabaul  on  board  medium  attack  plane  (escorted  by  6 fighters) ; 
0800  arrive  Ballale.  Immediately  depart  for  Shortland  on  board  subchaser  (1st 
Base  Force  to  ready  one  boat),  arriving  at  0840.  Depart  Shortland  0945  aboard 
said  subchaser,  arriving  Ballale  at  1030.  (For  transportation  purposes,  have 
ready  an  assault  boat  at  Shortland  and  a motor  launch  at  Ballale.)  1 100  depart 
Ballale  on  board  medium  attack  plane,  arriving  Buin  at  1110.  Lunch  at  1st  Base 
Force  Headquarters  (Senior  Staff  Officer  of  Air  Flotilla  26  to  be  present).  1400 
depart  Buin  aboard  medium  attack  plane;  arrive  Rabaul  at  1540. 

2.  Inspection  Procedures:  After  being  briefed  on  present  status,  the  troops 
(patients  at  1st  Base  Force  Hospital)  will  be  visited.  However,  there  will  be  no 
interruptions  in  the  routine  duties  of  the  day. 

3.  Uniforms  will  be  the  uniform  for  the  day  except  that  the  commanding 
officers  of  the  various  units  will  be  in  combat  attire  with  decorations. 

4.  In  the  event  of  inclement  weather,  the  tour  will  be  postponed  one  day. 

Yamamoto  was  known  to  be  almost  compulsively  punctual.  He  adhered 
to  his  schedules  virtually  to  the  split  second.  And  Lasswell  was  now  reading 
almost  a minute-by-minute  listing  of  his  activities  on  a day  during  which  the 
admiral  would  come  closer  to  the  combat  zone  than  he  had  probably  ever 
done  before!  The  cryptanalyzed  intercept  amounted  to  a death  warrant  for 
the  highest  enemy  commander. 

The  question  was : Should  it  be  executed?  It  was  not  an  easy  one  to  answer. 
Nimitz  wrestled  with  the  pros  and  cons.  If  Yamamoto  were  shot  down, 
would  a better  man  be  appointed  to  succeed  him?  Commander  Layton,  the 
fleet  intelligence  officer,  set  out  the  arguments,  most  of  which  Nimitz  well  knew. 

Yamamoto,  59,  was  the  dominant  figure  of  the  Japanese  Navy.  A prophet 
of  air  power,  aggressive  and  determined,  he  devised  bold,  imaginative  plans 
and  executed  them  under  strong  leadership.  He  was  the  Shogi  (Japanese  chess) 
champion  of  his  navy,  and  in  the  1920s  had  enjoyed  matching  wits  with 
Americans  at  poker,  which  he  played  very  well  indeed.  He  had  lost  two  fingers 
of  his  right  hand  in  battle,  and  he  manipulated  the  cards  with  the  remaining 
three  in  so  wizardly  a manner  that  he  distracted  his  opponents.  American 
intelligence  rated  him  as  “Exceptionally  able,  forceful,  and  quick-thinking.” 
His  men  idolized  him.  “If,  at  the  start  of  the  Pacific  War,”  wrote  Commander 
Fuchida,  leader  of  the  Pearl  Harbor  attack,  “a  poll  had  been  taken  among 
Japanese  naval  officers  to  determine  their  choice  of  the  man  to  lead  them  as 
Commander  in  Chief  Combined  Fleet,  there  is  little  doubt  that  Admiral 
Yamamoto  would  have  been  selected  by  an  overwhelming  majority.” 

Layton  summed  up  with  the  observation  that  Yamamoto  was  preeminent 
in  all  categories,  that  any  successor  would  be  personally  and  professionally 
inferior,  and,  finally,  that  the  death  of  the  Commander  in  Chief  would 
demoralize  the  Japanese,  who  venerate  their  captains  much  more  than  Occi- 
dentals do.  Nimitz  concurred.  He  realized  that  the  shock  of  such  a leader’s 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


599 


death,  combined  with  the  elimination  of  the  finest  strategist  of  the  enemy  war 
machine,  would  equal  a major  American  battle  victory.  He  was  furthermore 
probably  influenced  by  the  general  American  hatred  of  Yamamoto.  Naval 
officers  knew  that  he  had  conceived  the  treacherous  strike  at  Pearl  Harbor  that 
had  slaughtered  their  shipmates  and  wrecked  their  ships.  He  had,  they  thought, 
arrogantly  boasted  that  he  would  dictate  peace  in  the  White  House.*  This 
was  why  Admiral  William  F.  (Bull)  Halsey  made  him  “No.  3 on  my  private 
list  of  public  enemies,  closely  trailing  Hirohito  and  Tojo.” 

By  chance,  the  Ballale-Shortland-Buin  area  was  in  Halsey’s  theater  of 
operations.  Consequently  Nimitz  sent  him  a top-secret  command-level  com- 
munication referring  to  the  Yamamoto  itinerary  and  authorizing  him  to  shoot 
down  the  Japanese  planes  if  his  forces  had  the  capability  of  doing  so.  Halsey 
was  in  Australia;  his  deputy,  Vice  Admiral  Theodore  S.  Wilkinson,  reported 
that  he  could  do  it,  but  invited  Nimitz’  attention  to  the  danger  of  making  the 
Japanese  suspicious  that  the  Allies  were  reading  their  codes.  If  they  changed 
them,  might  not  this  deprive  the  Allies  of  possibly  even  more  valuable  intelli- 
gence in  the  future  ? 

Nimitz  felt  that  this  bird  in  the  hand  was  well  worth  any  two  in  the  bush. 
Nevertheless,  he  sought  to  minimize  the  danger  by  following  Layton’s  sug- 
gestion of  a cover  story.  This  was  to  the  effect  that  Australian  coastwatchers 
had  radioed  in  the  Yamamoto  flight  information,  probably  getting  it  from 
friendly  natives  around  Rabaul.  The  coastwatchers  enjoyed  a superexcellent 
reputation  among  airmen  and  so  the  story  would  ring  true.  If  it  got  back  to 
the  Japanese,  they  might  never  even  think  about  codes.  Even  if  they  did 
realize  that  the  Allies  were  reading  their  codes,  either  by  capture  or  by  crypt- 
analysis, they  could  probably  do  no  more  than  issue  a new  edition  of  jn25  and 
perhaps  tighten  cryptographic  security.  But  this  had  happened  before,  and 
Allied  cryptanalysts  had  broken  the  new  codes.  The  most  realistic  assessment 
predicted  that  the  Yamamoto  mission  might  temporarily  dim  Allied  com- 
munications intelligence  while  cryptanalysts  sought  entry  into  the  new  code. 

Such  a loss  of  information  is  never  good,  but  it  would  be  less  unfortunate 
now,  when  the  Allies  were  resting  and  consolidating  their  positions,  than 
during  a major  operation.  No  such  advance  was  planned  for  two  and  a half 
months.  Hence  if  the  Japanese  changed  their  code  immediately  after  Yama- 
moto’s death,  the  cryptanalysts  would  have  ten  weeks  of  relative  quiet  to 
break  back  in.  In  his  reply  to  Wilkinson,  therefore,  Nimitz  ordered  him  to 
brief  all  personnel  on  the  cover  story,  iterated  his  authorization,  and  added 
a personal  “good  luck  and  good  hunting”  to  the  message. 

The  death  warrant  was  now  signed,  sealed,  and  delivered. 

On  the  afternoon  of  April  17,  Major  John  W.  Mitchell  and  Captain 
Thomas  G.  Lanphier,  Jr.,  both  of  the  Army  Air  Corps,  walked  into  a dank 
and  musty  Marine  dugout  on  Henderson  Field,  Guadalcanal.  An  operations

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


officer  handed  them  a cablegram  on  blue  tissue — the  kind  used  for  top-secret 
dispatches.  It  detailed  Yamamoto’s  itinerary,  including  times  of  arrival  and 
departure  from  each  place.  The  airmen  vetoed  a suggestion  to  strafe  him  while 
crossing  from  Ballale  to  Shortland  in  the  subchaser  because  of  the  difficulty 
of  identifying  the  right  craft.  Instead  they  decided  to  intercept  him  in  the 
air. 

Their  plan  depended  upon  Yamamoto’s  punctuality  and  required  careful 
timing  of  its  own : Ballale  was  near  the  limit  of  range  of  the  twin-engined  P-38 
Lightnings  that  the  pilots  flew,  so  there  would  be  little  fuel  for  waiting. 
Though  the  Japanese  message  specified  arrival  at  Ballale  at  8 a.m.  after  a 
two-hour  flight  from  Rabaul,  calculations  showed  that  the  two-motored 
Mitsubishi  (Betty)  attack  bombers  would  reach  Ballale  in  an  hour  and  45 
minutes;  this  was  partially  confirmed  by  the  estimated  hour-and-40-minute 
return  time  from  the  slightly  closer  Buin.  This  meant  that  Yamamoto  would 
arrive  at  Ballale  about  7:45  a.m.  Though  he  would  be  escorted  by  six  fighters, 
Mitchell  and  Lanphier  decided  to  attack  him  about  35  miles  up  the  Bougain- 
ville coast  to  avoid  the  planes  that  buzzed  around  Kahili  airstrip  not  far  from 
Buin.  This  pushed  the  time  of  interception  back  ten  minutes  to  7 : 35  a.m. — or 
9:35  a.m.  American  time. 

Next  morning,  18  P-38s  of  the  12th,  339th,  and  70th  Fighter  Squadrons 
lifted  off  the  Henderson  runway  at  7:25  (American  time).  Thirty-five  minutes 
later  and  700-odd  miles  away,  Yamamoto’s  flight  took  off  right  on  schedule. 
Radios  silent,  the  Americans  flew  a semicircle  of  435  miles  around  Munda, 
Rendova,  and  Shortland  at  wave-top  height  to  avoid  radar  detection. 
Mitchell  navigated  by  compass  and  airspeed  indicator,  and  two  hours  and 
nine  minutes  after  take-off  was  skimming  the  waves  toward  the  Bougainville 
coast.  He  had  timed  the  flight  to  the  split  second,  and  suddenly,  as  if  the  entire 
affair  had  been  rehearsed  to  perfection,  the  black  specks  of  Yamamoto’s 
squadron  appeared  five  miles  away. 

“Bogey.  Ten  o’clock  high,”  called  out  Lieutenant  Doug  Canning,  breaking 
radio  silence.  Mitchell  led  14  fighters  up  to  20,000  feet  as  cover  and  to  engage 
the  fighters.  Lanphier  dropped  his  belly  tanks,  and,  with  his  wing  man, 
Lieutenant  Rex  T.  Barber,  climbed  to  within  two  miles  of  Yamamoto’s  right 
and  a mile  in  front  of  him  before  his  escorting  Zeros  saw  them  and  turned  to 
attack.  Lanphier  disintegrated  one  of  them,  then  kicked  his  ship  on  its  back 
and  looked  down  for  the  lead  bomber.  He  spotted  it  dodging  away  at  tree-top 
level.  As  he  spun  toward  it,  two  Zeros  dived  at  him.  But,  he  said,  “I  remember 
suddenly  getting  very  stubborn  about  making  the  most  of  the  one  good  shot 
I had  coming  up.  I fired  a long  steady  burst  across  the  bomber’s  course  of 
flight,  from  approximately  right  angles.  The  bomber’s  right  engine,  then  its 
right  wing,  burst  into  flame.  . . . Just  as  I moved  into  range  of  Yamamoto’s 
bomber  and  its  [tail]  cannon,  the  bomber’s  wing  tore  off.  The  bomber  plunged 
into  the  jungle.”  The  Zeros  screamed  helplessly  overhead.  Barber,  meanwhile, 
exploded  the  other  Mitsubishi.  Lanphier  shook  his  pursuers  in  a speedy  climb 


601 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 

to  20,000  feet,  and  he  and  all  other  members  of  the  mission  except  one  returned 
safely  to  Henderson. 

Deep  in  the  Bougainville  jungle,  Yamamoto’s  devoted  aide  found  his 
admiral’s  charred  corpse  still  in  its  seat,  its  chin  on  a samurai  sword.  The 
body  was  extricated  with  care  and  solemnly  burned.  On  May  21a  Japanese 
newscaster  announced,  in  tones  heavy  with  sorrow,  that  Yamamoto,  while 
directing  general  strategy  on  the  front  line  in  April  of  this  year,  engaged  in 
combat  with  the  enemy  and  met  gallant  death  in  a war  plane.”  Toward  the 
end  of  the  communique  his  voice  became  choked,  as  if  through  tears.  As 
Layton  and  Nimitz  had  foreseen,  Yamamoto’s  death  stunned  the  entire 
nation.  On  June  5,  his  ashes  were  interred  with  great  pomp  in  Tokyo’s  Hibiya 
Park  in  the  presence  of  the  government  and  an  immense  and  silent  crowd.  The 
death  of  the  great  popular  hero  disheartened  Japanese  soldiers,  sailors,  and 
civilians.  “There  was  only  one  Yamamoto,  and  no  one  is  able  to  replace  him,” 
said  the  man  who  succeeded  him.  “His  loss  is  an  insupportable  blow  to  us.” 
Cryptanalysis  had  given  America  the  equivalent  of  a major  victory. 

In  forwarding  a report  of  the  Yamamoto  operation  to  Admiral  King, 
Nimitz  noted  that  it  took  place  “on  a particularly  high  plane  of  secrecy”  and 
recommended  that  “no  publicity  of  any  kind  should  be  given  this  action.” 
The  main  reason  was  to  keep  Japan’s  curiosity  from  being  drawn  to  how  the 
United  States  knew  that  Yamamoto  was  in  a certain  airplane.  A secondary 
reason  was  that  Lanphier’s  brother  was  a Japanese  prisoner  of  war  and 
reprisals  were  feared.  Thus  Americans  only  learned  of  the  admiral’s  death 
from  news  stories  based  on  the  Japanese  newscast. 

Many  wondered  how  it  had  happened.  No  major  combat  activity  exten- 
sive enough  to  cause  such  a death  had  occurred  in  April.  The  armed  forces, 
following  Nimitz’  advice,  blankly  disclaimed  any  knowledge  of  the  incident. 
One  rumor  speculated  that  Yamamoto  had  died  in  an  air  accident,  another 
that  he  had  committed  hara-kiri  because  of  increasing  Allied  successes.  But 
the  real  story  filtered  into  wider  and  wider  circles,  until  soon  much  of  official 
Washington  was  whispering  at  cocktail  parties  and  dinners— probably  right 
under  those  ubiquitous  “The  walls  have  ears”  posters — about  how  crypt- 
analysis killed  Yamamoto.  So  widespread  did  the  talk  become  that  one 
responsible  citizen  telephoned  General  Marshall  and  told  him  about  it. 

For  Marshall,  it  was  the  latest  headache  in  a long  series.  Security  was 
always  his  most  difficult  problem  in  dealing  with  intelligence  from  crypt- 
analysis— magic,  or  ultra,  as  it  was  sometimes  called.  Codebreaking  suc- 
cesses are  especially  vulnerable  to  betrayal  because  of  the  ease  with  which  a 
change  of  code  can  nullify  them.  The  problem  had  existed  since  well  before 
Pearl  Harbor,  when  in  his  concern  Marshall  had  ordered  special  zippered 
briefcases  with  padlocks,  restricted  the  number  of  recipients,  and  generally 
tightened  security  on  magic.  War  aggravated  the  problem.  The  cryptanalytic 
agencies  burgeoned,  their  output  increased,  the  number  of  distributees  rose.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Though  the  agencies  insisted  upon  discretion  as  one  of  their  prime  recruit- 
ing criteria,  the  demand  for  personnel  was  so  acute  that  some  bad  apples 
slipped  into  the  barrel.  Gossips,  would-be  big  shots,  and  just  plain  thoughtless 
individuals  bragged  about  how  their  work  was  winning  the  war.  This  reached 
a crescendo  in  the  Yamamoto  incident.  Marshall  had  repeatedly  sent  oral 
requests  through  g-2  to  F.B.I.  Director  J.  Edgar  Hoover  to  investigate  the 
leaks,  and  particularly  to  nab  some  flap-jawed  Army  officer  so  that  Marshall 
could  make  an  example  of  him  to  discourage  the  loose  talk.  Hoover  told 
Marshall  that  he  was  reluctant  to  probe  another  government  agency  for  fear 
of  being  regarded  as  heading  a Gestapo,  but  he  did  help.  Unfortunately,  the 
one  strong  case  that  they  found  was  snagged  by  a legal  technicality  that  would 
have  prevented  conviction. 

The  pre-Pearl  Harbor  policy  of  not  indicating  the  source  of  communica- 
tions intelligence  disseminated  to  field  commands  was  continued  during  the 
war.  This  extended  to  an  ally,  Russia.  Related  Marshall:  “We  have  told  them 
that  we  had  good  reason — not  good  reason — we  had  the  best  evidence  that 
certain  actions  were  going  to  be  taken  by  the  Germans  against  them,  but  we 
couldn’t  tell  them  why,  and  there  was  quite  a long  debate  as  to  whether  we 
should  not  go  into  the  whole  thing,  but  that  was  felt  most  dangerous  from 
two  points  of  view.  One  was,  we  were  spreading  the  thing  out,  and  we 
didn’t  know  who  all  would  become  involved  in  it;  and  more  particularly, 
they  would  probably  get  infuriated  because  they  hadn’t  had  it  from  the 
start.” 

This  extreme  caution  cloaked  magic  as  far  as  it  could  go — to  its  very 
effects  themselves.  The  third  of  four  alternating  red  and  black  paragraphs 
printed  on  the  cover  of  the  Top  Secret  magic  summaries  for  European,  Far 
Eastern,  and  diplomatic  traffic  stated : “No  action  is  to  be  taken  on  information 
herein  reported,  regardless  of  temporary  advantage,  if  such  action  might  have 
the  effect  of  revealing  the  existence  of  the  source  to  the  enemy.”  This,  of 
course,  was  a dilemma  of  the  Yamamoto  mission.  So  precious  was  magic 
that  the  Allied  command  on  occasion  let  convoys  sail  into  the  jaws  of  U-boat 
wolf  packs  rather  than  chance  the  Germans’  surmising  that  the  Allies  had  a 
way  of  avoiding  them.  In  the  Pacific,  American  submarines  were  allowed  to 
depredate  Japanese  merchant  vessels  on  an  ultra  basis  so  uninterruptedly 
only  because  other  intercepts  showed  that  the  Japanese  thought  that  the 
vessel  movements  were  reported  to  the  Allies  by  coastwatchers ; had  they  sus- 
pected cryptanalysis,  the  submarines  would  have  had  to  hold  off  somewhat, 
for  fear  of  losing  long-term  advantages. 

In  general,  American  security  problems  proceeded  from  magic’s  embar- 
rassment of  riches  and  its  existence  within  a democracy.  The  first  of  these 
produced  one  of  the  three  great  security  crises  that  plagued  magic  during  the 
war — the  buzzing  about  the  dramatically  successful  Yamamoto  shooting. 
Democracy  engendered  the  other  two  crises — one  at  the  time  of  Midway,  the 
other  during  a presidential  campaign. 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


603 


On  the  morning  of  Sunday,  June  7,  1942,  while  Yorktown  was  still  afloat 
and  the  Battle  of  Midway  still,  in  a sense,  in  progress,  the  Chicago  Tribune 
appeared  on  the  streets  with  a column-long  front-page  story,  headlined  “Navy 
Had  Word  of  Jap  Plan  to  Strike  At  Sea.”  Datelined  “Washington,  D.C.,  June 
7,”  it  began : 

The  strength  of  the  Japanese  forces  with  which  the  American  navy  is  battling 
somewhere  west  of  Midway  Island  in  what  is  believed  to  be  the  greatest  naval 
battle  of  the  war,  was  well  known  in  American  naval  circles  several  days  before 
the  battle  began,  reliable  sources  in  the  naval  intelligence  disclosed  here  tonight. 

The  navy  learned  of  the  gathering  of  the  powerful  Japanese  units  soon  after 
they  put  forth  from  their  bases,  it  was  said.  Altho  their  purpose  was  not  speci- 
fically known,  the  information  in  the  hands  of  the  navy  department  was  so 
definite  that  a feint  at  some  American  base,  to  be  accompanied  by  a serious  effort 
to  invade  and  occupy  another  base,  was  predicted.  Guesses  were  even  made  that 
Dutch  Harbor  and  Midway  Island  might  be  targets. 

The  story  went  on  to  describe  the  split-up  of  the  Japanese  armada  into  three 
forces  and  to  give,  in  the  greatest  detail,  the  composition  of  these  forces.  It 
named  the  four  carriers  of  the  striking  force  and  even  went  so  far  as  to  list — 
correctly— the  four  light  cruisers  that  supported  the  occupation  force.  Near 
the  bottom  of  the  page,  it  asserted:  “When  it  [the  Japanese  fleet]  moved  all 
American  outposts  were  warned.  American  naval  dispositions  were  made  in 
preparation  for  the  various  possible  attacks  the  Japs  were  believed  to  be  plan- 
ning.” The  dispatch,  which  carried  no  byline,  had  been  written  by  Stanley 
Johnston,  a Tribune  war  correspondent  who  later  authored  Queen  of  the 
Flattops.  Despite  its  dateline,  he  had  written  it  in  the  Pacific. 

At  no  point  did  the  story  refer  in  any  way,  even  obliquely,  to  Japanese 
codes  or  to  American  communications  intelligence.  But  the  Navy  feared  that 
the  Japanese  would  realize  that  its  details  could  have  come  only  from  a 
reading  of  their  coded  messages.  In  August,  the  Justice  Department  ap- 
pointed former  Attorney  General  William  L.  Mitchell  to  direct  a Chicago 
grand  jury  in  determining  whether  the  disclosure  of  confidential  information 
violated  the  Espionage  Act  of  1917.  The  Tribune  complained  that  it  was  being 
persecuted  because  the  Secretary  of  the  Navy,  Frank  Knox,  published  the 
rival  Chicago  Daily  News.  After  a five-day  closed  inquiry,  during  which 
Johnston  and  the  Tribune's  managing  editor  testified,  the  grand  jury  returned 
no  true  bill.  None  of  The  New  York  Times  accounts  of  the  investigation  men- 
tioned codes  or  suggested  any  reason  for  the  nonindictment  beyond  Mitchell  s 
statement  that  “no  violation  of  the  law  was  disclosed.”  However,  it  was  widely 
recognized  that  the  grand  jury  declined  to  indict  because  a trial  would  have 
called  attention  to  something  that,  the  authorities  hoped,  the  Japanese  might 
have  missed.  Their  hope  was  fulfilled.  The  Japanese  never  saw  it  and  never 
tumbled  to  the  solution.  Their  switch  to  JN25d  in  August  appears  to  have  been 
unrelated. 


604 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


After  everything  had  been  sewn  up,  a public  indiscretion  threatened  to  rip 
it  open  again.  Representative  Elmer  J.  Holland  of  Pennsylvania  made  a 
speech  about  the  episode  on  the  floor  of  Congress  on  August  31  which  was 
carried  far  and  wide  by  news  stories.  He  was  castigating  the  Tribune' s “un- 
thinking and  wicked  misuse  of  freedom  of  the  press.”  “American  boys  will 
die,  Mr.  Speaker,  because  of  the  help  furnished  our  enemies”  by  the  Tribune, 
he  declaimed.  But  in  stating  what  this  help  was,  he  disclosed  what  the  Tribune 
had  not  and  trumpeted  loud  and  clear  what  everyone  was  trying  to  hush  up: 

“that  somehow  our  Navy  had  secured  and  broken  the  secret  code  of  the 
Japanese  Navy.”  ^ 

Fortunately,  the  Japanese  missed  that  one  too. 

Potentially  the  most  explosive  situation  stewed  in  the  cauldron  of  national 
politics  in  the  late  summer  of  1944.  Republicans  were  preparing  to  run  Thomas 
E.  Dewey  for  President.  High  among  their  issues  was  the  charge  that  inexcus- 
able administration  laxity  had  permitted  the  Japanese  attack  at  Pearl  Harbor 
to  succeed  so  cruelly;  there  were  even  hints  that  President  Roosevelt  had 
deliberately  invited  the  attack  to  get  the  country  into  “his”  war  over  strong 
isolationist  sentiment.  Buttressing  the  charge  was  the  knowledge,  circulating 
secretly  among  many  high  officials,  that  the  United  States  had  cracked  Japan- 
ese codes  before  Pearl  Harbor.  From  this,  many  Republicans  concluded  that 
the  decrypted  messages  had  warned  Roosevelt  of  Pearl  Harbor  and  that  he, 
with  criminal  negligence,  had  done  nothing  about  it.  This  was  false,  but 
evidence  to  the  contrary  was  not  available  and  many  men  believed  it. 

As  the  campaign  warmed  up,  bits  and  hints  about  magic  began  to  appear 
in  political  speeches.  Representative  Forest  A.  Harness  of  Indiana,  for 
example,  told  the  House  on  September  1 1 that  “the  Government  had  learned 
very  confidentially  that  instructions  were  sent  out  from  the  Japanese  Govern- 
ment to  all  Japanese  emissaries  in  this  hemisphere  to  destroy  the  codes.”  The 
chief  of  Army  intelligence,  Brigadier  General  Clayton  F.  Bissell,  reported 
these  incidents  to  Marshall,  who  saw  the  danger  of  further  revelations  in  the 
heat  of  contention  for  the  greatest  office  of  all.  Bissell  suggested  that  Marshall 
go  to  the  President  for  help  in  squelching  the  talk.  Marshall  didn’t  think  that 
would  do,  and  slept  on  it.  Next  morning  he  dictated  a three-page,  single- 
spaced letter  to  the  Republican  candidate  pointing  out  the  extreme  danger  of 
disclosing  the  magic  information.  Because  he  felt  that  the  success  of  his  appeal 
depended  on  Dewey’s  conviction  that  it  was  nonpolitical,  he  did  not  discuss 
the  matter  with  either  the  President  or  the  Secretary  of  War,  and  he  began  his 
letter,  “I  am  writing  you  without  the  knowledge  of  any  other  person  except 
Admiral  King  (who  concurs).” 

An  Army  security  officer,  tall,  slim  Colonel  Carter  W.  Clarke,  flew  out 
West  in  a B-25  bomber  to  deliver  the  letter  to  Dewey,  who  had  just  given  his 
first  campaign  speech  devoted  entirely  to  an  attack  upon  the  national  adminis- 
tration. Clarke  gave  the  sealed  letter  to  Dewey  on  the  afternoon  of  September 
26  in  a hotel  in  Tulsa,  Oklahoma.  Under  “Top  Secret”  and  “For  Mr.  Dewey’s 


i 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


605 


eyes  only,”  its  second  paragraph  stated:  “What  I have  to  tell  you  below  is  of 
such  a highly  secret  nature  that  I feel  compelled  to  ask  you  either  to  accept  it 
on  the  basis  of  your  not  communicating  its  contents  to  any  other  person  and 
returning  this  letter  or  not  reading  any  further  and  returning  the  letter  to  the 
bearer.” 

From  a paragraph  lower  down,  the  word  “cryptograph”  leaped  to  Dewey’s 
vision.  At  once  he  guessed  the  subject  of  the  letter,  and  since  he  had  already 
learned  the  basic  codebreaking  secret  from  a number  of  individuals,  and  felt 
in  any  case  that  as  a presidential  candidate  he  was  “not  in  a position  to  make 
blind  commitments,”  he  stopped  reading  and  returned  the  letter  to  Clarke. 

When  Clarke  got  back  to  Washington,  Marshall  discussed  Dewey’s  rejec- 
tion with  him  and  Bissell.  They  decided  that  the  matter  was  so  important  that 
they  had  to  try  again,  so  after  redrafting  the  first  part  of  the  letter,  he  sent 
Clarke — in  civilian  clothes  this  time — to  Albany.  Dewey,  who  was  then 
governor  of  New  York  State,  received  him  in  the  Executive  Mansion  on 
September  28,  but  declined  to  discuss  the  subject  or  read  the  letter  except  in 
the  presence  of  one  of  his  closest  advisors,  Elliott  V.  Bell,  State  Superinten- 
dent of  Banks.  He  wanted  to  have  corroboration  of  the  occurrence  in  case 
something  happened  to  Marshall,  and  for  the  same  reason  insisted  upon 
keeping  the  letter,  though  Marshall  had  asked  to  have  it  returned.  Clarke 
telephoned  Marshall,  who  agreed  to  these  conditions,  and  Dewey  then  came 
on  the  wire  and  promised  to  keep  the  letter  locked  up  in  his  most  secret  file. 
He  then  read  the  most  revealing  single  document  in  the  annals  of  cryptology: 

TOP  SECRET 

For  Mr.  Dewey's  eyes  only. 

27  September  1944. 

My  Dear  Governor:  Colonel  Clarke,  my  messenger  to  you  of  yesterday, 
September  26th,  has  reported  the  result  of  his  delivery  of  my  letter  dated  Septem- 
ber 25th.  As  I understand  him  you  (a)  were  unwilling  to  commit  yourself  to  any 
agreement  regarding  “not  communicating  its  contents  to  any  other  person”  in 
view  of  the  fact  that  you  felt  you  already  knew  certain  of  the  things  probably 
referred  to  in  the  letter,  as  suggested  to  you  by  seeing  the  word  “cryptograph,” 
and  (b)  you  could  not  feel  that  such  a letter  as  this  to  a presidential  candidate 
could  have  been  addressed  to  you  by  an  officer  in  my  position  without  the  know- 
ledge of  the  President. 

As  to  (a)  above  I am  quite  willing  to  have  you  read  what  comes  hereafter 
with  the  understanding  that  you  are  bound  not  to  communicate  to  any  other 
person  any  portions  on  which  you  do  not  now  have  or  later  receive  factual 
knowledge  from  some  other  source  than  myself.  As  to  (b)  above  you  have  my 
word  that  neither  the  Secretary  of  War  nor  the  President  has  any  intimation 
whatsoever  that  such  a letter  has  been  addressed  to  you  or  that  the  preparation 
or  sending  of  such  a communication  was  being  considered.  I assure  you  that  the 
only  persons  who  saw  or  know  of  the  existence  of  either  this  letter  or  my  letter 
to  you  dated  September  25th  are  Admiral  King,  seven  key  officers  responsible  for 
security  of  military  communications,  and  my  secretary  who  typed  these  letters 


606 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


I am  trying  my  best  to  make  plain  to  you  that  this  letter  is  being  addressed  to  you 
solely  on  my  initiative,  Admiral  King  having  been  consulted  only  after  the  letter 
was  drafted,  and  I am  persisting  in  the  matter  because  the  military  hazards 
involved  are  so  serious  that  I feel  some  action  is  necessary  to  protect  the  interests 
of  our  armed  forces. 

I should  have  much  preferred  to  talk  to  you  in  person  but  I could  not  devise 
a method  that  would  not  be  subject  to  press  and  radio  reactions  as  to  why  the 
Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Army  would  be  seeking  an  interview  with  you  at  this  par- 
ticular moment.  Therefore  I have  turned  to  the  method  of  this  letter,  with  which 
Admiral  King  concurs,  to  be  delivered  by  hand  to  you  by  Colonel  Clarke,  who, 
incidentally,  has  charge  of  the  most  secret  documents  of  the  War  and  Navy 
Departments. 

In  brief,  the  military  dilemma  is  this: 

The  most  vital  evidence  in  the  Pearl  Harbor  matter  consists  of  our  intercepts 
of  the  Japanese  diplomatic  communications.  Over  a period  of  years  our  crypto- 
graph people  analyzed  the  character  of  the  machine  the  Japanese  were  using  for 
encoding  their  diplomatic  messages.  Based  on  this  a corresponding  machine  was 
built  by  us  which  deciphers  their  messages.  Therefore,  we  possessed  a wealth  of 
information  regarding  their  moves  in  the  Pacific,  which  in  turn  was  furnished 
the  State  Department — rather  than  as  is  popularly  supposed,  the  State  Depart- 
ment providing  us  with  the  information — but  which  unfortunately  made  no 
reference  whatever  to  intentions  toward  Hawaii  until  the  last  message  before 
December  7th,  which  did  not  reach  our  hands  until  the  following  day, 
December  8th.* 

Now  the  point  to  the  present  dilemma  is  that  we  have  gone  ahead  with  this 
business  of  deciphering  their  codes  until  we  possess  other  codes,  German  as  well 
as  Japanese,  but  our  main  basis  of  information  regarding  Hitler’s  intentions  in 
Europe  is  obtained  from  Baron  Oshima’s  messages  from  Berlin  reporting  his 
interviews  with  Hitler  and  other  officials  to  the  Japanese  Government.  These  are 
still  in  the  codes  involved  in  the  Pearl  Harbor  events. 

To  explain  further  the  critical  nature  of  this  set-up  which  would  be  wiped  out 
almost  in  an  instant  if  the  least  suspicion  were  aroused  regarding  it,  the  battle 
of  the  Coral  Sea  was  based  on  deciphered  messages  and  therefore  our  few  ships 
were  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time.  Further,  we  were  able  to  concentrate 
our  limited  forces  to  meet  their  naval  advance  on  Midway  when  otherwise  we 
almost  certainly  would  have  been  some  3,000  miles  out  of  place.  We  had  full 
information  of  the  strength  of  their  forces  in  that  advance  and  also  of  the  smaller 
force  directed  against  the  Aleutians  which  finally  landed  troops  on  Attu  and 
Kiska. 

Operations  in  the  Pacific  are  largely  guided  by  the  information  we  obtain  of 
Japanese  deployments.  We  know  their  strength  in  various  garrisons,  the  rations 
and  other  stores  continuing  available  to  them,  and  what  is  of  vast  importance, 
we  check  their  fleet  movements  and  the  movements  of  their  convoys.  The  heavy 
losses  reported  from  time  to  time  which  they  sustain  by  reason  of  our  submarine 
action,  largely  result  from  the  fact  that  we  know  the  sailing  dates  and  routes  of 
their  convoys  and  can  notify  our  submarines  to  lie  in  wait  at  the  proper  points. 

* Actually  December  11.  Marshall  was  referring  to  Yoshikawa’s  message  of 
December  3,  Honolulu  to  Tokyo,  setting  up  Kuhn’s  signalling  system. 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


607 


The  current  raids  by  Admiral  Halsey’s  carrier  forces  on  Japanese  shipping  in 
Manila  Bay  and  elsewhere  were  largely  based  in  timing  on  the  known  movements 
of  Japanese  convoys,  two  of  which  were  caught,  as  anticipated,  in  his  destructive 


attacks. 

You  will  understand  from  the  foregoing  the  utterly  tragic  consequences  if 
the  present  political  debates  regarding  Pearl  Harbor  disclose  to  the  enemy, 
German  or  Jap,  any  suspicion  of  the  vital  sources  of  information  we  possess. 

The  Roberts’  report  on  Pearl  Harbor  had  to  have  withdrawn  from  it  all 
reference  to  this  highly  secret  matter,  therefore  in  portions  it  necessarily  ap- 
peared incomplete.  The  same  reason  which  dictated  that  course  is  even  more 
important  today  because  our  sources  have  been  greatly  elaborated. 

As  another  example  of  the  delicacy  of  the  situation,  some  of  Donovan’s 
people  (the  OSS)  without  telling  us,  instituted  a secret  search  of  the  Japanese 
Embassy  offices  in  Portugal.  As  a result  the  entire  military  attache  Japanese 
code  all  over  the  world  was  changed,  and  though  this  occurred  over  a year  ago, 
we  have  not  yet  been  able  to  break  the  new  code  and  have  thus  lost  this  invaluable 
source  of  information,  particularly  regarding  the  European  situation. 

A further  most  serious  embarrassment  is  the  fact  that  the  British  government 
is  involved  concerning  its  most  secret  sources  of  information,  regarding  which 
only  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Chiefs  of  Staff  and  a very  limited  number  of  other 
officials  have  knowledge. 

A recent  speech  in  Congress  by  Representative  Harness  would  clearly  suggest 
to  the  Japanese  that  we  have  been  reading  their  codes,  though  Mr.  Harness  and 
the  American  public  would  probably  not  draw  any  such  conclusion. 

The  conduct  of  General  Eisenhower’s  campaign  and  of  all  operations  in  the 
Pacific  are  closely  related  in  conception  and  timing  to  the  information  we  secretly 
obtain  through  these  intercepted  codes.  They  contribute  greatly  to  the  victory 
and  tremendously  to  the  saving  in  American  lives,  both  in  the  conduct  of  current 
operations  and  in  looking  towards  the  early  termination  of  the  war. 

I am  presenting  this  matter  to  you  in  the  hope  that  you  will  see  your  way 
clear  to  avoid  the  tragic  results  with  which  we  are  now  threatened  in  the  present 
political  campaign.

This  extraordinary  missive  put  Dewey  in  a grave  predicament.  He  felt  that 
the  Japanese  simply  could  not  be  using  the  same  code  in  September,  1944,  as 
they  had  been  in  November,  1941.  Profoundly  convinced  of  the  rightness  of 
his  cause  and  of  the  “dreadful  incompetence”  of  the  Democrats,  both  in  the 
country  and  the  world  as  a whole  and  at  Pearl  Harbor  in  particular,  he — and 
many  Republicans — might  well  have  thought  that  true  patriotism  actually 
called  for  exposing  some  three-year-old  secret  about  prewar  codes  to  prove 
his  point  and  elect  the  right  man  and  the  right  party  to  control  the  destinies 
of  a whole  nation.  For  with  that  exposure  furnishing  apparently  solid  evidence, 
the  Pearl  Harbor  charge  might  have  propelled  him  into  the  White  House.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Dewey  talked  the  matter  over  in  detail  with  Bell  and  with  Herbert  Brownell, 
his  two  closest  advisors.  He  weighed  these  arguments  and  the  prize  at  stake — 
leadership  of  the  most  powerful  country  in  history — against  the  possibility  of 
prolonging  a war  in  which  hundreds  of  Americans  were  dying  daily  and 
against  his  regard  for  Marshall  as  an  utterly  truthful  and  honorable  man. 
After  two  days  of  intense  deliberation,  he  decided  not  to  mention  the  code- 
breaking. 

Marshall  had  never  actually  asked  him  for  any  assurances,  and  Dewey 
never  communicated  his  decision  to  the  chief  of  staff.  But,  Marshall  acknow- 
ledged, “there  seemed  to  be  no  further  reference  to  the  matter  in  the  cam- 
paign.” Dewey  lost,  heavily.  Afterwards,  as  a gesture  of  appreciation,  Mar- 
shall sent  Bissell  to  Albany  with  copies  of  the  current  magic  to  show  Dewey 
how  it  was  helping  in  the  Pacific.  Dewey  told  Bissell  that  he  had  heard  that  a 
debate  on  Pearl  Harbor  was  going  to  be  held  in  Congress,  and  he  asked  whether 
Marshall  wanted  him  to  intervene  and  suppress  it.  When  Bissell  returned, 
Marshall  had  him  call  Dewey  and  say  that  Marshall  had  already  embarrassed 
him  with  requests  which  had  affected  his  personal  actions  and  that  he  would 
not  make  any  further  requests.  Dewey  replied  that  it  wasn’t  a matter  of  per- 
sonal embarrassment  but  of  the  progress  of  the  war.  Bissell  told  the  governor 
that  Marshall  had  anticipated  that  reply  and  still  had  no  request  to  make. 
Nevertheless,  the  debate  never  materialized.  The  episode  had  a final  echo  at 
Roosevelt’s  funeral,  when  Dewey  was  thrown  in  with  Marshall,  “I  asked  him 
to  come  to  the  War  Department  with  me.  He  did  and  we  showed  him  the 
situation  out  in  the  Pacific.  Showed  him  also  the  current  magic,  giving  the 
Japanese  movements  at  that  time,  and  made  as  plain  as  we  could  to  him  just 
what  the  importance  of  these  matters  were.  His  attitude  was  very  friendly  and 
very  gracious.” 

So  ended  the  last  and  most  serious  threat  to  the  security  of  American 
cryptanalysis.  The  Japanese  never  realized  the  ludicrous  transparency  of  their 
codes.  They  never  suspected  the  truth  behind  the  Yamamoto  incident.  And 
cryptanalysis  went  on  to  play  a role  in  the  struggle  against  Japan  even  beyond 
its  formal  end. 

The  cipher  war  in  the  Pacific  drew  to  its  conclusion  not  with  sagas  of  high 
drama  but  rather  with  a foam  of  poignant  vignettes.  There  was,  for  instance, 
the  time  when  a junior  communicator’s  wise-guy  thoughtlessness  robbed 
Halsey  of  the  classic  gun  duel  between  battleships  for  which  he  had  always 
yearned. 

It  happened  on  October  25,  1944,  during  the  Battle  for  Leyte  Gulf.  Halsey 
had  organized  within  his  3rd  Fleet  a Task  Force  34,  consisting  of  most  of  his 
battleships  and  cruisers.  Since  it  stayed  with  his  main  force,  it  was  largely  a 
paper  organization,  but  owing  to  a syntactical  ambiguity  in  a message,  Nimitz 
and  others  thought  it  was  a separate  body.  The  battle  ranged  over  an  enor- 
mous area,  and  while  Halsey’s  carriers  were  attacking  the  four  battleships  and 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


609 


two  carriers  of  the  Japanese  Northern  Force,  Admiral  Thomas  C.  Kinkaid 
sent,  in  clear,  a desperate  call  for  the  gunfire  of  Task  Force  34  ships.  While 
Halsey  was  speculating  over  the  effect  its  possible  interception  by  the  Japanese 
might  have  had,  Nimitz,  who  had  been  following  the  battle  by  radio,  sent 
him  a query:  “Where  is  Task  Force  34?” 

Naval  communication  procedure  called  for  the  head  and  the  tail  of 
messages — their  most  vulnerable  points — to  be  concealed  by  nulls  consisting 
of  meaningless  words.  This  “padding”  was  supposed  to  be  totally  alien  to  the 
text,  but  the  enciphering  ensign  in  Pearl  Harbor  violated  this  rule  when  he 
used  a phrase  that  was  “just  something  that  popped  into  my  head.”  Though 
he  correctly  set  the  padding  off  from  the  text  by  doubled  letters,  communica- 
tors on  Halsey’s  flagship  decided  against  removing  it  on  the  chance  that  it 
might  be  part  of  the  message.  Thus,  the  decipher  tape  that  they  rushed  to 
Halsey  read: 

From  cincpac  [Nimitz]  action  Com  Third  Fleet  [Halsey]  info  Cominch  [King] 

ctf  seventy  four  [Kinkaid]  X Where  is  repeat  where  is  Task  Force  thirty  four 

rr  the  world  wonders 

When  Halsey  read  this,  he  said,  “I  was  as  stunned  as  if  I had  been  struck 
in  the  face.  The  paper  rattled  in  my  hands.  I snatched  off  my  cap,  threw  it  on 
the  deck,  and  shouted  something  that  I am  ashamed  to  remember.  ...  I was 
so  mad  I couldn’t  talk.”  The  more  he  thought  about  this  apparent  insult,  the 
more  furious  he  became,  and,  a little  before  11  a.m.,  he  angrily  turned  Task 
Force  34  from  due  north  to  due  south  to  go  to  Kinkaid’s  aid.  “At  that  mo- 
ment,” he  said,  “the  [Japanese]  Northern  Force,  with  its  two  remaining 
carriers  crippled  and  dead  in  the  water,  was  exactly  42  miles  from  the  muzzles 
of  my  16-inch  guns.”  Though  the  carriers  were  later  finished  off,  the  mis- 
understanding cleared  up,  and  the  enciphering  ensign  chewed  to  bits  by 
Nimitz,  Halsey  had  lost  “the  opportunity  I had  dreamed  of  since  my  days  as  a 
cadet.” 

Bitterest  of  the  vignettes  depicts  a negation  of  America’s  total  communica- 
tions-intelligence  mastery  near  the  end  of  the  war — with  tragic  consequences. 
At  about  3 a.m.  on  July  30,  1945,  the  Japanese  submarine  1-58  encoded  a dis- 
patch reporting  that  three  hours  earlier  it  had  “released  six  torpedoes  and 
scored  three  at  battleship  of  Idaho  class  . . . definitely  sank  it.”  He  addressed 
it  to  6th  Fleet  and  to  Combined  Fleet  headquarters  and  transmitted  it  on  a 
standard  Japanese  naval  frequency. 

Americans  intercepted  it;  frupac  read  it;  and  within  13  hours  of  its 
transmission  had  the  report  in  Nimitz’  Advance  Headquarters,  on  Guam. 
The  position  given  was  approximately  that  of  the  heavy  cruiser  Indianapolis, 
which  on  July  26  had  delivered  a chunk  of  U-235  to  Tinian  for  the  first  atomic 
bomb.  But  nobody  at  Advance  Headquarters  checked  to  see  if  any  American 
battleships,  or  cruisers,  or  other  heavy  vessels,  were  missing.  Why,  nobody 


610 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


knows.  As  a result  of  this  and  other  blunders,  no  search  was  instituted  for  the 
swimming  crewmen  for  nearly  a week;  in  the  meanwhile,  nearly  900  American 
sailors  died  uselessly — the  greatest  disaster  at  sea  in  the  history  of  the  United 
States  Navy. 

American  cryptanalysts,  who  usually  strove  to  win  battles,  worked  to 
make  peace  when  they  solved  Japanese  messages  that  indicated  Japan’s 
desire  to  quit  the  war  before  the  atomic  bombs  had  devastated  her  and  opened 
the  era  of  nuclear  war.  Though  the  formation  of  a new  cabinet  in  April,  1945, 
implied  a mandate  to  seek  peace,  the  United  States  obtained  the  first  con- 
crete evidence  of  this  desire  on  July  13.  On  that  date,  President  Truman  and 
other  high  American  officials  read  an  instruction  of  Foreign  Minister  Shigen- 
ori  Togo  to  his  ambassador  in  Moscow,  Naotake  Sato.  Togo  urged  Sato  to 
see  the  Soviet  Foreign  Minister  before  the  Big  Three  conference  at  Potsdam 
and  tell  him  of  the  Emperor’s  strong  desire  to  end  the  war.  Explain,  Togo 
said,  that  the  only  real  obstacle  to  peace  was  the  Allies’  demand  for  uncon- 
ditional surrender.  If  this  were  insisted  upon,  he  said,  Japan  would  have  to 
continue  the  fight.  The  implication  was  that  another  surrender  formula  might 
bring  peace. 

In  the  next  few  days  additional  messages  were  intercepted  and  read  that 
threw  further  light  on  Japanese  intentions.  They  verified  the  view  of  many 
experts  on  Japan  that  a promise  to  preserve  the  Emperor  would  open  the  way 
to  a surrender  which  in  most  other  respects  would  be  unconditional.  Probably 
as  a result  of  this  cryptanalyzed  information,  America,  Britain,  and  Russia  at 
Potsdam  moderated  their  demands  from  an  unconditional  surrender  of  all 
Japan — which  would  have  threatened  the  throne  in  which  each  Japanese 
rooted  his  very  claim  to  being  Japanese  and  which  Togo  had  therefore  said 
would  be  unacceptable — to  an  unconditional  surrender  of  merely  the  military. 
The  Big  Three  hoped  to  end  the  war  without  having  to  use  the  atom  bomb, 
but  they  would  do  so  if  necessary.  Hence  the  Potsdam  Declaration  on  July  26 
offered  Japan  a choice  between  “unconditional  surrender  of  her  armed  forces” 
and  “prompt  and  utter  destruction.”  But  Japan,  unable  to  accept  the  former 
because  it  did  not  positively  promise  the  retention  of  the  Emperor,  embraced 
the  latter. 

The  fatal  glare  spread  first  over  Hiroshima.  The  traffic  analysts  of  the 
Tokumu  Han,  who  had  learned  how  to  predict  the  B-29  bombing  raids 
launched  from  Tinian,  listed  the  special  signal  of  the  single  bomber  that 
preceded  Hiroshima’s  obliteration.  Three  days  later,  they  heard  the  signal 
again.  Japan  had  no  air  force  to  alert,  and  the  analysts  could  not  tell  that  the 
plane  was  heading  for  Nagasaki.  But  they  knew  what  the  beeps  meant.  As 
they  mechanically  plotted  it,  they  were,  in  the  Japanese  phrase,  swallowing 
their  tears. 

For  Americans,  however,  magic  extended  its  efforts  even  beyond  the 
conclusion  of  hostilities.  The  United  States,  fearing  a possible  banzai  suicide 
resistance  by  Japanese  troops  in  Korea,  like  that  encountered  on  some  island 


The  Scrutable  Orientals 


611 


garrisons,  had  not  planned  to  occupy  the  peninsula  until  September  23,  and 
then  only  with  an  entire  army  corps.  But  American  cryptanalysts  disclosed 
that  the  Japanese  commander  there  was  appealing  to  his  own  government  to 
hasten  the  movement  of  American  troops  into  Korea.  This  proved  rather 
conclusively  that  no  adverse  reaction  need  be  expected,  and  so  a mere 
regiment  took  control  of  the  country  on  September  3 — three  weeks  early. 
Similar  considerations  aided  the  disarming  of  Japanese  troops  in  China  and 
Manchuria,  and  finally  expedited  the  peaceful  occupation  of  the  islands  of 
Japan  itself. 

What  happened  to  cryptology  during  World  War  II? 

The  war  worked  no  changes  as  basic  as  those  of  telegraphy,  which  revolu- 
tionized the  structure  of  cryptography,  or  of  radio,  which  ushered  cryptan- 
alysis into  the  world  as  a factor  of  importance.  Rather  it  enlarged,  accelerated, 
intensified  what  was  already  there.  This  held  true  even  in  the  two  most  note- 
worthy cryptologic  developments  of  the  war.  One  was  internal,  in  which  the 
changes  were  so  great  as  to  be  qualitative:  the  evolution  in  the  operations 
of  cryptography  and  the  techniques  of  cryptanalysis,  and  one  external : the 
elevation  of  cryptanalysis  from  just  one  among  many  sources  of  intelligence 
to  the  principal  one. 

All  this  resulted,  of  course,  from  the  immense  increase  in  the  use  of  radio. 
Blitzkrieg  required  the  closest  coordination  between  motorized  spearheads, 
air  support,  and  consolidating  infantry.  Global  conflict  demanded  global 
communications.  Unprecedented  volumes  of  traffic  streamed  through  radio 
channels.  To  handle  it,  huge  agencies  sprang  into  being. 

In  World  War  I,  the  U.S.  Army  and  Navy  had  about  400  persons  in 
cryptology  (excluding  cipher  clerks),  or  about  one  person  in  every  10,000  under 
arms.  In  World  War  II,  there  were  16,000  in  cryptology— 40  times  as  many— 
and  the  ratio  was  one  person  in  every  800.  In  World  War  I,  a handful  of 
officers  and  enlisted  men  in  the  Code  Compilation  Section  had  produced 
codes  for  the  whole  A.E.F.  In  World  War  II,  hundreds  of  privates  at  Arling- 
ton Hall  did  nothing  but  draw  up  key  patterns  for  the  tens  of  thousands  of 
m-209s  all  over  the  world  which  devoured  a new  pattern  once  every  eight  hours. 
(Eventually,  a linguist  on  the  Hall’s  think  squad  devised  a mechanism  that 
produced  the  patterns  automatically.)  In  1918,  a few  men  had  carried  the 
packages  of  codebooks  to  the  American  headquarters  that  received  them.  In 
1942,  Japan  was  faced  with  a major  logistics  task  in  distributing  new  code- 
books to  her  far-flung  forces.  Her  disastrous  pre-Midway  failure  to  do  the 
job  in  time  showed  that  codes  had  become  cargo  almost  as  essential  as  food 
or  ammunition.  Codes  and  ciphers  cloaked  even  more  secondary  forms  of 
messages — meteorological,  direction-finding,  airplane,  merchant  ships’.  Inter- 
cept stations  covered  the  globe.  Branches  and  subsections  sprouted  that  the 
science  had  never  known:  the  Signal  Security  Service  had  a special  section 
just  to  distribute  its  solutions,  another  one  just  to  improve  and  develop 


612 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


cryptographic  mechanisms.  Brass  hats  abounded.  Recruiting  drives  were 
mounted.  The  whole  paraphernalia  of  large  organizations  materialized. 
Cryptology  became  big  business. 

At  the  same  time,  cryptology  completed  an  evolution  in  the  two  core  areas 
of  cryptographic  operations  and  cryptanalytic  techniques.  World  War  I had 
left  both  of  them  depleted  and  inadequate.  Hand  encipherment  had  barely 
coped  with  the  message  load,  even  though  codes  furnished  a primitive  mech- 
anization. Brute  frequency  analysis  had  barely  sufficed  for  the  adfgvx,  even 
though  it  was  handled  by  a master.  The  1920s  began  to  furnish  the  tools  and 
ideas  for  which  this  lack  cried  out.  In  cryptography,  Vernam,  Hebern, 
Scherbius,  Damm,  and  Hagelin  invented  practicable  cipher  machines — 
secure,  portable,  rugged,  printing.  Governments  gradually  introduced  them 
into  service,  replacing  the  old  pencil-and-paper  methods.  In  cryptanalysis, 
Friedman  pioneered  with  statistical  methods.  Hill  opened  a window  on  the 
new  vistas  of  mathematics.  Cryptologic  agencies  hired  mathematicians  like 
Kunze  and  Kullback  and  Sinkov  as  cryptanalysts  and  purchased  tabulating 
machines  to  make  more  calculations.  Mathematics  generated  analytical  tech- 
niques of  great  precision  and  power.  These  trends,  which  were  still  just 
getting  under  way  in  1939,  accelerated  with  a rush  during  the  war  and  culmin- 
ated by  1945.  This  evolution  transformed  both  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis 
and  gave  each  a characteristic  it  still  has.  World  War  II  mechanized  crypto- 
graphy and  mathematized  cryptanalysis. 

This  development  of  cryptology’s  substance,  like  the  growth  of  its  ad- 
ministrative organization,  was  paralleled  by  the  enormous  amplification  of  its 
effects.  In  World  War  I,  cryptanalysis  played  a central  role  in  one  event  of 
high  significance — the  American  declaration  of  war  following  the  Zimmer- 
mann  telegram  disclosure.  In  World  War  II,  cryptanalysis  helped  make  pos- 
sible at  least  four  critical  events — Midway,  Yamamoto,  the  rapid  cutting  of 
Japan’s  lifeline,  the  defeat  of  the  U-boats.  Cryptanalysis  was  not  just  a tan- 
gential and  merely  helpful  factor;  it  was  a vital  one. 

Indeed,  the  higher  in  the  politico-military  realm  are  the  events,  the  more 
important  becomes  cryptanalysis.  At  the  front,  it  probably  stands  equal  with 
prisoner-of-war  intelligence  or  aerial  reconnaissance.  But  neither  of  these 
can  match  it  for  providing  insight  into  the  strategic  plans  of  top  generals 
or  the  basic  diplomatic  policy  of  a whole  country.  A spy  may  occasionally 
pluck  forth  a richer  nugget,  but  he  cannot  refine  the  quantity  of  ore  that  a 
cryptanalyst  can,  nor  can  he  command  the  credibility.  The  ungrudging 
tributes  of  the  two  German  spymasters  attest  to  this  superiority:  Walter 
Schellenberg’s  acknowledgment  that  the  assistance  rendered  him  by  the 
communications-intelligence  chiefs  “made  most  of  my  success  in  Secret 
Service  operations  possible,”  and  Wilhelm  Hottl’s  boast  that  his  Hungarian 
cryptanalysts  provided  him  with  “at  least  a hundred  successes  such  as  seldom 
fall  to  the  lot  of  a Secret  Service  working  in  the  ordinary  ways.”  General 
Arne,  chief  of  Italy’s  Servizio  Informazione  Militare,  listed  three  succinct 


The  Scrutable  Orientals  613 

reasons  why  intelligence  chiefs  like  cryptanalysis:  it  is  usually  the  cheapest, 
the  latest,  and  the  truest  source  of  information. 

After  the  war  was  over,  an  American  official  familiar  with  the  wartime 
value  of  codebreaking  said  that  it  had  shortened  World  War  II  by  a year. 
The  estimate  may  be  conservative:  a Japanese  victory  at  Midway  would 
probably  have  cost  the  United  States  more  than  a year  to  come  back.  When 
asked  about  the  value  of  the  wartime  codebreaking.  Vice  Admiral  Walter  S. 
Anderson,  a former  Director  of  Naval  Intelligence,  exclaimed  “It  won  the 
war!”  Hyperbole,  to  be  sure,  but  indicative  nevertheless.  In  fact,  the  letter  of 
General  Marshall,  who  was  certainly  in  a position  to  know,  tends  to  support 
the  hyperbole.  It  was  this  vital  importance  of  cryptology  that  was  new  in  the 
world.  No  one  could  have  articulated  in  1919  the  tribute  that  Representative 
Clarence  B.  Hancock  offered  at  the  end  of  1945  on  the  floor  of  the  Congress 
of  the  United  States : “I  believe  that  our  cryptographers  [cryptanalysts]  . . . 
did  as  much  to  bring  that  war  to  a successful  and  early  conclusion  as  any  other 
group  of  men.” 

For  in  World  War  II  cryptology  became  a nation’s  most  important 
source  of  secret  intelligence.

although  secret  writing  appears  in  Russia  in  the  simple  letter- 
substitutions  of  12th-  and  13th-century  manuscripts,  akin  to  those  of  medieval 
France  and  Germany,  political  cryptography  seems  to  have  first  come  to  the 
country  under  the  Westernizing  influence  of  Peter  the  Great. 

The  most  direct  evidence  outside  the  nation’s  archives  lies  in  the  records 
of  England’s  Decyphering  Branch,  whose  first  Russian  solution  is  dated  1719 
— the  37th  year  of  Peter’s  reign.  This  accords  well  with  what  one  might  expect. 
Peter  was  fascinated  by  technical  arts  of  all  kinds;  he  not  only  studied  them 
but  picked  up  their  tools  and  worked  at  them.  He  perhaps  heard  about  codes 
and  ciphers  during  his  visits  to  Holland  and  England  in  1697-98  and  Paris  in 
1717.  It  was  a time  when  official  nomenclators  were  formally  employed  by  the 
emergent  nations  of  Europe — and  when  cryptanalysts  were  paid  to  solve 
them.  If  he  himself  did  not  import  cryptography  to  Russia,  the  seeds  might 
have  been  planted  by  the  foreigners  that  Peter  imported  for  the  governmental 
reforms  that  began  in  1712.  The  new  structure  was  modeled  on  Sweden’s,  and 
perhaps  included  a cipher  office,  for  by  that  time  Sweden  had  had  more  than  a 
century  and  a half  of  cryptographic  experience — employing,  for  example,  a 
one-part  code  of  almost  4,000  groups  in  1700.  Secret  writing  thus  might  well 
have  been  among  the  new  and  useful  practices  that  Peter  adopted  in  trans- 
forming Russia  from  the  semibarbarism  of  Ivan  the  Terrible  to  a modern 
state. 

The  first  ciphers  used  by  Peter’s  ambassadors  in  London  were  as  primitive 
as  his  country  then  was,  and  had  no  more  security  than  first  ciphers  usually 
possess:  they  were  monalphabetic  substitutions.  The  plaintext  was  replaced 
with  secret  symbols  hardly  less  bizarre  to  the  insular  English  eye  than  the 
original  Cyrillic  letters  themselves.  Such  systems  served  at  least  until  1728. 
In  the  reign  of  Peter’s  strong-willed  daughter,  Elizabeth,  Russian  crypto- 
graphy suddenly  blossomed  forth  with  all  the  maturity  of  Europe’s  best.  In 
1754,  the  Russian  ambassadors  to  England  employed  a two-part  nomenclator 
of  3,500  elements,  including  homophones.  It  was  in  French,  which  was  then 
not  only  the  language  of  diplomacy  but  also  the  tongue  cultivated  in  most  of 
the  courts  of  Europe,  nowhere  more  slavishly  than  in  Russia's.  (Sweden,  too,

was  using  French-language  codes.)  Other,  smaller  two-part  nomenclators 
followed  at  frequent  intervals : one  of  900  elements  appeared  in  1755,  and  still

Russian  monalphabetic  key,  recovered  solved  by  England's  Decyphering  Branch , 1728 


The  next  year  Catherine  II — she  who  was  to  make  her  country  the  chief 
continental  power  of  Europe  and  to  become  known  as  “the  Great” — ascended 
the  imperial  throne.  Six  years  later,  the  codemakers  of  St.  Petersburg  experi- 
mented with  Russian  for  a two-part  nomenclator  of  1,500  elements.  By  1780 
they  had  returned  to  French.  It  was  on  a worksheet  for  this  code  that  an 
English  decypherer  noted  “many  nulls  beginning  and  ending  sentences” — 
authoritative  testimony  to  the  craft  of  the  Russian  cryptographers.  In  1784 
they  tried  something  new:  a kind  of  voluntary  superencipherment  in  which

the  initial  numbers  1,  2,  3,  or  4 of  a codegroup  could  be  replaced  at  will  by 
6,  7,  8,  or  9,  respectively,  or  left  unchanged.  Thus  que  was  represented  by 
either  3126  or  8126.  This  may  have  been  some  kind  of  an  economy  move,  for 
the  underlying  nomenclator  was  one-part;  if  so,  the  Russian  experts  saw 
quickly  that  it  was  a false  economy,  for  the  system  could  not  provide  enough 
security,  and  they  discarded  it  the  very  next  year  for  a new  two-part  nomen- 
clator.

Part  of  English  solution  of  Russian  dispatch  encoded  with  full  nomenclator,  1700s 


Annual  changes,  in  fact,  may  have  been  routine.  One  French-language 
chiffre  general  existed  for  1798  and  another  for  1799;  the  presence  of  a 
Russian-language  general  cipher  for  1798  in  addition  indicates  the  open- 
handedness  of  the  Foreign  Ministry  in  cryptography.  Sometimes  nomencla- 
tors  were  changed  or  canceled  before  the  year  was  out  if  they  were  suspected 
of  being  compromised.  On  January  22,  1800,  the  Foreign  Minister,  Count 
Nikita  Petrovich  Panin,  ordered  his  ambassador  in  Berlin  not  to  use  the  1799 
general  cipher,  which  was  thought  to  have  been  carried  off  by  the  enemy  with 
the  baggage  of  a Russian  general  during  the  French  revolutionary  wars.  A 
similar  suspicion  may  have  caused  the  Foreign  Ministry  to  discontinue  a code 
used  by  their  ambassadors  in  Madrid  and  Lisbon  after  only  about  ten  months 
of  use. 

The  Russians  exercised  great  cryptographic  prudence.  Panin  warned  the 
Berlin  ambassador:  “Your  confidential  reports  must  always  be  ciphered  with 
one  of  the  new  keys,  even  when  you  use  a courier.”  As  an  added  precaution, 
he  wrote  many  of  his  own  dispatches  in  invisible  ink  beneath  a cover-text. 
This  also  had  the  advantage  that  development  of  the  ink  would  indicate  rather 
pointedly  that  the  letter  had  been  tampered  with.  Once  he  wrote  to  Berlin 
that  “Not  having  at  hand  the  sympathetic  ink  that  I have  been  using,  I used 
lemon  juice  today  in  the  attached  confidential  letter;  consequently,  instead  of 
dipping  it  into  aqua  fortis,  it  must  be  heated.”  All  this  sophistication  suggests 
that  the  Czarina’s  cryptographers  learned  their  techniques  in  the  only  way 
they  really  can  be  learned — through  cryptanalysis.

For  among  the  Western  innovations  that  had  come  to  the  new  Russia 
was  the  exceedingly  valuable  one  of  black  chambers.  Situated,  like  those  of 
England,  France,  and  Austria,  in  the  post  offices,  they  employed  the  full 
battery  of  expert  openers,  seal-forgers,  translators,  and  cryptanalysts.  At 
least  some  of  the  latter  appear  to  have  been  German,  probably  hired  by 
Peter,  and  their  descendants  seem  to  have  maintained  a monopoly  in  this 
field  for  generations. 

The  black  chambers  were  in  operation  as  early  as  Elizabeth’s  reign,  and 
the  French  ambassador,  the  Marquis  de  la  Chetardie,  knew  full  well  that  they 
were  opening  his  dispatches.  But  they  were  enciphered,  and,  in  the  manner  of 
diplomats  everywhere,  he  felt  safe  because  he  thought  that  the  Russians  were 
too  dumb  to  break  his  cipher.  He  may  have  been  right  about  Russians,  but 
three  Germans  in  the  black  chamber  were  making  mince  pie  out  of  it.  He 
erred  in  writing  home  with  a deplorable  lack  of  gallantry  about  the  Czarina, 
remarking  that  she  was  “given  entirely  to  her  pleasures”  and  was  “so  frivo- 
lous and  so  dissipated.”  The  interceptions  were  seen  as  a matter  of  course  by 
Count  Aleksey  Bestuzhev-Ryumin,  grand  chancellor  of  the  imperial  court. 
He  had  been  waiting  to  strike  back  at  Chetardie,  who  had  organized  a cabal 
against  him  because  of  his  Anglophile  tendencies.  He  showed  the  solutions 
to  Elizabeth,  who,  blinded  by  her  own  French  leanings,  refused  to  believe  them 
until  he  deciphered  them  in  her  presence.  The  next  day,  June  17,  1744,  as 
Chetardie  entered  his  residence,  he  was  handed  a note  ordering  him  to  leave 
Russia  in  24  hours.  He  protested;  a Russian  began  reading  him  his  dispatches. 
“That’s  enough,”  he  said,  and  started  to  pack. 

At  the  turn  of  the  century,  cryptanalytic  information  was  still  informing 
Russian  foreign  policy.  Foreign  Minister  Panin  wrote  on  March  26,  1800, 
from  St.  Petersburg  to  his  ambassador  in  Berlin : “We  possess  the  ciphers  of 
the  correspondence  of  the  king  [of  Prussia]  with  his  charge  d'affaires  here:  in 
case  you  suspect  [Prussian  Foreign  Minister  Count  Christian  von]  Haugwitz 
of  bad  faith,  it  is  only  necessary  to  get  him  to  write  here  on  the  subject  in 
question  under  some  pretext,  and  as  soon  as  his  or  his  king’s  dispatch  is 
deciphered,  I will  not  fail  to  apprise  you  of  its  content.” 

Twelve  years  later,  Russian  cryptanalysis  played  an  obbligato  to  the 
grand  symphony  of  the  Russian  winter  in  inflicting  the  first  defeat  on  the 
hitherto  unconquerable  Napoleon.  That  military  genius,  though  not  quite  the 
cryptologic  moron  that  it  has  been  the  fashion  to  portray  him  as  being,  cer- 
tainly did  not  fully  appreciate  the  importance  of  a tough  cryptography.  He 
depended  upon  a single,  easy-to-solve  system  during  most  of  his  campaigns, 
including  the  Russian;  this  was  his  petit  chiffre,  a nomenclator  of  about  200 
groups.  Even  without  his  generals’  predilection  for  partial  encipherments,  the 
Napoleonic  cryptograms  must  have  crumpled  before  the  assault  of  the 
Russian  cryptanalysts.  How  the  solutions  helped  the  Russians  is  not  known, 
but  that  they  must  have  been  of  some  assistance  is  indicated  by  the  fact  that 
the  victorious  Czar,  Alexander  I,  cited  them  himself  when  reminiscing  about

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  war.  At  a state  dinner  that  he  gave  in  Paris  years  later  for  the  marshals  of 
France,  he  mentioned  having  read  secret  French  dispatches.  Marshal  Mac- 
donald, who  had  commanded  a corps  for  Napoleon,  recalled  that  one  of  the 
French  generals  had  defected  and  said,  “It  is  not  surprising  that  Your 
Majesty  was  able  to  decipher  them;  someone  gave  you  the  key.”  Alexander 
denied  it.  “He  assumed  a serious  air,”  Macdonald  related,  “placed  one  hand 
on  his  heart  and  raised  the  other.  ‘No,’  he  replied,  ‘I  give  you  my  word  of 
honor.’  ” His  cryptanalysts  would  have  been  proud  of  so  stout  a defense  of 
their  honor. 

During  the  nineteenth  century,  cryptanalysts  functioned  as  one  of  the 
Czar’s  chief  tools  of  despotism.  Libertarian  movements  were  growing  in- 
creasingly restive  and  radical.  One  way  in  which  the  Okhrana,  the  notorious 
secret  police,  kept  tabs  on  underground  workers  was  to  have  the  black 
chambers  read  the  letters  and  telegrams  of  suspects — as  well  as  most  foreign 
mail  and  a random  selection  of  the  domestic  post,  too. 

Permanent  black  chambers  were  established  in  the  post  offices  of  St. 
Petersburg,  Moscow,  Warsaw,  Odessa,  Kiev,  Kharkhov,  Riga,  Vilna,  Tomsk, 
and  Tiflis;  temporary  ones  were  set  up  elsewhere  when  needed.  Most  of  the 
experts  were  foreigners,  though  Russian  subjects ; a fair  number  were  Germans 
who  spoke  Russian  with  a heavy  accent,  apparently  because  they  secluded 
themselves  for  security’s  sake  from  their  neighbors.  Though  they  mostly 
worked  from  watch  lists,  they  became  so  sensitive  to  the  nuances  of  clandestine 
correspondence  that  they  could  detect  a suspicious  letter  from  an  insignificant 
blot  on  an  envelope,  a line  under  a name,  the  odd  formation  of  an  address. 
Letters  were  usually  opened  with  steam  or  a hot  wire  or  blade  under  the  wax 
seal,  but  one  dedicated  employee,  Karl  Zievert,  in  charge  of  the  Kiev  office 
(and  later  convicted  of  being  an  Austrian  spy),  invented  a device  that  elimi- 
nated all  possibility  of  telltale  wrinkles  or  scorches.  It  consisted  simply  of  a thin 
round,  polished,  flexible  stick  about  the  size  and  diameter  of  a knitting  needle, 
split  down  half  its  length.  Zievert  would  slide  this  under  the  flap  of  an  envelope 
at  the  corner,  catch  the  letter  in  the  slit,  furl  the  paper  around  the  needle, 
and  then  draw  it  out  without  noticeably  distending  the  envelope! 

Ciphers  posed  few  problems  for  the  official  meddlers.  The  black  chambers 
forwarded  the  cryptograms  they  had  light-fingered  to  the  Okhrana,  whose 
specialist  in  cryptanalysis,  Zybine,  displayed  almost  uncanny  powers.  The 
former  Okhrana  head  in  Moscow,  P.  Zavarzine,  has  given  a vivid  portrait  of 
him:  he  was  fortyish,  tall,  thin,  swarthy,  with  long  hair  separated  by  a part, 
and  with  a lively  and  piercing  look.  “He  was  a fanatic,  not  to  say  a maniac,  for 
his  work.  Simple  ciphers  he  cleared  up  at  a glance,  but  complicated  ciphers 
placed  him  in  a state  almost  of  a trance  from  which  he  did  not  emerge  until 
the  problem  was  resolved,”  said  the  police  chief. 

Zavarzine  had  to  send  for  him  once  in  1911  to  solve  an  intercept,  written 
in  secret  ink  and  consisting  largely  of  fractions,  which  nobody  in  the  Moscow 


PyccKan  Kpunmosiozun  619 

section  could  make  out  (apparently  the  black  chambers  of  Okhrana  prefec- 
tures had  staff"  members  who  could  solve  the  simpler  ciphers).  Zybine  arrived 
the  next  morning  from  St.  Petersburg  and  barely  greeted  Zavarzine  before 
asking  for  the  letter.  An  official  gave  him  a copy.  He  wanted  the  original.  He 
instantly  started  for  the  post  office  to  get  it,  but  was  told  that  it  had  already 
been  sent  on.  Zavarzine  lent  him  his  desk,  and  soon  Zybine  was  totally  im- 
mersed in  his  work,  scribbling  rapidly  on  papers  spread  before  him.  When 
Zavarzine  returned  to  invite  the  cryptanalyst  to  dinner,  he  had  to  call  him 
twice  before  he  answered,  and  to  insist  before  he  came.  At  table,  Zybine, 
still  in  a trance,  downed  a bowlful  of  soup,  then  turned  the  plate  over  and 
tried  to  write  on  its  back.  When  the  pencil  would  not  take,  he  started  on  his 
cuff's — all  the  time  completely  ignoring  his  hosts.  Suddenly  he  leaped  from 
his  chair  and  shouted,  “Tishe  idiote,  dalshe  budiote!” 

After  which  he  sat  down,  relaxed,  and  ate  his  dinner  like  a normal  man. 
He  explained  to  Zavarzine  that  the  repetitions  of  the  letters  had  given  him 
the  clue.  The  proverb  that  he  had  shouted,  meaning  “Who  walks  softly  goes 
far,”  served  as  the  key  for  the  cipher.  The  phrase  was  written  vertically. 
Each  of  its  letters  headed  a Caesar  alphabet  (in  Russian)  that  extended  out  to 
the  right;  these  rows  were  numbered.  The  ciphertext  fractions  that  formed 
the  ciphertext  were  composed  by  taking  as  numerator  the  number  of  the 
row  of  the  plaintext  letter  and  as  denominator  the  position  of  the  letter  in  the 
row.  Thus  1/3  would  mean  the  third  letter  in  the  first  row;  since  this  row  was 
headed  by  t,  1/3  would  represent  c[).  The  cipher,  a weak  homophonic  substi- 
tution, served  the  underground  as  one  of  its  standard  systems.  The  message 
told  of  sending  some  cardboard  boxes,  undoubtedly  loaded  with  explosives, 
to  Kiev  when  the  Czar  was  planning  a visit  there.  Zavarzine  promptly  slapped 
shadows  onto  the  addressees  of  the  letter  and  kept  them  from  blowing  up  their 
Little  Father. 

Zybine  said  that  he  had  been  defeated  by  a cryptogram  only  once,  in  a 
letter  sent  by  an  Austrian  spy.  “But  that  was  a long  time  ago,”  he  told 
Zavarzine.  “Today  it  wouldn’t  happen.”  The  last  head  of  the  Okhrana, 
Alexei  T.  Vassilyev,  also  speaks  of  Zybine,  though  he  does  not  give  his  name. 
In  one  case,  a raid  on  a house  in  Sevastopol  uncovered  a sheet  of  paper 
covered  with  figures.  Vassilyev  gave  it  to  Zybine,  who  suggested  that  the  chief 
telegraph  to  Sevastopol  for  a list  of  all  books  found  in  the  house.  A short  time 
after  Zybine  received  it,  he  placed  the  solution  before  Vassilyev;  it  was  based 
on  The  Duel  by  Aleksandr  Kuprin — which  was,  appropriately,  a novel  of 
protest  against  the  Russian  military  class.  Zybine  got  a raise  and  a decoration 
for  that  job.  On  another  occasion,  he  cracked  another  terrorist  missive  as  soon 
as  he  had  learned  from  Vassilyev  the  price  of  a pound  of  dynamite ! Vassilyev, 
who  seems  to  have  been  a little  awed  by  Zybine’s  mysterious  faculty,  says  that 
the  cryptanalyst  could  pick  out  nulls  and  nonsignificant  lines  at  a glance. 

The  most  popular  cipher  of  the  Russian  underground  seems  to  have 
derived  from  the  prisons  in  which  so  many  of  its  leaders  had  to  serve  time.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Intercommunication  among  the  inmates  was  strictly  forbidden.  But  the 
prisoners,  languishing  in  the  tomblike  solitude  of  their  gloomy  stone  casements, 
with  nothing  to  occupy  their  minds,  had  the  patience,  perseverance,  and 
ingenuity  to  outwit  their  jailers.  They  knocked,  using  the  number  of  taps  to 
indicate  the  rows  and  columns  of  a simple  checkerboard,  like  the  original 
Polybius  square,  sometimes  6 x 6 to  accommodate  the  35  letters  of  the  old 
Russian  alphabet,  more  often  five  across  and  six  down,  with  the  alternate 
letter  forms  eliminated.  In  English,  the  checkerboard  would  take  this  form: 


1 2 3 4 5 


1 

2 

3 

4 

5 


a b c d e 
f g h ij  k 
1 m n o p 
q r s t u 
v w x y z 


Thus  hello  would  become  23  15  31  31  34.  Prisoners  quickly  memorized  the 
proper  numbers  and  “talked”  at  from  10  to  15  words  a minute.  The  system 
was  universal  in  the  penal  institutions  of  Russia,  with  felons  as  well  as 
political  convicts  employing  it. 

One  of  its  advantages  was  that  it  afforded  communication  by  a great  variety 
of  media — anything  that  could  be  dotted,  knotted,  pierced,  flashed,  or  indi- 
cate numerals  in  any  way  could  be  pressed  into  service.  It  often  concealed  a 
message  within  an  innocuous  handwritten  letter.  The  ciphertext  numbers  were 
indicated  by  the  number  of  letters  written  together;  breaks  in  the  count  were 
indicated  by  minute  and  almost  imperceptible  spaces,  much  as  occur  naturally 
in  many  persons’  handwriting.  Spaces  between  words  were  bridged  by  having 
the  last  letter  of  a word  end  in  an  upstroke  if  the  count  was  to  continue,  in  a 
downstoke  if  the  end  of  the  word  coincided  with  the  end  of  a count.  This 
subtle  means,  in  which  the  cover-text  bears  no  relation  to  the  underlying 
message,  and  so  does  not  have  to  strain  to  make  sense,  frequently  bootlegged 
secrets  in  and  out  of  prisons,  and  undoubtedly  past  the  noses  of  the  black 
chamber  experts,  until  they  finally  caught  on. 

The  popular  cipher  that  the  checkerboard  inspired  is  named  for  the 
Nihilists,  the  anarchistic  opponents  of  the  czarist  regime,  who  may  have  in- 
vented it.  The  Nihilist  cipher  converts  both  the  plaintext  and  a repeating 
keyword  into  numerical  form  via  the  checkerboard,  and  then  adds  them 
together  to  produce  the  ciphertext.  If  the  keyword  is  ARISE,  or  1 1 42  24  43 
15,  the  plaintext  Bomb  Winter  Palace  would  be  enciphered  like  this: 


literal  plain  bombwinterpa  lace 
numerical  plain  12  34  32  12  52  24  33  44  15  42  35  11  31  11  13  15 
key  11  42  24  43  15  11  42  24  43  15  11  42  24  43  15  11 


ciphertext 


23  76  56  55  67  35  75  68  58  57  46  53  55  54  28  26 


PyccKan  Kpunmojiozun  621 

Occasional  three-digit  groups  will  occur,  as  55+54  = 109.  The  cipher  is  a 
kind  of  modified  numerical  Vigenere  with  additional  weaknesses  that  simplify 
solution.  It  would  not  have  baffled  a Zybine  very  long.  Yet  this  basic  system — 
the  adding  of  a key  to  a checkerboard  substitution,  though  with  important 
improvements — survived  through  the  years  to  become  the  primary  form  of 
secret  communication  for  Russian  undercover  agents. 

Only  one  other  department  of  Russian  officialdom  coddled  cryptology  as 
did  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior’s  Okhrana:  the  Foreign  Ministry.  It  employed 
six  or  seven  codes,  most  of  only  1,000  elements,  the  more  important  of  which 
were  superenciphered  by  a table  of  30  number  alphabets.  Keys  varied  from 
day  to  day,  and  deliberate  “errors”  were  reportedly  made  to  muddy  the 
statistics  of  enemy  cryptanalysts ; these  naturally  had  to  be  eradicated  by  the 
cipher  clerks  before  they  could  read  their  own  messages.  The  wily  Russians 
also  employed  a code  that  they  knew  had  been  solved  by  other  nations  to 
keep  the  foreign  cryptanalysts  happy  and  productive  and  away  from  the 
important  codes.  Still,  Russian  codes  were  read,  either  by  bribery  or  by  solu- 
tion. At  least  one  of  the  cryptanalyses  of  a Russian  diplomatic  code  was  made 
through  the  classic  entry  of  guessing  that  a message  ended  with  a full  stop. 

Inheriting,  perhaps,  the  cryptanalytic  service  that  had  solved  the  dispatches 
of  diplomats  during  the  times  of  Elizabeth  and  of  Catherine  the  Great,  the 
Foreign  Ministry  impartially  read  the  coded  messages  of  friends  and  foes 
alike : Turkey  and  Austria-Hungary  in  the  latter  category,  France  and  England 
in  the  former,  and  Sweden,  a neutral,  in  neither.  Just  before  World  War  I,  the 
Foreign  Office  cryptologic  organization  was  streamlined  by  Aleksandr  A. 
Savinsky,  chief  of  the  ministry’s  cabinet  from  1901  to  1910.  He  placed  the 
cryptanalysts  directly  under  the  minister,  introduced  new  codes,  and  promul- 
gated strict  regulations  for  their  employment. 

The  Ministry  of  War,  on  the  other  hand,  meant  well,  but  outside  factors 
defeated  its  efforts.  In  1910,  Major  Cartier  came  from  France  to  prepare  signal 
and  cryptographic  liaison  with  Russia.  The  following  year  he  came  again  with 
a supersecret  codebook,  complete  with  superencipherment,  of  which  only 
eight  copies  had  been  printed  by  the  French  Army’s  geographic  service.  Four 
were  retained  by  the  French  War  and  Marine  ministries;  Cartier  smuggled 
the  other  four — for  the  corresponding  Russian  ministries — across  the  border 
in  his  luggage  amid  novels  and  Russian-French  dictionaries.  Soon  thereafter 
he  learned  that  the  shifty-eyed  Tartar  officer  to  whom  he  had  delivered  the 
two  books  for  the  War  Ministry  had  sold  one  of  them  to  the  Germans. 

This  typified  the  atmosphere  of  corruption  that  infected  the  entire  Russian 
military  establishment  before  World  War  I.  The  lover  of  the  young  wife  of  the 
elderly  Minister  of  War  dined  with  the  Kaiser  and  held  five  German  decora- 
tions; the  not  unnatural  suspicions  that  he  was  a German  spy  were  later 
confirmed.  Russia  had  herself  scored  one  of  the  most  spectacular  spy  coups  of 
modern  times  when  it  blackmailed  the  homosexual  Colonel  Alfred  Redl  into 


622 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


betraying  the  strategic  plans  that  the  Austro-Hungarian  general  staff  had 
drawn  up  for  use  in  the  expected  war  against  the  Slavs.  Fear  of  a Russian 
Redl  had  kept  Colonel  Andreiev,  in  charge  of  the  Army’s  cipher  bureau, 
from  distributing  copies  of  the  new  and  secret  cipher  that  he  had  drawn  up  for 
war  use  until  the  very  last  minute. 

His  caution  bred  disaster. 

The  Russian  plan  of  campaign  against  Germany  in  1914  called  for  an  in- 
vasion of  East  Prussia  by  two  armies.  The  1st  Army  was  to  drive  straight  west 
into  that  province  and  grip  the  German  defenders  tightly  in  battle.  The  2nd 
Army,  to  the  south,  was  to  circle  around  the  Masurian  Lakes,  come  up 
behind  the  Germans,  block  their  retreat,  and  destroy  them.  This  strategy 
naturally  required  careful  timing  and  close  collaboration  between  the  two 
forces.  Unfortunately,  Russian  communications  were  woefully  inadequate. 
The  2nd  Army  had  only  350  miles  of  wire  all  told  to  string  during  its  advance 
across  the  plains  of  Poland;  this  pitiful  supply  contrasts  sharply  with  the 
2,500  miles  of  wire  later  used  in  a single  day  by  an  A.E.F.  army  on  the 
Western  Front.  At  the  same  time  radios  were  issued  only  to  the  headquarters 
of  both  armies  and  the  headquarters  of  their  immediate  subordinates — their 
corps.  Division  and  lower  headquarters  lacked  them.  The  several  corps  head- 
quarters therefore  used  their  wire  to  link  up  with  their  divisions.  Since  army 
headquarters  had  exhausted  their  meager  wire  supplies  in  stringing  lines  to 
the  rear  commands,  this  left  wireless  as  the  only  means  of  communication 
among  the  several  corps  headquarters  and  between  them  and  their  army 
headquarters — the  two  highest  echelons  of  field  command. 

Their  messages  lay  naked  to  the  enemy.  The  general  inefficiency  that 
crippled  the  Russian  mobilization  had  fouled  up  distribution  of  the  new 
military  cipher  and  its  keys.  Within  a single  army  (the  2nd),  for  instance,  the 
XIII  Corps  did  not  have  the  key  needed  to  read  cryptograms  from  its  im- 
mediate neighbor,  the  VI  Corps.  The  war  broke  out  August  4.  Before  a fort- 
night had  passed  Russian  signalmen  were  no  longer  even  trying  to  encipher 
messages,  but  were  passing  them  over  the  radio  in  the  clear. 

In  accordance  with  the  Russian  strategy,  General  Pavel  Rennenkampf, 
commanding  the  1st,  or  northern,  Army,  began  moving  into  East  Prussia  on 
August  17.  The  German  general  staff  had  long  foreseen  the  two-pronged 
attack — the  terrain  made  it  obvious.  They  had  left  only  one  army  to  defend 
East  Prussia  because  their  strategy  called  for  a quick  and  decisive  victory 
against  France  first.  This  single  force  was  approximately  as  strong  as  either 
Russian  army  but  desperately  weaker  than  both  combined,  and  the  general 
staff  had  dictated  as  its  strategy  to  strike  with  all  possible  strength  at  the  first 
Russian  force  within  reach,  then  to  turn  and  attack  the  second.  East  Prussia 
was  the  homeland  of  the  Junkers.  The  Germans  preferred  not  to  yield  it  to 
the  hideous  trampling  of  the  Slav. 

They  gave  battle  to  Rennenkampf  at  Gumbinnen.  Under  a hammering 


PyccKan  Kpunmonoaun  623 

Russian  artillery  barrage,  the  German  troops  broke  and  fled  1 5 miles  to  the 
rear  before  they  could  be  halted.  The  frightened  German  commander  pre- 
pared to  fall  back  to  the  Vistula  River  and  abandon  East  Prussia.  He  reported 
his  intentions  to  the  German  high  command,  which  promptly  began  looking 
for  a replacement.  But  his  brilliant  First  Chief  Staff  Officer,  Colonel  Max 
Hoffmann,  pointed  out  that  the  southern  Russian  army  had  already  invaded 
so  far  that  its  left  wing  was  actually  closer  to  the  Vistula  than  the  German 
rear  and  so  was  in  a position  to  cut  off  the  German  retreat.  He  convinced  his 
chief  that  he  had  to  strike  against  this  wing  to  give  the  German  army  freedom 
to  maneuver,  if  only  to  reach  the  safety  of  the  Vistula.  The  Germans  had 
somewhat  mauled  the  Russian  bear  before  their  rout,  and  Rennenkampf,  in- 
stead of  pursuing  to  turn  victory  into  triumph,  had  paused  to  lick  his  wounds. 
Hoffmann  was  confident  that  he  would  rest  another  day  or  two.  He  proposed, 
and  his  general  agreed,  to  disengage  two  German  corps  from  the  front  against 
Rennenkampf,  switch  them  southward  over  the  excellent  network  of  German 
railroads,  and  fall  upon  the  Russian  southern  prong  with  surprise. 

The  movement  was  in  its  early  stages  when  the  new  German  commander, 
Paul  von  Hindenburg,  and  his  chief  of  staff,  Erich  Ludendorff,  who  really 
ran  the  show,  arrived  and  confirmed  it.  The  difficult  entrainment  process 
began.  Ludendorff  flung  out  a screen  of  cavalry  along  the  northern  battle  line 
to  conceal  the  withdrawal  of  his  troops  and  to  keep  Rennenkampf  under  ob- 
servation. The  division  of  forces  violated  the  German  strategic  doctrine  of 
concentration,  and  the  question  arose  as  to  whether  all  German  forces  should 
be  thrown  into  the  battle  against  the  southern  force,  commanded  by  General 
Aleksandr  Samsonov.  To  do  so  would  almost  ensure  victory,  but  it  would 
also  leave  the  German  rear  entirely  unprotected  from  an  attack  by  Rennen- 
kampf. While  the  German  staff  was  discussing  the  pros  and  cons  of  this  move 
on  the  evening  of  August  24,  a motorcyclist  brought  in  two  Russian  intercepts. 
They  had  been  forwarded  on  the  initiative  of  the  head  of  the  radio  station  at 
the  German  fortress  at  Konigsberg.  His  operators,  who  had  little  traffic  of 
their  own  to  transmit,  had  begun  listening  in  to  the  Russian  transmissions 
as  a diversion. 

Both  messages  were  from  the  headquarters  of  Samsonov’s  XIII  Corps, 
which  was  communicating  with  army  headquarters  by  radio  because  that 
was  the  only  means  the  corps  had.  And  both  were  in  the  clear  because  XIII 
Corps  had  never  received  the  proper  cipher  key.  They  specified  exactly  where 
the  corps  was  going,  when  it  expected  to  be  there,  and  what  it  would  do  next. 
Was  it  a trick?  No,  because  these  details  were  perfectly  consistent  with  an 
overall  Russian  directive  that  had  been  found  in  the  wallet  of  a dead  Russian 
officer  the  day  before.  The  intercepts  did  not  answer  the  crucial  question  of 
Rennenkampf ’s  intentions.  But  Ludendorff  decided  that,  with  this  intelligence, 
the  likelihood  of  overwhelming  victory  over  Samsonov  was  worth  risking 
defeat  by  Rennenkampf.  The  orders  went  out  to  march  the  remaining  troops 
facing  Rennenkampf  across  the  short  inner  distance  between  the  two  pincers.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  march  was  getting  under  way  next  morning  as  Ludendorff  and  Hin- 
denburg  appeared  at  headquarters  in  Marienburg.  But  Ludendorff  was  not 
entirely  free  of  anxiety  about  what  he  had  done;  second  thoughts  disturbed 
him.  His  thin  line  of  cavalry  could  have  been  easily  pierced  by  the  Russian  1st 
Army.  Rennenkampf  s formidable  host  hung  like  a threatening  thunder- 
cloud to  the  northeast,”  he  worried.  “He  need  only  have  closed  with  us  and 
we  should  have  been  beaten.”  Their  defeat  would  have  meant  a tremendous 
moral  blow  to  the  German  cause,  loss  of  the  country’s  richest  grain  and  dairy 
lands,  and  possibly  the  fall  of  the  only  barrier  between  the  Russian  steam- 
roller and  Berlin.  Should  he  perhaps  have  been  a little  more  cautious?  While 
there  was  yet  time,  should  he  leave  some  troops  to  block  Rennenkampf?  Or 
should  he  even  call  off  the  whole  offensive  against  Samsonov  and  turn  back 
against  Rennenkampf?  So  much  was  at  stake,  and  it  rested  upon  little  more 
than  his  soldier’s  intuition  that  Rennenkampf  would  merely  crawl  forward 
as  he  repaired  his  supply  lines  and  refitted  his  troops. 

But  at  headquarters  that  morning  there  arrived  what  at  one  stroke  lifted 
the  burden  from  the  minds  of  Ludendorff  and  Hoffmann  and  permitted  them 
to  prepare  one  of  the  great  military  triumphs  of  the  war.  It  was  a Russian 
intercept.  It,  too,  was  in  clear,  but  this  one  was  from  Rennenkampf  to  his  IV 
Corps,  and  it  read,  in  part : 

The  army  will  continue  its  attack.  On  August  25  it  will  reach  the  Wiberln- 
Saalau-Norkitten-Potauren-Nordenburg  line;  on  August  26  the  Damerau- 
Petersdorf-Wehlau-Allenburg-Gerdauen  line. 

Their  maps  told  the  Germans  that  Rennenkampf  was  still  moving  at  his 
snail’s  pace.  The  evidence  of  hasty  German  departure  that  the  Russian 
general  had  seen  as  he  advanced  leisurely  upon  their  evacuated  positions  had 
confirmed  his  erroneous  opinion  that  the  Germans  were  in  full  retreat  after 
Gumbinnen.  He  did  not  want  to  press  them  too  much  for  fear  of  forcing  them 
to  the  Vistula  before  Samsonov  could  crush  them.  The  Germans,  however, 
saw  at  once  that  he  could  not  reach  any  position  in  time  to  attack  the  German 
rear  before  the  expected  destruction  of  Samsonov  was  complete.  Relieved, 
they  concentrated  at  once  on  engineering  that  destruction. 

Later  that  morning,  as  the  German  commanders  were  returning  to  head- 
quarters from  a conference  at  a corps  headquarters,  they  stopped  at  a railway 
station  in  Montovo  for  news.  A signalman  handed  Hoffmann  still  another 
Russian  intercept — also  in  clear.  Samsonov  had  sent  it  to  the  cipherless  XIII 
Corps  at  6 a.m.  It  was  a long  dispatch,  and  Hindenburg  and  Ludendorff  had 
already  driven  off  when  Hoffmann  got  it  all.  He  sped  after  them  in  his  own 
car,  overtook  them,  and,  as  the  two  automobiles  jounced  side  by  side  along 
the  rutted  Polish  road,  handed  it  over.  Hindenburg  stopped  his  car,  and  the 
officers  studied  it: 

...  On  25  August  the  2nd  Army  proceeds  to  the  Allenstein-Osterode  line;  the 
main  strength  of  the  army  corps  occupies:  XIII  Corps  the  Gimmendorf-Kurken 


PyccKan  KpunmoAozun  627 

line;  XV  Corps  Nadrau-Paulsgut;  XXIII  Corps  Michalken-Gr.  Gardienne 

The  I Corps  to  remain  in  District  5,  to  protect  army’s  left  flank  .... 

It  was,  in  fact,  nothing  less  than  a full  roundup  of  the  situation  as  Samsonov 
saw  it,  together  with  the  most  detailed  and  explicit  moves  to  be  followed  by 
his  army.  It  gave  the  Germans  a knowledge  of  enemy  intentions  unprecedented 
in  the  whole  of  military  history.  It  was  like  reading  the  mind  of  a chess  op- 
ponent, like  playing  blindman’s  buff  without  the  blindfold.  It  was  almost  im- 
possible to  lose. 

The  Germans  formulated  their  plans  to  take  advantage  of  the  weaknesses 
of  the  Russian  dispositions.  They  plotted  a double  envelopment  of  Samsonov, 
and  it  worked  to  perfection.  General  combat  opened  the  next  day,  the  26th. 
One  of  the  Germans  corps  marching  down  from  Rennenkampf’s  front  struck 
hard  at  Samsonov’s  right ; during  the  night,  that  wing  was  turned.  Before  dawn 
on  the  27th,  a hurricane  barrage  of  artillery  demoralized  the  hungry,  tired 
troops  of  his  left  flank,  and  before  noon  they  had  fled  the  field  without  a 
single  serious  German  infantry  assault.  Soon  the  realization  penetrated  to 
Samsonov  that  instead  of  the  Russians  crushing  a retreating  German  Army, 
that  army  had  in  fact  almost  enveloped  him.  His  XIII  and  XV  Corps,  in  the 
center,  fought  bravely  in  the  confused,  surging  struggle,  but  the  frantic  orders 
and  cries  for  help  that  their  radios  squealed  in  clear  were  all  heard  by  the 
Germans  who,  fully  informed,  could  exploit  a gap  here,  a movement  there. 
Bit  by  bit  the  Germans  drove  in  behind  the  two  corps  from  both  sides;  soon 
the  Russians  found  themselves  fighting  both  front  and  rear.  By  the  30th,  the 
Germans  had  encircled  the  corps  with  a ring  of  steel  from  which  only  2,000 
Russians  escaped.  This  ended  the  battle:  there  were  no  Russians  left  to 
fight.  By  then  Samsonov  was  dead.  He  had  shot  himself  in  despair  as  he  and 
his  staff  stumbled  through  the  forest  in  the  dark  night  of  defeat. 

Gradually,  it  became  clear  to  the  Germans  that  they  had  won,  as  Hoffmann 
wrote,  “one  of  the  great  victories  in  history.”  Almost  100,000  Russians  were 
taken  prisoner.  An  estimated  30,000  were  dead  or  missing.  The  Russian  2nd 
Army  had  ceased  to  exist.  One  of  the  few  battles  of  the  entire  war  that  was  a 
decisive  victory,  Tannenberg — as  the  Germans  named  it — demonstrated  that 
the  Russian  steamroller  was  not  quite  the  invincible  machine  that  had  terror- 
ized central  Europe.  It  catapulted  Hindenburg  to  a popularity  that  carried 
him,  later  in  the  war,  to  supreme  command,  and,  in  peace,  to  the  presidency 
of  his  country.  Pro-German  groups  in  Russia  began  to  agitate  for  a with- 
drawal from  the  war.  Russian  morale  sank. 

Hoffmann,  the  architect  of  the  victory,  acknowledged  its  real  cause.  "We 
had  an  ally  that  I can  only  talk  about  after  it  is  all  over — we  knew  all  the 
enemy’s  plans.  The  Russians  sent  out  their  wireless  in  clear.  The  case  was 
clear-cut.  Interception  of  unenciphered  communications  had  awarded  the 
Germans  their  triumph.  Tannenberg,  which  gave  Russia  the  first  push  on  her 
long  slide  into  ruin  and  revolution,  was  the  first  battle  in  the  history  of  the 
world  to  be  decided  by  cryptologic  failure.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


So  inexhaustible  were  the  manpower  resources  of  Russia  that  not  even  a 
debacle  like  Tannenberg  could  cripple  its  war  effort.  “We  are  happy  to  make 
such  sacrifices  for  our  allies,”  replied  the  Grand  Duke  Nicholas,  commander 
in  chief  of  the  Russian  armies,  when  the  French  ambassador  expressed  his 
condolences.  And  even  though  the  Germans  turned  on  Rennenkampf  and 
drove  him  out  of  East  Prussia  in  the  Battle  of  the  Masurian  Lakes,  two  Rus- 
sian armies  pounded  the  Austro-Hungarian  forces  back  through  Lvov  with 
such  force  that  they  retreated  almost  to  Krakow.  Meanwhile,  though  still 
plagued  with  shortages  of  all  kinds,  including  signal  equipment,  the  Russians 
finally  managed  to  distribute  their  cipher  system  to  all  commands  by  the 
middle  of  September.  On  the  14th,  the  Stavka,  the  Russian  high  command, 
prescribed  its  use  for  all  military  orders. 

The  system  was  a numerical  polyalphabetic  which  negated  most  of  the 
advantages  of  polyalphabeticity  by  enciphering  several  letters  in  succession  in 
a single  cipher  alphabet.  It  resembled  the  feeble  cipher  used  by  Cornwallis  in 
the  American  Revolution  and  solved  with  ease  by  James  Lovell.  Along  the 
top  of  its  tableau  were  listed  33  letters  of  the  Russian  alphabet;  the  tableau 
proper  consisted  of  eight  lines  of  two-digit  numbers  in  mixed  order.  Each  line 
differed  from  the  others,  and  they  were  numbered  at  the  left  in  mixed  order. 
In  enciphering,  these  cipher  alphabets  were  used  in  rotation,  the  one  num- 
bered 1 first,  the  one  numbered  2 second,  and  so  on.  Each  alphabet  enciphered 
several  letters  at  a time.  The  number  of  letters  to  be  enciphered  in  a given 
alphabet  before  the  next  came  into  play  lay  at  the  whim  of  the  encipherer, 
who  informed  the  decipherer  of  this  number  by  writing  it  out  five  times  and 
then  placing  this  group  at  the  head  of  the  cryptogram.  If  he  wished  to  change 
this  number  during  a message,  he  simply  repeated  the  new  encipherment 
group  length  five  times,  inserted  it  into  the  body  of  the  cryptogram,  and  used 
that  length  from  then  on. 

Cryptograms  in  the  Russian  Army  cipher  thus  consisted  of  groups  of 
monalphabetically  enciphered  letters,  with  the  length  of  the  groups  clearly 
indicated  by  the  unmistakable  appearance  of,  say  a 99999  (the  maximum 
length)  or  a 66666.  Aside  from  being  vulnerable  to  the  usual  techniques  of 
frequency  analysis,  the  cipher  would  often  mirror  the  telltale  repeated-letter 
pattern  of  an  underlying  plaintext  word,  such  as  attack  or  division,  that  had 
fallen  entirely  within  a single  encipherment  group  and  so  had  been  mon  - 
alphabetically  enciphered.  Such  a system  does  not  interpose  insuperable 
difficulties  to  the  cryptanalyst,  especially  when,  as  with  the  Russians,  it  was 
poorly  used,  often  with  intermixture  of  plaintext.  Mixed  text  was  soon  pro- 
hibited, but  by  then  it  was  too  late. 

For  the  brilliant  young  Captain  Hermann  Pokorny,  head  of  the  Russian 
subsection  of  the  Austro-Hungarian  Dechiffrierdienst,  had  cracked  the  system 
and  reconstructed  all  its  alphabets  by  September  19.  His  first  important  solu- 
tion, on  September  25,  disclosed  General  Novikov’s  lengthy  report  of  his 
reconnaissance  of  Central  Powers  troops,  with  his  additional  note:  “I  took 


PyccKax  KpunmoAozun  629 

the  decision  of  not  crossing  the  Vistula.”  The  message  was  dated  8:40  a.m.; 
by  4 p.m.  the  Austrian  liaison  officer  had  brought  it  to  the  attention  of  the 
German  headquarters.  Knowledge  of  Novikov’s  decision  determined  the 
initially  successful  Austro-German  tactics  of  the  battles  of  the  Vistula  and 
San  rivers.  Other  intercepts  were  valuable  in  more  local  situations.  A message 
of  Prince  Engalitschev,  colonel  of  the  10th  Russian  Cavalry  Division,  warned 
of  a strong  attack  on  the  fortress  of  Przemysl ; the  prepared  commander  easily 
warded  it  off  until  the  Austrian  advance  forced  the  Russians  to  lift  the  siege 
in  mid-October.  During  this  advance,  Pokorny’s  group  solved  as  many  as  30 
cryptograms  a day. 

It  was  at  about  that  time  that  the  Russians  made  their  first  key  change.  It 
apparently  consisted  only  of  altering  the  order  in  which  the  cipher  alphabets 
were  to  be  used,  the  alphabets  themselves  remaining  unchanged.  Solution  of 
this  would  have  taken  Pokorny  at  most  a few  minutes.  Any  difficulty  that  he 
might  have  encountered  evaporated  when  a Russian  station  repeated  in  the  old 
key  a message  already  sent  in  the  new. 

Meanwhile,  the  Germans  had,  more  by  fortune  than  by  foresight,  devel- 
oped a cryptanalytic  service  of  their  own.  Ludwig  Deubner,  a professor  of 
philology  at  the  University  of  Konigsberg  who  had  enlisted  in  the  Landsturm 
as  an  interpreter  of  Russian  and  who  was  stationed  at  the  Konigsberg  for- 
tress, began  his  radio-intelligence  work  by  translating  the  cleartext  intercepts 
that  the  fortress  radio  station  picked  up.  As  words  in  cipher  began  to  appear, 
he  undertook  to  solve  them.  Gradually  he  mastered  the  Russian  system  so 
that  he  could  read  messages  entirely  in  cipher.  At  the  end  of  September,  he 
was  called  to  headquarters  and  given  charge  of  a group  of  interpreters  who 
were  to  learn  cryptanalysis.  Soon  he  and  an  outstanding  colleague — Hoffmann 
called  them  “quite  geniuses  in  deciphering” — were,  with  their  neophyte  code- 
breakers, sending  a stream  of  solutions  to  Ludendorff  each  night  about  11. 
The  chief  of  staff  waited  for  them  impatiently,  barking,  “Any  radiograms?” 
at  his  subordinates.  He  based  his  orders  for  the  next  day  in  large  measure  on 
the  intelligence  the  intercepts  gave.  When  they  were  late,  he  would  stalk  into 
the  cryptanalytic  section  to  find  out  what  the  delay  was.  And  if  for  a time 
nothing  of  importance  appeared  in  the  messages,  he  would  growl  that  the 
intercept  service  had  not  been  paying  attention. 

Such  occasions  were  rare.  Direct  telegraph  connections  were  soon  estab- 
lished between  Pokorny’s  group  and  Deubner’s;  together  they  laid  open  vir- 
tually every  Russian  cryptogram  that  their  posts  intercepted.  And  they  were 
guaranteed  a good  harvest  when  the  headquarters  of  a Russian  army  was 
given  permission  to  use  radio  for  its  front-line  activities  because  its  linemen 
were  busy  with  repair  work. 

Thus  it  was  that  the  Central  Powers  learned  from  Russian  wireless  that  the 
Grand  Duke  Nicholas  was  forming  a huge  phalanx  of  seven  armies  to  rumble 
into  the  industrialized  heart  of  Silesia  in  east-central  Europe.  By  the  end  of 
October,  the  picture  of  the  composition,  disposition,  and  strength  of  the

THE  codebreake;rs 

Russian  forces  that  Hindenburg  and  Ludendorff  had  before  them  could  not 
have  differed  much  from  the  official  one  at  Stavka.  Only  the  date  of  the 
advance  was  unknown,  but  the  Germans  assumed  that  it  would  take  a little 
time  before  this  ponderous  Russian  steamroller  could  get  up  momentum.  They 
determined  to  seize  the  initiative  and  attack  first  in  the  hope  of  throwing  a 
monkey  wrench  into  the  steamroller’s  mechanism. 

Ludendorff’s  plan  was  characteristically  bold.  He  removed  a German 
army  from  the  defenses  blocking  the  invader  and  poised  it  in  the  north  for  a 
plunge  downwards  into  the  right  side  of  the  Russian  wedge.  On  November  1 1, 
the  point  of  this  dagger — an  army  under  Mackensen — began  to  pierce  the 
Russian  flank.  At  2: 10  p.m.  the  next  day,  the  chief  of  staff  of  one  of  the 
Russian  armies  under  attack  transmitted  a long  radiogram  which  the  Central 
Powers  intercepted.  In  addition  to  mentioning  the  date  of  the  projected  Rus- 
sian advance,  it  specified  the  line  of  demarcation  between  his  army  and  a 
neighbor — always  a zone  of  weakness.  This  message  lay,  cryptanalyzed  and 
translated,  on  the  desks  of  the  German  headquarters  for  the  Eastern  Front  at 
Posen  by  the  next  afternoon.  , 

It  was  immediately  forwarded  to  Mackensen.  At  7:30  p.m.,  with  this 
picture  of  the  Russian  dispositions  before  him,  he  telephoned  his  order  for 
the  next  day  to  his  subordinates.  It  called  for  an  all-out  attack,  concentrating 
on  the  meeting  line  of  the  two  armies  in  the  hope  of  driving  them  apart  and 
breaking  through. 

He  achieved  a massive  success.  The  Russian  forces  were  split;  they  pulled 
back  hastily  to  the  south.  Mackensen  shoved  the  dagger  in  up  to  the  hilt.  At 
the  same  time,  Ludendorff  pinned  the  front  Russian  armies  in  combat  and 
sent  a corps  to  turn  the  Russian  left  flank.  He  hoped  to  effect  another  Tannen- 
berg — a double  envelopment.  In  sharp  fighting  around  Lodz,  the  German 
forces  drove  their  enemy  back,  abetted  by  a constant  stream  of  cryptanalyzed 
intelligence.  On  November  15,  for  example,  the  German  command  learned 
that  four  corps  were  to  reinforce  Russian  troops  at  the  Ner  and  Bzura  rivers 
and  that  another  corps  was  to  cross  to  the  left  bank  of  the  Vistula  at  Plozk. 
These  details  enabled  the  Germans  to  maneuver  each  day  as  if  in  a war  game. 

By  now  the  Russians  were  changing  the  key  to  the  order  of  the  cipher 
alphabets — not  the  alphabets  themselves — each  day.  The  cryptanalysts  kept 
pace.  On  November  18,  it  appeared  that  the  Germans  had  won  their  victory 
when  the  cryptanalysts  solved  a message  ordering  a Russian  retreat  from 
Lodz.  But  the  rejoicing  at  headquarters  was  cut  short  when  the  codebreakers 
read  a message  from  Grand  Duke  Nicholas  countermanding  the  order  and 
directing  his  forces  to  fight  on  despite  their  difficult  position.  The  flow  of  radio 
intelligence  continued  unabated,  and  on  the  19th  Mackensen  even  delayed 
giving  an  order  until  intercepted  information  was  received. 

The  next  day  a premonitory  fear  chilled  the  intercept  services  when  they 
picked  up  a message  from  a liaison  officer  of  the  Russian  4th  Army  to  a col- 
league, warning  that  the  Germans  had  the  Russian  cipher  key.  The  Russians 


PyccKan  Kpunmo  aozun  631 

had  captured  a German  cipher  key,  and  they  apparently  assumed  that  one  of 
theirs  had  likewise  fallen  into  German  hands.  A new  key  was  instituted — and 
this  time  the  entire  set  of  cipher  equivalents  was  changed.  A curtain  of  silence 
descended  upon  the  Eastern  Front. 

Feverishly,  Deubner  and  Pokorny,  who  was  assisted  by  Lieutenant  Colonel 
Heinrich  Zemanek  and  Lieutenant  Viktor  von  Marchesetti,  grappled  with  the 
new  key  as  the  intercept  posts  sucked  in  every  scrap  of  Russian  wireless.  The 
moment  could  not  have  been  worse.  The  battle  around  Lodz  raged  at  its  peak, 
and  just  as  Ludendorff  was  about  to  consummate  his  envelopment  with  his 
inferior  forces  but  his  superior  intelligence,  that  intelligence  was  abruptly 
blanked  out.  Deprived  of  his  eyes  and  ears,  he  did  not  know  of  the  Russian 
reinforcements  that  began  to  cut  off  the  deeply  sunk  point  of  Mackensen’s 
dagger.  By  the  21st,  the  point  had  been  isolated,  and  the  envelopers  were  them- 
selves enveloped.  A guards  division  and  two  cavalry  corps  were  encircled  by 
Russian  forces  with  no  apparent  hope  of  escaping.  The  Russians  exultantly 
ordered  up  trains  to  carry  off  the  prisoners. 

But  the  next  day,  Pokorny’s  group  finally  subdued  the  new  Russian 
alphabets,  and  the  intelligence  once  again  began  streaming  into  German 
headquarters.  Intercepts  soon  revealed  a weak  spot  at  Brzeziny  in  the  ring  of 
Russians.  Ludendorff’s  headquarters  radioed  this  information  to  the  trapped 
commanders,  who,  grouping  their  forces  densely  and  fighting  hard,  broke 
out  on  the  25th  and  reached  safety,  bringing  with  them  10,000  prisoners. 
General  Lietzmann,  commander  of  the  guards  division,  won  the  title  “Lion  of 
Brzeziny”  for  the  brilliant  escape;  the  cryptanalysts  who  had  showed  him  how 
best  to  use  his  fangs  and  claws  purred  with  amusement  in  their  secret  lairs. 

This  harrowing  episode,  resulting  from  a fortuitous  change  of  key, 
balked  the  Germans  of  a decisive  victory,  but  they  had  succeeded  in  throwing 
the  vaunted  Russian  steamroller  out  of  gear.  Never  again  did  it  threaten 
German  soil.  The  Central  Powers  pressed  forward,  still  reading  Russian  crypto- 
grams, and  on  December  6 the  soldiers  of  the  Czar  evacuated  Lodz,  the  second 
city  and  the  industrial  capital  of  Poland.  Eight  days  later  they  again  made  a 
wholesale  change  of  alphabets  in  their  digit  cipher.  Solution  again  required 
several  days,  and  when  it  was  completed  the  Austro-German  command 
learned  that  the  Russians  planned  to  dig  in  for  the  winter  along  the  Nida 
River.  Soon  thereafter  they  gave  up  the  old  cipher  altogether. 

When  activity  quickened  in  the  spring  of  1915,  the  Russians  were  using  a 
simple  Caesar  cipher.*  The  multiplicity  of  tables  used  by  different  armies  in 
the  old  cipher,  the  daily  shift  of  keys,  had  evidently  proved  too  difficult  to 
handle  for  the  half-illiterate  muzhiks.  The  Austrian  and  German  crypt- 
analytic  organizations  saw  right  through  this  transparent  new  cipher  and 

* During  the  Second  Battle  of  the  Masurian  Lakes  in  February,  in  which  the  Russians 
were  defeated,  they  used  a service  code  called  the  rsk,  which  the  Germans  solved.  Its 
nature  is  unknown.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


read  the  indications  of  a projected  Russian  invasion  of  East  and  West  Prussia. 
Then  began  what  Colonel  Max  Ronge,  head  of  Austro-Hungarian  intelligence, 
called  “the  most  brilliant  period  of  our  interception  services.”  Enormous 
quantities  of  intelligence  were  sluiced  from  the  Pokorny  and  Deubner  groups 
into  the  offices  of  the  operations  staffs  of  the  German  and  Austro-Hungarian 
commands.  Helped  by  this,  they  parried  the  first  tentative  Russian  advances, 
and  then  themselves  swept  through  the  whole  enemy  line  in  a rapid  on- 
slaught that  penetrated  80  miles  in  two  weeks. 

Time  after  time,  their  solutions  enabled  the  Central  Powers  to  take  steps 
which  were  so  perfectly  the  right  thing  to  do  in  each  tactical  situation  that  the 
Russian  general  staff  was  mystified  by  its  opponents’  apparent  clairvoyance. 
Once  the  Germans  fell  back  just  two  days  before  an  overwhelming  assault  was 
to  be  launched;  had  they  remained  in  place,  their  position  would  quickly  have 
become  critical.  After  the  Germans  captured  Lodz,  the  Russians  pondered  the 
precision  of  the  enemy  moves  and  decided  that  the  Germans  must  have  ob- 
tained intelligence  from  air  reconnaissance. 

Eventually,  however,  the  conviction  grew  that  the  foe  must  be  reading  their 
ciphers.  They  did  not  suspect  cryptanalysis.  Spies,  they  thought,  must  have 
sold  them  to  the  Austrians,  and  in  a wave  of  spy-mania  they  persecuted  officers 
with  German  names — none  of  whom,  Ronge  said,  had  ever  given  anything  to 
him.  The  Russians  changed  their  cipher  at  the  height  of  the  enemy’s  spring 
offensive,  but  this  caused  the  cipher  clerks  more  trouble  than  it  did  the  crypt- 
analysts, for  almost  all  messages  of  May  15  were  unintelligible  to  their 
recipients  and  most  of  those  of  the  16th  as  well. 

The  summer-long  Russian  retreat  finally  came  to  a halt  at  the  end  of 
September  on  a defensible  position  deep  within  their  own  territory.  By  then 
Russia  had  lost  750,000  men  as  prisoners  and  untold  hundreds  of  thousands 
more  as  casualties.  She  simply  threw  more  men  into  the  war.  She  seemed  to 
adhere  to  the  same  policy  in  cryptography — and  with  the  same  lack  of  suc- 
cess. On  December  20,  1915,  she  put  her  13th  cipher  into  operation.  The 
Austrian  and  German  cryptanalysts  recognized  it  at  once  as  having  been  used 
elsewhere  on  the  front,  and  during  the  inconclusive  battles  before  and  after 
New  Year’s  Day  kept  up  with  the  enemy  situation  hour  by  hour.  On  June  16, 
1916,  the  Russians  began  using  their  first  code,  a small  one  of  about  300 
groups.  This  development  may  have  been  influenced  by  the  French,  who  had 
learned  about  the  German  solution  of  Russian  messages  from  their  own 
cryptanalyses  and  had  passed  the  news  to  their  allies.  Or  it  may  have  resulted 
from  Russia’s  own  intercept  service;  just  how  well  Russia  did  in  military 
cryptanalysis  is  not  known,  but  she  did  set  up  direction-finding  stations  in 
mid-1916  and  started  an  intercept  school  at  Nicolaieff. 

The  travail  of  the  Central  Powers  cryptanalysts,  who  were  unused  to  code, 
was  simplified  when  some  Russian  commands,  who  were  equally  unfamiliar 
with  it,  continued  using  the  old  system.  And  their  work  was  made  almost 
mechanical  when  the  headquarters  of  a Russian  guard  detachment  that  was 


PyccKan  KpunmoAozun  633 

being  joined  to  the  8th  Army  compromised  the  new  system  by  a message  in 
clear.  A great  hubbub  arose  in  the  8th  Army;  a new  code  was  instituted;  this 
one  cryptanalysts  solved  without  much  trouble.  By  then  they  were  reading  up 
to  70  Russian  dispatches  a day.  The  German  solutions  seem  to  have  been 
made  in  the  radio  stations  of  the  various  fortresses,  to  which  Deubner 
communicated  the  keys  as  he  solved  them.  Some  of  the  Austrian  cryptanalysis 
was  done  at  Ronge’s  Austro-Nord  Penkala  under  the  command  of  Captain 
Karl  Boldeskul.  Later  in  the  war,  when  Pokorny  was  promoted  to  head  of 
the  whole  Kriegschiffregruppe,  the  Russian  subsection  of  the  Dechiffrier- 
dienst  at  headquarters  was  taken  over  by  von  Marchesetti;  in  1918  Rudolf 
Lippmann  succeeded  him. 

On  November  6,  1916,  the  Russian  Army  of  the  Danube  suppressed  the 
radio  use  of  cipher  No.  14  as  known  to  the  enemy,  and  on  December  17 
another  cipher  was  called  out  of  service  because  the  radio  station  of  the  1st 
Cossack  Division  had  been  captured.  Four  days  later  they  returned  to  the  air 
with  a code  that  proved  to  be  merely  a slightly  shifted  version  of  one  that  had 
been  instituted  a week  earlier.  All  these  changes  the  cryptanalysts  followed 
with  contemptuous  ease.  The  increasing  disorganization  of  the  Russian  armies 
contaminated  the  radio  services,  and  as  discipline  relaxed,  garrulity  increased. 
One  day  early  in  1917,  the  Dechiffrierdienst  solved  333  radiograms,  from 
which  it  inferred  that  the  Russian  secret  communications  were  rapidly  disin- 
tegrating. In  March  the  Czar  was  overthrown,  in  July  an  all-out  offensive  by 
the  Russian  armies  collapsed,  and  in  October  the  Bolsheviks,  using  the 
people’s  overwhelming  desire  for  peace,  seized  power  and  took  Russia  out  of 
the  war. 

The  way  to  this  situation  was  opened  primarily  by  Russia’s  military 
failure.  While  this  resulted  largely  from  the  lack  of  munitions,  food,  and  sup- 
plies that  the  underindustrialized  country  could  not  supply,  the  tactical  defeats 
inflicted  by  the  Central  Powers  obviously  played  a conclusive  role.  And 
these  victories  of  a David  over  a Goliath,  though  aided  by  superior  German 
equipment,  discipline,  and  logistics,  were  mainly  engendered  by  cryptanalysis. 

“We  were  always  warned  by  the  wireless  messages  of  the  Russian  staff  of 
the  positions  where  troops  were  being  concentrated  for  any  new  undertaking,’ 
wrote  Hoffmann.  So  complete  was  the  intelligence  that  he  could  say:  “Only 
once  during  the  whole  war  were  we  taken  by  surprise  on  the  Eastern  Front  by 
a Russian  attack — it  was  on  the  Aa  in  the  winter  of  1916-17.’  This  dramatic- 
ally underlines  the  importance  of  cryptanalysis  in  the  outcome  of  the  war  in 
the  East  and  in  all  that  that  entailed.  Indeed,  it  may  not  be  too  much  to  claim 
that  the  establishment  of  Communist  power,  perhaps  the  supreme  fact  of 
contemporary  history,  was  made  possible  to  a significant  degree  by  the 
cryptanalysis  of  czarist  secret  communications. 

The  consolidation  of  the  Soviet  regime  permitted  Lenin  and  his  colleagues 
to  turn  not  only  to  the  difficult  problems  of  running  the  world's  first  socialist

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


state  but  also  to  the  traditional  Communist  activity  of  fomenting  class  struggle 
and  the  revolution  of  the  proletariat.  They  felt  justified  in  using  subversion  as 
well  as  the  more  orthodox  methods  of  propaganda  and  political  agitation  in 
advancing  Marxism  in  countries  that  had  not  yet  reached  Russia’s  stage  of 
historical  development. 

Some  of  their  agents  were  mere  mercenaries,  some  were  Russians  planted 
as  spies,  but  many  were  native  members  of  Communist  parties  who  placed 
their  quasi-religious  dedication  to  that  ideology  above  allegiance  to  country. 
These  spies  were  soon  sending  quantities  of  information  to,  and  receiving 
instructions  from,  Moscow,  whence  the  impetus  and  control  for  the  world 
revolution  would  come.  In  doing  so  during  these  early  years  before  Com- 
munist espionage  had  stabilized  itself  they  employed  a wide  variety  of  cipher 
systems. 

In  1919,  German  Communists  employed  an  irregular  columnar  trans- 
position. One  key  was  the  second  line  of  Heinrich  Heine’s  “Die  Lorelei 
DASS  ICH  SO  TRAURIG  BIN:  another  was  ACH,  WENN  DAS  DER 
PETRUS  WUSSTE  (Oh,  if  Peter  only  knew  it).  Three  messages  so  enciphered 
were  discovered  in  an  airplane  en  route  to  the  Soviet  Union  from  Germany 
that  was  forced  down  in  Latvia.  The  Latvian  government,  after  failing  to 
solve  them,  had  turned  them  over  to  the  American  consul  at  Riga  for  help, 
and  from  him  they  eventually  found  their  way  to  Yardley’s  Black  Chamber, 
where  they  were  quickly  solved.  They  began  with  a plea  to  Sendet  geld  {“ Send 
money”),  discussed  the  fiasco  of  a Communist  conference  in  Holland, 
reported  the  arrest  of  the  fiery  German  Communist  Klara  Zetkin,  pleaded 
that  “[Karl]  Radek  or  [Nikolai]  Bukharin  [both  intimates  of  Lenin]  is 
absolutely  needed  here,”  disclosed  that  “Radio  station  finally  ready  to  send. 
Expert  engaged . . . Guralski  arrived  here  with  money  on  his  way  to  America,” 
and  cautioned  that  “My  name  is  now  james.”  The  solutions  caused  a stir  in 
Washington,  for  they  were  among  the  first  authentic  documents  dealing  with 
Soviet  international  activities  that  came  into  the  American  government’s 
hands. 

At  about  the  same  time,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  began  what  must 
have  been  one  of  its  first  infiltrations  into  the  Communist  party,  U.S. A. 
Undercover  agent  Francis  A.  Morrow  of  Camden,  New  Jersey,  sent  a steady 
stream  of  reports  to  the  department  while  rising  in  the  party  to  become 
secretary  of  a district  committee.  He  got  on  close  terms  with  the  district 
organizer,  and  one  day  the  latter,  when  a little  tipsy,  let  Morrow  help  him  in 
deciphering  a message.  The  cipher  that  Morrow  thus  reported  to  the  Justice 
Department  was  used  by  the  party’s  leadership  to  communicate  with  its 
organizers.  It  was  based  upon  a United  States  postal  money  order,  possession 
of  which  would  not  incriminate  anyone.  Its  ciphertext  appeared  as  a series  of 
arithmetical  fractions,  whose  numerator  represented  the  line  of  type  on  the 
back  of  the  money  order  blank,  and  the  denominator  the  letter  in  that  line. 
The  system  recalls  the  fractional  one  used  by  the  Russian  revolutionaries  in 


PyccKan  KpunmoAozun  635 

czarist  days,  and  was,  in  fact,  probably  taken  over  from  that  time,  as  were 
many  Communist  underground  practices.  For  example,  the  use  of  the  term 
“dubok,”  which  literally  means  “little  oak,”  to  mean  a hiding  place  for  mes- 
sages, and  of  “illness”  to  mean  an  arrest,  originated  before  the  Revolution. 

This  simple  system  vanished  with  the  advent  of  a more  highly  organized 
Soviet  intelligence  apparatus.  Russia’s  Amtorg  Trading  Corporation,  which 
set  up  offices  in  New  York  in  1924,  controlled  the  first  real  Soviet  espionage 
effort  against  the  United  States.  Communications  with  the  Soviet  Union 
were  naturally  carried  on  in  code,  and,  whatever  system  was  used,  it  effectively 
protected  the  secrets  of  their  American  spies.  Representative  Hamilton  Fish, 
Jr.,  of  New  York,  chairman  of  a committee  investigating  Communist  activi- 
ties in  the  United  States,  subpoenaed  3,000  coded  Amtorg  telegrams  in  1930 
in  the  hope  of  learning  more  about  those  activities.  The  cryptanalysts  of  the 
Navy’s  Code  and  Signal  Section,  to  which  he  had  submitted  the  cryptograms, 
reported  that  “the  cipher  used  by  the  Amtorg  is  the  most  complicated  and 
possesses  the  greatest  secrecy  within  their  [the  Navy  cryptanalysts’]  know- 
ledge.” Fish  then  gave  the  cablegrams  to  the  War  Department  for  solution; 
two  years  later,  he  complained  on  the  floor  of  Congress,  “Not  one  expert — 
and  they  had  from  six  months  to  a year — succeeded  in  decoding  a single 
word  of  those  cablegrams,  although  they  had  assured  me  they  could  decode 
them.” 

In  Copenhagen  in  1934,  a cipher  disk  with  seven  rings  of  digits  around  a 
mixed  plaintext  alphabet  guarded  the  messages  of  the  Danish  Communist 
party.  This  key  was  captured  in  a police  raid,  however,  after  which  the  mes- 
sages yielded  rather  easily  to  the  cryptanalytic  ministrations  of  Yves  Gylden, 
who  was  summoned  from  Stockholm. 

It  was  during  the  Spanish  Civil  War,  in  which  Russia  actively  aided  the 
Loyalists,  that  a cryptographic  element  that  had  served  the  revolutionary 
predecessors  of  Lenin  & Co.  reappeared  in  a form  both  streamlined  and  more 
secure.  This  was  the  straddling  checkerboard.  Its  straddling  feature  makes  use 
of  cipher  equivalents  of  two  different  lengths — lengths  usually  of  one  digit 
and  two  digits;  the  two  sets  of  equivalents  are  so  constructed  that  the  crypto- 
grapher can  unambiguously  separate  them  when  they  are  run  together.  The 
cryptanalyst,  however,  not  knowing  which  digits  are  singletons  and  which 
form  pairs,  may  divide  the  ciphertext  incorrectly,  thereby  “straddling”  many 
of  the  true  pairs  and  combining  two  singletons  into  a false  pair.  The  device 
also  reduces  the  length  of  the  numerical  text  as  compared  with  checkerboards 
in  which  all  letters  are  replaced  by  numerical  pairs.  Straddling  was  first 
employed  by  the  Argentis  in  some  of  their  16th-century  papal  ciphers 
(one  wonders  whether  the  atheistic  Communists  knew!). 

The  straddling  checkerboard  produces  single-digit  equivalents  by  leaving 
the  side  coordinate  off  one  of  the  rows  of  the  checkerboard.  A letter  in  this 
row  is  enciphered  by  just  the  single  coordinate  above  it.  If  ambiguity  is  to  be 
avoided,  none  of  these  singletons  can  start  a two-digit  group.  Hence  none  can 


636 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


be  used  as  a side  coordinate  (which  is  read  first).  Using  eight  digits  of  the  ten 
as  singletons  leaves  two  digits  as  side  coordinates;  each  of  these  two  side 
coordinates  can  then  pair  with  the  ten  top  coordinates  (the  singletons  may 
serve  in  second  position)  to  produce  20  two-digit  groups.  This  configuration 
makes  28  ciphertext  equivalents  available  for  plaintext  elements. 

It  was  used  in  1937  with  keyword  M DEL  VAYO,  the  M the  initial  of  the 
agent,  the  DEL  VAYO  the  name  of  a Spanish  Communist.  The  two  extra 
spaces  were  used  for  a period  and  a letter-number  shift  sign: 

0987654321 


1 

2 


m d 
b c 

q r 


el  v a y o 

fghuj  knp 
s t u w x z . / 


With  this,  e = 8,  a = 5,  b = 10,  t = 27,  and  so  on.  There  will  be  no  single 
2 or  1.  The  decipherer  takes  all  l’s  and  2’s  as  the  first  digits  of  a two-digit 
group,  and  joins  to  it  whatever  digit  follows.  He  takes  any  digits  from  3 to  0 
as  individuals  if  they  are  not  already  part  of  a pair.  Thus  the  ciphertext 
828115125  can  be  unambiguously  divided  as  8 28  11  5 12  5 and  deciphered 
to  E span  a. 

Other  configurations  are  possible.  Seven  single  digits  will  permit  three 
side  coordinates,  for  a total  of  37  cells  in  the  checkerboard.  Six  singletons  will 
produce  46  cells;  five,  55,  and  so  on  down  to  one  singleton,  91  cells.  The 
arrangement  with  28  equivalents  has  been  widely  used  for  Latin-alphabet 
texts,  that  with  37  for  Cyrillic  texts. 

Although  the  M DEL  VAYO  checkerboard  was  used  by  the  Swedish 
fellow  traveler  Dr.  Per  Meurling  only  to  teach  his  fiancee  secret  writing,  his 
knowledge  of  it  testifies  to  its  use  at  that  time  by  the  Communists.  He  sub- 
jected the  numerical  text  resulting  from  the  checkerboard  to  a multiplication, 
and  then  reconverted  the  product  to  letters  in  another  checkerboard.  The 
system  resembled  but  was  much  weaker  than  Pliny  Earle  Chase’s  of  1859, 
and  it  is  unlikely  that  the  Russians  would  have  used  it  in  that  form. 

The  Spanish  Civil  War,  a prelude  to  World  War  II,  furnished  the  Fascist- 
Nazi  and  the  Communist  dictatorships  with  a testing  ground  for  the  weapons 
they  would  use  in  the  later  conflict.  Perhaps  this  extended — for  the  Commun- 
ists, at  least — to  the  cryptologic  arena  as  well.  Red  ciphers  of  World  War  II 
had  purged  themselves  of  whatever  weaknesses  were  discovered  in  Spain  and 
had  erected  upon  their  strengths  an  impregnable  structure. 


The  Soviet  Union  was  not  so  totally  immersed  in  the  task  of  improving  its 
own  ciphers  that  it  could  not  heed  what  other  nations  were  doing  to  theirs.  On 
the  contrary,  it  engaged  in  the  constant  tug-of-war  of  “practical  cryptanalysis.” 
This  is  more  prosaically  known  as  stealing  codes.  It  is  speedier  and  easier  on

the  cryptanalysts’  brains  than  pure  analytical  cryptanalysis,  or  solving,  but  it 
costs  more  and  risks  loss  of  the  information  if  the  theft  is  discovered. 

Victories  in  this  tug-of-war  went  now  to  one  side,  now  to  the  other.  In 
1926,  a French  Communist  was  arrested  in  Marseilles  with  the  French  Army 
code  afno  in  her  possession.  Both  it  and  an  Interior  Ministry  code  had  been 
smuggled  out  of  the  prison  at  Melun,  where  French  codes  were  printed,  by  a 
convict  named  Bultez,  who  concealed  them  in  the  pages  of  an  English  gram- 
mar on  his  release.  The  following  year,  Russia  recruited  the  cipher  expert 
of  the  Persian  Council  of  Ministers,  who  promptly  became  Agent  No.  33. 
Also  serving  the  Communist  cause  was  the  cipher  clerk  of  a Persian  Army 
brigade  near  the  Russian  border.  Somehow  the  Soviet  espionage  organiza- 
tion, the  O.G.P.U.,  had  obtained  the  cipher  key  of  the  Dachnaks,  an  anti- 
Communist  party  in  Soviet  Armenia.  Dachnak  activity  was  directed  from 
Tabriz,  across  the  border  in  Persia.  The  O.G.P.U.  resident  in  Tabriz  made 
certain  arrangements  with  a Persian  postal  official,  and  soon  the  O.G.P.U. 
knew  enough  to  block  any  Dachnak  move,  if  necessary,  with  a swift  series  of 
arrests  and  raids.  In  1930,  a Rumanian  police  official  expressed  his  displeasure 
over  a demotion  by  presenting  his  country’s  secret  code  to  the  Soviets. 

The  shoe  was  on  the  other  foot  in  1925,  when  code  documents  disappeared 
from  the  Soviet  embassy  in  Shanghai.  The  White  Russian  suspected  of  the 
theft  disappeared  overboard  on  his  way  to  Vladivostok.  Ten  years  later,  a 
Soviet  employee  stole  codes  from  his  embassy  in  Prague;  their  subsequent 
recovery  and  courteous  return  by  Czech  police  could  hardly  have  convinced 
the  Russians  that  they  had  not  been  compromised. 

In  the  summer  of  1936,  Russian  military  intelligence  gained  access  to  the 
coded  correspondence  of  the  Japanese  military  attache  in  Berlin  with  his  home 
office  in  Tokyo.  Photostats  of  the  telegrams  were  rushed  to  Haarlem,  where  a 
Japanese-language  expert  from  Moscow  decoded  them — with  a Japanese 
codebook  that  the  Russians  had  obtained— and  then  translated  them.  They 
proved  to  be  messages  relating  to  the  Anti-Comintern  Pact,  which  was  of  the 
greatest  interest  to  the  homeland  of  the  Third  Communist  International.  In 
1937,  the  Russians  were  on  the  losing  end  again,  when  the  code  employed 
between  Moscow  and  the  Spanish  Loyalist  Ministry  of  National  Defense, 
which  was  receiving  help  from  Russia  in  the  struggle  against  Franco,  was 
reported  stolen.  The  Russians  again  lost  in  1938,  when  General  G.  S.  Lyush- 
kov,  a secret  police  official  in  the  Soviet  Far  East  Army,  defected  to  Japan  and 
revealed  details  of  his  army’s  secret  communications— though  Soviet  agents 
mitigated  the  damage  by  telling  Moscow  what  he  was  telling  the  Japanese.  A 
victory  ended  the  following  year,  when  another  defector  disclosed  the  presence 
of  a Soviet  spy,  Captain  John  Herbert  King,  in  the  code  room  of  the  British 
Foreign  Office.  England  sentenced  him  to  ten  years. 

All  this  thievery  back  and  forth  reached  a ludicrous  climax  of  sorts  in  a 
1939  lawsuit.  Two  Russian  emigres,  Vladimir  and  Maria  Azarov,  had  boot- 
legged out  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1939  a “certain  Code  Book  containing  the

code  for  the  transmission  of  messages,  then  in  use  by  the  Union  of  Socialist 
Soviet  Republics,  which  Code  Book  was  of  a secret  nature.”  The  Cunard 
steamship  line  had  shipped  their  goods,  the  codebook  included,  aboard  the 
freighter  Baltabor,  which  had  grounded  in  the  harbor  of  Riga,  resulting  in  the 
loss  of  all  the  Azarovs’  property.  Whereupon  they  sued  the  steamship  com- 
pany for  $511,900 — $11,900  for  clothes  and  house  furnishings  and  half  a 
million  for  the  code,  a figure  which  Azarov  said  represented  the  “value  of  the 
Code  Book  in  the  open  market  at  the  time  of  its  loss.”  The  matter  was  settled 
out  of  court,  and  how  much  cash  the  Azarovs  finally  accepted  for  this 
almost-impossible-to-price  article  has  never  been  revealed. 

Soviet  cryptologic  espionage  extended  beyond  the  simple  theft  of  codes. 
It  included,  apparently,  lifting  plaintexts  that  might  help  Soviet  cryptanalysts 
solve  codes  or  ciphers.  In  this  category  fall  the  famous  “pumpkin  papers,” 
which  ex-Communist  Whittaker  Chambers  accused  Alger  Hiss  of  giving  to 
him  for  transmission  to  Soviet  agents.  Though  Chambers  never  gave  the 
particular  rolls  of  film  that  constituted  the  actual  “pumpkin  papers”  to  the 
Russian  Colonel  Boris  Bykov,  they  were  representative  of  many  other, 
similar  photographed  documents,  allegedly  from  Hiss,  that  he  did  pass  on. 
They  included,  for  example,  a cablegram  from  the  American  embassy  in 
Paris  of  January  13,  1938,  marked  “Strictly  Confidential,  for  the  Secretary.” 
Though  parts  of  some  of  these  messages  were  sent  in  the  nonconfidential 
gray  code,  others,  stated  Sumner  Welles,  who  was  Under  Secretary  of  State 
in  1938,  “would  presumably  be  sent  in  one  of  the  most  secret  codes  then  in 
our  possession.”  When  he  was  asked,  “Would  the  possession  of  the  document 
as  translated,  along  with  the  original  document  as  it  appeared  in  code,  furnish 
an  individual  with  the  necessary  information  to  break  the  code?”  he  replied: 
“In  my  opinion,  decidedly  yes.”  And  at  least  one  Russian  expert  (Isaac  Don 
Levine,  the  Russian-born  journalist  who  specialized  in  Soviet  affairs)  became 
convinced  by  mid- 1939  from  numerous  conversations  he  had  with  General 
Walter  Krivitsky,  the  defected  head  of  Soviet  military  intelligence  for 
Western  Europe,  that  the  Communist  cryptanalysts  were  reading  American 
codes. 

Questions  of  the  security  of  Soviet  communications  naturally  interested 
their  secret  agents.  One  day  during  World  War  II,  Lauchlin  Currie,  an  assis- 
tant to  President  Roosevelt  and  allegedly  an  informer  for  Russia,  reportedly 
burst  into  the  house  of  George  Silverman,  a member  of  a Soviet  spy  ring,  and 
told  him  that  the  United  States  was  about  to  break  a Soviet  code.  When 
Communist  courier  Elizabeth  T.  Bentley  passed  this  news  on,  her  Russian 
superior  asked,  “Which  code?”  Miss  Bentley  was  unable  to  find  out.  (Currie 
has  denied  ever  making  such  a statement  to  anyone,  saying  that  he  knew 
nothing  about  any  American  cryptanalytic  attempts  or  successes,  and  that 
he  was  not  a Soviet  agent.) 

Soviet  espionage,  finally,  did  not  disdain  the  least  tidbit  of  information 
that  might  be  of  help  to  its  cryptanalysts.  In  the  winter  of  1945,  when  agents 


PyccKan  KpunmoAozun  639 

of  the  O.S.S.  broke  into  the  New  York  office  of  a Communist-linked 
magazine  called  Amerasia,  they  found  therein,  among  approximately  1,800 
confidential  U.S.  official  documents,  a top-secret  report  revealing  the 
American  breakdown  and  mastery  of  Japanese  codes. 

The  Soviet  Union  expressed  its  intense  interest  in  the  codes  and  ciphers  of 
other  countries  primarily  through  the  clandestine  activities  of  two  agencies — 
the  secret  police  and  military  intelligence. 

The  secret  police,  through  which  the  Communist  government  enthralls  the 
people  of  Russia,  is  more  than  just  a Gestapo.  It  gathers  external  intelligence 
as  well  as  guarding  internal  security.  It  thus  encompasses  the  functions  of  a 
C.I.A.  as  well  as  an  F.B.I.  This  seemingly  unusual  situation  began  under  the 
czars,  when  revolutionary  agents  were  very  numerous  outside  Russia.  The 
Okhrana  infiltrated  their  conspiracies  outside  Russia,  and  its  successor  under 
Communism  did  the  same  to  the  exiles  who  sought  to  undermine  Soviet 
power.  Soon  it  extended  these  activities  to  capitalistic  Western  countries  as  a 
means  of  defending  the  Marxist  regime,  and  in  this  way  it  developed  into  a 
political  intelligence  service.  Created  by  Lenin  only  a month  after  he  founded 
his  government,  the  secret  police  has  had  an  extremely  tangled  history.  Its 
various  reorganizations,  mergers,  and  separations  are  reflected  in  its  various 
names — Cheka,  G.P.U.,  O.G.P.U.,  N.K.V.D.,  M.G.B.,  M.V.D.,  and  K.G.B. 
After  Stalin,  it  was  divided  into  two  agencies,  the  K.G.B.  or  Komitet  Gosur- 
darstvennoi  Bezopasnosti  (“Committee  for  State  Security”),  responsible  for 
external  espionage  and  high-level  internal  counterespionage,  and  the  M.V.D., 
or  Ministerstvo  Vnutrennykh  Del  (“Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs”),  for  the 
more  routine  domestic  policing  functions. 

The  other  Soviet  intelligence  agency  is  an  arm  of  the  Red  armed  forces, 
rather  corresponding  to  the  American  Defense  Intelligence  Agency.  Founded 
by  Leon  Trotsky,  the  first  Soviet  Minister  of  War,  it,  like  the  secret  police,  has 
changed  its  name  and  organization  during  Russia’s  administrative  upheavals. 
In  theory,  it  attends  to  military  matters  whereas  the  K.G.B.  handles  political 
espionage,  but  this  line  has  often  been  blurred— perhaps  intentionally.  The  two 
were  even  merged  briefly.  Military  attaches  belong  to  it,  and  contacts  with 
foreign  governments  on  intelligence  matters  are  made  through  it.  Its  present 
title  is  G.R.U.,  for  Glavnoye  Razvedyvatelnoye  Upravlenie  (“Chief  Intelli- 
gence Directorate”). 

One  of  the  tasks  of  the  secret  police  is  to  protect  the  dictatorship  of  the 
proletariat  from  the  proletarians  who  are  unhappy  with  the  dictators.  Soon 
after  Lenin  founded  it,  the  Cheka  resumed  the  czarist  black-cabinet  practices 
of  opening  mail  and  reading  telegrams.  The  practice  has  gone  forward  unin- 
terruptedly, altered  only  by  improvements  in  techniques.  By  the  1950s,  the 
M.V.D.  was  confiding  this  activity  to  an  entire  section— the  3rd,  or  Individual, 
Division  of  the  M.V.D.’s  2nd  Special  Directorate,  the  Directorate  for  Positive 
State  Security.  This  division  ensures  the  reliability  of  the  Soviet  citizenry  by 


640 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  most  modern  methods  of  communications  surveillance,  such  as  electronic 
room-bugging,  as  well  as  by  the  most  pedestrian  methods  of  shadowing, 
using  informers,  and  reading  letters.  Representatives  of  the  secret  police’s 
Information  Administration,  stationed  in  postal-telegraph  stations,  have  long 
opened  foreign  mail,  letters  to  suspected  persons,  and  a percentage  of  the  rest 
of  the  mail  at  random. 

They  turned  over  any  suspicious  letters  to  the  chief  cryptologic  agency  of 
the  Soviet  Union,  the  quasi-independent  Spets-Otdel  (“Special  Department”), 
whose  primary  task  was  reading  the  coded  messages  of  other  nations.  Though 
attached  to  the  foreign  directorate  of  the  secret  police,  it  was  actually  respon- 
sible to  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Russian  Communist  party,  the  Soviet 
Union’s  real  ruling  body,  whose  chairman  was  first  Lenin  and  then  Stalin.  In 
1938,  it  appears  to  have  been  renamed  and  reorganized  into  the  5th  Director- 
ate of  what  was  then  the  N.K.V.D. 

Up  until  that  time,  and  beginning,  apparently,  around  1927,  its  chief  was 
Gleb  I.  Boki,  an  old  Bolshevik  and  friend  of  Lenin,  who,  at  the  same  time, 
sat  on  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  Soviet  Union!  Born  in  1879,  he  had  taken 
part  in  prerevolutionary  activities  and  had  gained  the  Communist  badge  of 
honor  by  being  arrested  many  times  and  winning  a three-year  sentence  in 
Siberia.  At  the  time  of  the  Revolution,  he  was  secretary  of  the  Bolshevik  cell 
in  the  capital,  St.  Petersburg.  In  the  early  1920s,  he  headed  the  Cheka  in 
Turkestan,  where  he  so  terrorized  the  country  that  legends  about  him  re- 
mained alive  long  after  he  had  gone : that  he  ate  dog  meat  (especially  execrable 
to  the  Moslem  population),  even  that  he  drank  human  blood.  It  seems  true, 
however,  that  as  head  of  the  Spets-Otdel  Boki  held  wild  parties,  if  not  actual 
orgies,  with  a group  of  carefully  selected  guests  at  his  rented  dacha  near 
Batumi  during  his  vacations.  He  kept  his  office  door  always  closed  and  used 
a peephole  with  one-way  glass  to  examine  visitors.  Tall  and  stooped,  with  a 
sinister  expression  and  cold  blue  eyes  that  gave  one  the  impression  that  he 
hated  the  very  sight  of  you,  he  gave  at  least  one  girl  worker  the  shivers  when- 
ever he  emerged  from  his  sanctum  and  spoke  to  her  when  she  was  alone  in  the 
office  on  night  duty.  Never  with  a hat  and  always  with  his  raincoat,  which 
he  wore  in  all  seasons,  Boki  seems  to  have  been  an  administrator  rather  than 
a cryptologist.  He  was  executed  in  1938  in  the  great  Stalinist  purges.  After- 
wards, it  was  discovered  that  he  had,  most  unsocialistically,  hoarded  gold  and 
silver  coins. 

The  Spets-Otdel  handled  both  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis.  In  1933, 
the  cryptographers  worked  in  a big  room  on  the  fourth  floor  of  a former 
insurance  building  that  the  O.G.P.U.  occupied  at  6 Lubyanka  Street.  The 
cryptanalysts  were  then  on  the  top  floor  of  a former  Ministry  of  Foreign 
Affairs  building  at  the  corner  of  Lubyanka  Street  and  Kuznetsky  Bridge 
Street.  The  comings  and  goings  of  ordinary  tenants  on  the  lower  floors  and 
of  the  members  of  a diplomats’  club  disguised  the  presence  of  the  office.  In 
1935,  both  cryptographers  and  cryptanalysts  moved  into  the  new  building  of 


PyccKan  Kpunmojiozun  641 

what  was  now  the  N.K.V.D.  at  2 Dzerzhinsky  Street  (named  for  the  first  head 
of  the  secret  police,  Felix  Dzerzhinsky). 

The  cryptographic  division  was  subdivided  into  several  sections.  There 
were  separate  sections,  for  example,  for  the  N.K.V.D.  network  inside  Russia, 
for  the  border  patrols  (under  N.K.V.D.  jurisdiction)  and  uniformed  N.K.V.D 
troops,  for  Gulag,  the  prison  administration,  for  clandestine  agents  abroad, 
and  for  the  “legal”  N.K.V.D.  residents  abroad.  This  last  section  was  No.  6. 
Its  chief,  Koslov,  was  dismissed  during  the  purges,  and  after  his  successor 
was  sent  to  the  United  States  as  a cipher  clerk,  the  section  was  headed  by  a 
man  not  unknown  to  later  fame — Vladimir  M.  Petrov,  who  defected  in  1954 
and  was  granted  asylum  in  Australia.* 

The  growth  of  Section  6 may  measure  that  of  Soviet  espionage.  When 
Petrov  joined  in  1933,  there  were  only  12  workers;  in  1951,  there  were  45 
or  50.  As  cipher  clerks  in  the  N.K.V.D.,  entrusted  with  the  deepest  secrets  of 
the  most  secret  agency  in  Russia,  these  people  were  among  the  elite  of  the 
Soviet  Union,  yet  their  jobs  in  this  workers’  paradise  were  anything  but 
heavenly.  Ciphering  was  done  by  hand,  and  early  in  his  career  Petrov  often 
worked  until  midnight  to  clear  up  the  day’s  backlog  of  telegrams.  Later,  as 
deputy  section  chief,  Petrov  did  no  actual  enciphering  or  deciphering,  but 
read  the  telegrams,  corrected  them,  and  signed  them.  Sometimes  the  clerks 
were  given  noncryptographic  assignments,  as  in  the  case  of  Bokov,  a tall, 
taciturn,  unusually  strong  staff  member.  He  was  selected  to  kill  the  Soviet  am- 
bassador in  a Middle  Eastern  country,  which  he  did  with  a single  blow  of  a 
short  iron  bar  that  split  the  ambassador’s  skull  in  his  office  one  day.  Bokov 
stayed  on  for  a year  as  a cipher  clerk  in  the  embassy  to  throw  off  suspicion, 
and  then  returned — with  the  order  of  the  Red  Star. 

The  cryptanalysts  were  divided  into  geographical  and  linguistic  subsec- 
tions— Chinese,  Anglo-American,  and  so  on.t  The  future  Mrs.  Ekdovia 
Petrov,  who  had  studied  Japanese  for  two  years  at  a language  school  in 
Moscow,  was  assigned  to  the  Japanese  section.  Among  her  co-workers  were 
Vera  Plotnikova,  daughter  of  a professor  of  Japanese  and  a long-time  resident 
of  Japan ; Galina  Podpalova,  who  liked  things  Japanese  so  much  that  she 

* Petrov  named  three  men  who  were  his  bosses  at  different  times  while  he  was  section 
chief— Ilyin,  Degtjarov,  and  Shevelev.  Whether  these  were  the  heads  of  the  entire,  then 
newly  formed  N.K.V.D.  5th  Directorate,  or  whether  they  were  department  heads  (a  pos- 
sible administrative  level  between  the  section  chiefs  and  the  directorate’s  chief),  is  not  known. 
The  former  may  be  more  likely  in  view  of  the  fact  that  Boki’s  successor,  Shapiro,  lasted 
only  a month  or  two  before  he  was  arrested,  and  three  or  four  of  Shapiro’s  successors  were 
also  arrested. 

t In  1933,  it  also  had  a military  intelligence  group,  headed  by  a Colonel  Kharkevich,  a 
solid,  impressive  man  who  reported  to  both  Boki  and  the  general  staff.  This  group  appears 
to  have  later  been  abolished  or  transferred  to  the  Army;  Kharkevich  himself  was  purged  in 
1938.  The  head— under  Boki— of  the  O.G.P.U.  group  of  cryptanalysts  was  one  Gusev, 
possibly  Sergei  I.  Gusev,  an  old  revolutionary,  active  in  secret  printing,  a member  of  the 
Central  Committee  of  the  Russian  Communist  party  since  1922,  and  on  the  Praesidium  of 
the  Comintern  from  1930.  He  too  was  purged  in  1938. 


642 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


wore  kimonos  at  home;  Ivan  Kalinin,  who  came  in  occasionally  as  a con- 
sultant; and  Professor  Shungsky,  old,  distinguished,  vigorous,  the  section’s 
supreme  authority  on  Japanese.  He  gave  Doosia  (the  future  Mrs.  Petrov’s 
nickname)  an  affectionate  kiss  on  the  cheek  when,  after  four  years  of  his 
tutoring,  she  translated  a difficult  sentence  to  his  liking  at  her  final  examina- 
tion. 

Shungsky  had  served  in  the  czarist  Army,  and  many  others  in  the  crypt- 
analytic  section  were  elderly  former  Russian  aristocrats,  including  counts  and 
barons.  This  shocking  breach  of  Bolshevik  polity  resulted  from  a serious 
shortage  of  linguists,  who  were  needed  in  codebreaking.  Cryptanalysts  them- 
selves were  so  excessively  scarce  that  even  when  they  were  jailed  they  con- 
tinued to  work.  Vladimir  Krivosh,  the  father  of  Doosia’s  first  love  and  de 
facto  husband,  Roman  Krivosh,  had  held  a high  post  in  the  Okhrana;  he  was 
alternately  arrested  and  released,  but  worked  for  the  Spets-Otdel  even  while 
he  was  in  the  Butirskaya  Prison  in  Moscow.  Eventually  the  police  took  Roman 
away  to  the  same  prison,  but  the  head  of  his  section  in  what  was  then  the  5th 
Directorate  brought  him  his  work. 

There  was,  of  course,  no  security  problem  with  inmate-cryptanalysts.  But 
security  was  impressed  on  the  others.  They  were  not  allowed  to  tell  anyone 
the  department  in  which  they  worked  nor  even  where  the  office  was.  Doosia 
never  even  told  her  parents.  They  also  had  to  keep  out  of  restaurants,  pre- 
sumably because  their  conversations  might  be  overheard. 

Did  their  work  prosper?  It  did,  and  very  well  indeed.  In  1929  or  1930,  the 
Spets-Otdel  compiled  a weekly  precis  of  foreign  telegrams  that  it  had  solved 
and  sent  it  to  O.G.P.U.  department  heads  and  to  the  Central  Committee. 
By  1938,  the  pace  seems  to  have  accelerated,  for  by  then  Doosia  had  the  job 
with  a Madame  Moritz  of  checking  the  typed  fair  copies  that  represented 
each  day’s  output  against  their  handwritten  originals.  One  former  O.G.P.U. 
official  stated  that  the  Spets-Otdel  “carries  on  the  work  of  reading  codes 
splendidly”  and  praised  Boki’s  staffers  as  “a  first-class  lot,  often  cited  for 
emulation.” 

The  Soviet  military  establishment  seems  to  have  had  neither  the  tradition, 
the  work  force,  nor  the  success  in  cryptanalysis  that  the  secret  police  enjoyed. 
The  inclusion  of  a military  unit  within  the  Spets-Otdel  in  1933  testifies  to  this 
subordination.  In  any  event,  much  less  has  been  heard  of  it.  Probably  this  is 
because  each  branch  of  the  Soviet  armed  forces  restricts  itself  to  the  crypto- 
systems of  its  opposite  numbers — the  Red  Army  to  the  secret  communica- 
tions of  the  German,  Japanese,  British,  American,  and  other  armies,  and 
similarly  for  the  Red  Navy  and  Air  Force.  Cryptanalysis  naturally  constitutes 
a part  of  intelligence,  and  in  1941,  the  G.R.U.,  the  Army’s  Chief  Intelligence 
Directorate,  had  its  cryptanalytic  group  as  Section  8 of  the  eight  sections  of  its 
operations  branch:  (1)  Europe,  (2)  Near  East,  (3)  Western  Hemisphere  and 
India,  (4)  advanced  technical  information,  (5)  terroristic  activities,  (6)  pro- 
duction of  false  documents,  (7)  frontiers,  (8)  cryptology.  What  these  had  in 


Pycacan  KpunmoAOZU.H  643 

common  was  the  production  of  raw  military  intelligence  by  both  clandestine 
and  open  methods.  (In  addition  to  operations,  the  G.R.U.  had  three  other 
branches:  information,  which  evaluated  and  disseminated  operations’  output; 
training;  and  auxiliary,  which  handled  the  housekeeping  duties.) 

In  1943,  when  Soviet  military  intelligence  was  reorganized  into  strategic 
and  tactical  branches,  it  expanded  into  a block-square  baroque  palace  at  19 
Znamensky  Street,  while  retaining  its  former  quarters  in  a building  on  the 
square  at  the  Kropotkin  Gate.  There  were  also  several  auxiliary  buildings, 
including  a factory  for  photographic  paper  outside  of  Moscow,  nearly  all  of 
whose  output  was  consumed  by  a white  two-story  building  in  a yard  of  the 
intelligence  complex.  This  was  the  photographic  laboratory  that  produced 
and  developed  the  films  used  by  Soviet  military  intelligence  for  much  of  its 
mail  communication  with  its  agents  abroad.  What  appeared  to  be  a gold 
research  institute  on  the  Vorobiovy  Gory  was  actually  the  Osobyi  Radio 
Divizion  (“Special  Radio  Division”),  by  which  the  G.R.U.  maintained  radio 
contact  with  its  secret  agents  around  the  world.  When  Soviet  spies  tapped  out 
their  messages  to  the  impersonal  “Centre”  in  Moscow,  an  O.R.D.  radioman 
received  and  acknowledged  them.  And  when  the  agents  received  their  orders, 
curtly  signed  “Director”  (of  Soviet  military  intelligence),  the  O.R.D.  trans- 
mitted them.  It  was  their  only  link  with  the  agency  for  which  they  risked 
their  lives.  The  O.R.D.  was  also  staffed  with  radio  technicians,  who  assigned 
wavelengths  and  schedules  that  would  provide  optimum  reception  from 
various  points  on  the  globe,  and  with  clerks  who  allocated  call-signs. 

Cryptography  was  handled  in  a separate  G.R.U.  branch  headed  by 
Lieutenant  Colonel  Kravchenko.  Among  its  clerks  was  another  man  not  un- 
known to  future  fame — Igor  Gouzenko.  “I  well  remember  the  first  telegram  I 
was  given  to  decipher  at  Intelligence  Headquarters,”  he  wrote.  “It  came  from 

Harbin  [in  Manchuria] The  telegram  sounded  like  a page  from  a novel, 

giving  minute  details  of  the  hiding  place  [of  an  agent  s radio]  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  Governor-General’s  palace,  and  described  habits  of  the  people  living 
in  that  district.  . . . The  follow-up  telegram  was  then  given  me  for  coding.  It 
gave  instructions  for  meeting  the  pick-up  man  in  Harbin.  The  actual  street 
corner  and  the  alternative  street  corner  were  named  together  with  the  time, 
the  day,  tokens  of  recognition  and  passwords  to  be  used.”  Gouzenko  and  his 
fellow  clerks,  among  them  his  friend  Lieutenant  Burukin,  sometimes  followed 
agents  day  after  day,  living  in  imagination  all  the  thrills  and  danger  of  a spy  s 
life  as  they  routinely  deciphered  his  messages. 

Soviet  cipher  clerks  learned  their  trade  at  a number  of  schools.  Gouzenko 
took  the  basic  course  at  the  Kuibishev  Military  Engineering  Academy,  where 
the  political  director  was  an  owl-eyed  former  cipher  clerk  named  Maslennikov, 
nicknamed  Kriptus;  despite  his  twisted  body  and  rather  pathetic  personality, 
he  was  a good  teacher  and  knew  a lot  about  cryptography.  Gouzenko  got 
advanced  training  at  the  Higher  Red  Army  School,  generally  known  as  the 
Intelligence  Academy.  Cryptography  was  among  the  courses  taught  at  the 


644 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Red  Navy’s  Electric  Mine  School  at  the  big  base  at  Kronstadt;  here,  Petrov, 
as  a young  recruit,  first  studied  it  two  winters  and  two  springs,  going  to  sea 
during  the  summers  and  autumns.  The  course  included  some  cryptanalysis. 
Afterwards,  he  served  for  two  years  as  senior  cipher  rating  aboard  the 
destroyer  Volodarsky,  where  he  lived  and  worked  in  a small  cabin  under 
the  bridge.  His  military  service  completed,  he  left  the  Navy  and  joined  the 
O.G.P.U.  as  a cipher  clerk.  Cryptography  may  also  have  been  taught  in  the 
Red  Army’s  Military  School  for  Signal  Communication  in  Leningrad;  this 
would  be  for  use  with  the  troops.  The  Army  also  ran  a research  institute  for 
communications  at  Sokolniti  in  Moscow,  which,  since  it  encompassed  such 
exotic  studies  as  cosmic  rays,  almost  certainly  included  cryptography.  In 
1937  it  merged  with  another  institute  into  a central  scientific  research  institute 
for  the  Red  Army. 

The  strides  that  the  Russian  Army  had  made  in  cryptography  after  the 
traumatic  experiences  of  World  War  I were  dramatized  by  an  interchange  of 
messages  between  incredulous  Russian  units  at  the  very  start  of  the  Russo- 
German  War.  Moments  after  the  Nazis  launched  their  sneak  attack  at  3 : 30 
a.m.  June  22,  1941,  a Red  outpost  wirelessed  frantically,  “We  are  being  fired 
on.  What  shall  we  do?”  Back  came  the  stern  reply,  “You  must  be  insane. 
And  why  is  your  signal  not  in  code?” 

Red  Army  cryptography  rested  in  World  War  II  upon  the  enciphered  code. 
The  system  appeared  in  four  series:  5-digit  codes  for  strategic  messages,  4- 
digit  for  high-level  tactical  communications,  perhaps  of  the  rank  of  army 
headquarters,  3-digit  for  medium-level  tactical,  as  of  brigade  rank,  and  2- 
digit  for  the  front.  The  Soviets  replaced  their  tactical  codes  frequently,  al- 
though sometimes  a code  that  had  been  used  in  one  sector  of  their  thousand- 
mile  front  reappeared  later  in  another.  The  4-digit  codes  were  enciphered  by 
10  x 10  tables,  one  table  for  the  first  2 digits  and  another  for  the  second  pair. 
The  5-digit  codes  were  enciphered  by  additive  tables  of  300  groups  changed 
daily.  The  Army  and  Navy  shared  the  5-digit  strategic  system;  border  patrol 
and  N.K.V.D.  units  had  their  own  systems,  usually  4-digit.  In  addition,  the 
Soviets  got  some  Hagelin  m-209s  in  Lend  Lease,  which  they  apparently  used 
as  models  for  their  own  constructions,  though  it  is  not  known  where  these 
were  used. 

With  enough  traffic,  enciphered  code  can  of  course  be  read.  One  of  the 
first  to  do  so  in  the  case  of  the  Russian  military  was  the  Swedish  expert  Arne 
Beurling.  During  the  bitter  struggle  of  Finland  against  Russian  aggressors  in 
the  Winter  War  of  1939-1940,  Sweden  fed  intelligence  based  on  cryptanalysis 
to  her  neighbor.  Beurling  attacked  the  top  system,  the  5-digit  strategic,  which 
was  actually  a 4-digit  code  with  an  extra  digit  added  as  some  form  of  check. 
In  several  of  the  codes,  the  page  digit — the  second — was  repeated,  so  that  the 
groups  would  look  like  52217,  88824,  and  so  on.  In  others,  the  fifth  digit 
gave  the  unit  total  of  the  preceding  four  digits,  so  that  6432  would  have  a check 


PyccKan  KpunmoAozun  645 

digit  of  5,  making  the  codegroup  64325.  Beurling  wrote  the  cryptograms  on  a 
sheet  of  graph  paper  with  five-millimeter  squares  that  was  so  large — about 
3x4  feet — that  he  had  to  order  it  specially.  He  would  make  his  runs,  and, 
if  messages  overlapped,  he  would  be  on  his  way. 

Soviet  strategy  against  Finland  called  for  a five-pronged  invasion  along 
their  north-south  border.  The  middle  force  drove  for  the  tiny  village  of 
Suomussalmi  to  cut  Finland  at  her  waist;  the  force  just  north  of  that  one 
rolled  on  another  little  village,  Salla,  in  a secondary  cut-off.  But  intelligence 
developed  in  the  Swedish  cryptanalytic  office  helped  the  Finns  to  repulse  both 
Russian  attacks. 

Crucial  to  Marshal  Mannerheim’s  victory  at  Suomussalmi  was  the  in- 
formation that  the  Russian  44th  Division,  a crack  motorized  outfit  from 
Moscow,  was  advancing  from  Raate.  He  immediately  sent  reinforcements  to 
Suomussalmi.  Two  days  after  his  five  battalions  reached  there,  the  Finns, 
dressed  in  white  and  moving  like  the  ghosts  of  the  north,  attacked  the  Rus- 
sian forces  in  the  village,  broke  their  resistance,  and  forced  them  to  flee  across 
frozen  Lake  Kiantajarvi.  The  skiing  wraiths  then  cut  off  the  retreat  of  the  44th 
Division,  severed  its  column  and  destroyed  it  section  by  section  in  fighting 
that  continued  into  the  first  week  of  1940.  Large  quantities  of  stores  were 
captured,  but,  Mannerheim  wrote,  “The  enemy’s  casualties  could  not  be 
estimated,  as  great  snowdrifts  over  a large  area  covered  the  fallen  as  well  as 
the  wounded  who  were  frozen  to  death.” 

Temperatures  during  the  battle  dropped  to  56  degrees  below  zero,  and  it 
was  under  such  conditions  that  the  Swedes  solved  some  pitiful  messages  from 
isolated  Russian  units.  One  encircled  group  radioed  that  they  were  burning 
their  papers  and  were  going  to  shoot  their  last  horse  for  food,  and  that  this 
was  their  final  message.  Silence  followed,  and  soon  thereafter  the  Swedish 
cryptanalysts  learned  that  the  Finns  had  crushed  them.  Another  Russian 
battalion  sent  a coded  message  that  they  were  desperately  short  of  supplies 
and  would  build  three  fires  in  a triangle  to  show  the  Red  Air  Force  where  to 
parachute  desperately  needed  food  and  ammunition.  The  Swedes  solved  it  and 
gave  it  to  the  Finns,  who  built  a triangle  of  fires  and  watched  with  bitter  satis- 
faction as  the  packages  floated  down  into  it. 

Swarms  of  Russian  Air  Force  cryptograms  were  downed  by  the  Swedish 
codebreakers.  Many  were  orders  to  bomb  Helsinki,  and  often  these  were 
solved  before  the  bombers  took  off  from  airfields  in  Latvia  and  Estonia  for  the 
20-minute  flight  to  their  target.  Finnish  authorities  thus  had  ample  time  to 
sound  air-raid  alerts;  as  a result  the  capital  suffered  exceptionally  light  civilian 
casualties  considering  the  number  of  bombs  dropped. 

But  little  Finland  was  no  match  for  the  colossal  U.S.S.R.  despite  her 
cryptologic  advantages,  and  in  March  she  signed  a peace  treaty.  When  the 
Germans  invaded  Russia  a year  later,  Finland  declared  war  against  her 
harasser  and  later  exchanged  cryptographic  intercepts  with  her  new 
ally.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


German  radio  intelligence  against  the  Soviet  Union  appears  to  have  been 
characterized  by  a severe  split.  Strategically  it  enjoyed  no  success  at  all.  The 
Germans  did  not  solve  the  cryptosystems  of  the  top  Soviet  military  commands 
— primarily  the  5-digit  codes.  Perhaps  by  1941  the  Russians  had  corrected 
their  cryptographic  technique  enough  to  keep  the  Germans  from  repeating 
the  1939  Swedish  successes.  Whatever  the  reason,  cryptanalysis  contributed 
little  to  O.K.W.’s  overall  picture  of  Russian  strategy. 

Tactically,  however,  the  Germans  reaped  rich  harvests  of  intelligence.  In 
mid-1940,  when  Hitler  first  decided  to  attack  the  Soviet  Union,  Germany  had 
no  radio-intelligence  service  of  any  kind  in  the  East;  a year  later,  when  Hitler 
struck,  the  new  intercept  service  had  already  provided  him  with  good  informa- 
tion on  Russian  order  of  battle.  In  July,  a captured  Russian  Air  Force  cap- 
tain betrayed  one  of  the  Air  Force  systems.  This  intelligence  windfall  helped 
the  Luftwaffe  destroy  hundreds  of  Soviet  airplanes  on  the  ground  and  another 
hundred  in  a great  air  battle  over  Minsk. 

The  resultant  air  superiority,  plus  surprise,  momentum,  armor,  and  speed, 
carried  the  Wehrmacht  forward  in  a surge  of  victories.  In  1941  and  again  in 
1942  Germany  mounted  massive  offensives  and  overran  vast  areas  of  Russia. 
But  in  the  winter  of  1942-43,  Stalingrad  held  and  the  German  6th  Army 
capitulated;  at  the  same  time,  Germany  lifted  the  two-year  siege  of  Lenin- 
grad.  By  next  summer,  it  had  become  evident  that  Nazidom  could  not  win 
its  great  victory  over  Bolshevism,  but  the  troops  hoped  at  least  for  a stale- 
mate that  would  stabilize  their  conquests.  The  high  command  decided  on 
some  limited  attacks  to  cripple  Soviet  offensive  power.  With  the  waning  of 
Fuftwaffe  air  mastery,  Nazi  intelligence  had  to  depend  less  upon  aerial  re- 
connaissance and  more  upon  wireless  surveillance.  In  tactical  operations 
during  the  Battle  of  the  Dnieper  in  October,  1943,  the  chief  of  staff  of  the  48th 
Panzer  Corps  declared,  “The  best  and  most  reliable  source  of  intelligence  was 
our  Wireless  Intercept  Service.” 

A few  months  later,  that  corps  participated  in  one  of  the  attacks  that  Army 
Group  South,  one  of  the  three  major  German  groupings  on  the  Eastern 
Front,  mounted  to  flatten  the  Kiev  salient  and  further  forestall  Soviet  offen- 
sive propensities.  The  48th  Panzer  Corps  had  as  its  objective  the  disruption 
of  the  Russian  60th  Army.  Air  reconnaissance  produced  no  information,  and 
the  corps  decided  not  to  send  out  ground  scouts  for  fear  of  alerting  the 
Russians.  The  attack  at  6 a.m.  December  6 completely  surprised  the  Russians, 
who  recoiled  in  confusion. 

In  those  days  [wrote  the  corps’  chief  of  staff,  Colonel  F.  W.  von  Mellenthin] 
we  were  really  good  at  intercepting  Russian  wireless  traffic;  enemy  messages  were 
promptly  deciphered  and  passed  to  Corps  in  time  to  act  on  them.  We  were  kept 
well  informed  of  Russian  reactions  to  our  movements,  and  the  measures  they 
proposed  to  take,  and  we  modified  our  own  plans  accordingly.  At  first  the 
Russians  underestimated  the  importance  of  the  German  thrust.  Later  a few 
antitank  guns  were  thrown  into  the  fray.  Then  slowly  the  Russian  Command 


Pyccxan  KpunmoAozun  647 

got  worried.  Wireless  calls  became  frantic.  “Report  at  once  where  the  enemy 
comes  from.  Your  message  is  unbelievable.”  Reply:  “Ask  the  Devil’s  grand- 
mother; how  should  I know  where  the  enemy  comes  from?”  (Whenever  the 
Devil  and  his  near  relations  are  mentioned  in  Russian  signals  one  can  assume 
that  a crack-up  is  at  hand.)  Towards  noon  the  Russian  60th  Army  went  off  the 
air,  and  soon  afterwards  our  tanks  overran  the  army  headquarters. 

By  that  evening  the  Germans  had  rolled  up  the  Russian  front  for  20  miles, 
and  by  the  night  of  December  9 the  Soviets’  projected  offensive  was  jolted 
thoroughly  off  balance.  In  the  next  few  days  additional  blows  punished 
them  further.  “The  Russians  were  certainly  flabbergasted  by  these  ghost-like 
thrusts,  which  seemed  to  come  from  nowhere,  and  their  wireless  traffic  pro- 
vided abundant  evidence  of  their  bewilderment  and  anxiety,”  Mellenthin  wrote. 

This  German  victory  at  the  Battle  of  Radomyshl  delayed  but  did  not 
prevent  the  Russian  offense.  At  Christmas,  Army  Group  South  began  its 
retreat  from  the  Ukraine.  Several  months  later  the  Russians  had  driven  the 
Germans  back  650  miles  from  their  farthest  penetration. 

Mellenthin  has  remarked  that  “The  Red  Army  of  World  War  II  was 
vastly  different  from  the  Imperial  Russian  Army  of  1914-17,  but  in  two  im- 
portant respects  the  Russians  have  not  changed.  They  are  still  addicted  to 
mass  attacks,  and  they  still  show  an  extraordinary  indifference  to  wireless 
security.”  This  comment  seems  to  hold  true  only  in  a tactical  sense,  and  the 
adjective  “extraordinary”  is  probably  justified  only  under  conditions  of 
retreat  and  its  accompanying  confusion. 

Army  Group  North,  for  example,  read  5-digit  code  messages  very  rarely. 
Of  the  intercepts  in  2-,  3-,  and  4-digit  codes,  it  read  28.7  per  cent — 13,312  mes- 
sages out  of  46,342  from  the  beginning  of  May,  1943,  to  the  end  of  May,  1944, 
a year  in  which  the  Russians  pushed  back  the  northern  sector  of  the  front 
slightly,  though  not  nearly  as  much  as  the  southern.  A month-by-month  and 
system-by-system  breakdown  of  the  cryptanalytic  success  of  Army  Group 
North  (excluding  5-digit  codes)  is  shown  in  the  table  on  p.  648. 

As  might  be  expected,  the  2-digit  systems,  being  the  simplest,  succumbed 
the  oftenest.  However,  fewer  3-digit  than  the  presumably  more  difficult  4- 
digit  enciphered  codes  were  solved,  even  though  more  3-digit  messages  were 
picked  up.  The  reasons  for  this  seem  to  lie  partly  in  the  probable  concentration 
on  the  information-rich  4-digit  messages,  partly  in  the  many  more  3-digit 
systems  in  use  and  the  consequent  difficulty  of  finding  overlaps  to  strip  off 
the  additive  and  of  getting  sufficient  text  for  solutions.  This  multiplicity  of 
3-digit  systems  can  be  seen  in  the  number  of  new  3-digit  systems  reported 
solved  each  month  by  the  cryptanalysts,  which  is  invariably  greater  than  the 
number  of  new  4-digit  systems.  In  November,  1943,  for  example.  Army 
Group  North  solved  15  new  3-digit  systems  as  compared  to  one  4-digit;  in 
December,  the  figures  were  8 and  4,  in  January,  1944,  15  and  8.  The  crypt- 
analysts do  not  give  the  number  of  new  systems  introduced  by  the  Soviets 
that  the  Germans  did  not  solve. 


PyccKan  Kpunmonoeun  649 

Solved  messages,  said  the  cryptanalysts’  report  for  February,  1944, 
“contain  operational  combat  reports,  statements  about  assembly  areas,  com- 
mand posts,  loss  and  replacement  reports,  reports  about  chain  of  command 
and  positions  prepared  for  the  attack  (e.g.,  messages  of  the  122nd  Armored 
Brigade  on  February  14  and  17).  Besides  these  reports,  the  plaintexts  of  the 
messages  made  possible  the  identification  of  seven  armored  units,  including 
their  numerical  designations,  as  well  as  confirmation  of  twelve  armored  units. 
With  few  exceptions  the  material  could  be  worked  up  in  good  time  and  put 
to  use.”

/)  Russian  World  War  II  military  message  partially  solved  by  German  cryptanalysts 

These  tactical  solutions  could,  at  best,  produce  local  successes.  The  appar- 
ent failure  of  German  cryptanalysts  to  solve  Russia’s  strategic  cryptosystems, 
with  the  valuable  information  that  they  concealed,  led  one  German  crypt- 
analyst to  adjudge  that  Russia  lost  World  War  I in  the  ether  and  won  World 
War  II  there. 

A truth  he  never  suspected  may  lurk  in  his  apothegm.  For  the  Russians  may 
have  done  as  well  in  solving  German  cryptograms  as  in  protecting  their  own. 
By  1942  they  had  cracked  messages  in  the  Enigma,  a rotor  machine.  And  the 
Germans  themselves  paid  a left-handed  tribute  to  Soviet  cryptanalytic  perspi- 
cacity when  a 1943  conference  of  signal  officers  ruefully  ordered:  “It  is  for- 
bidden to  mark  the  Fiihrer’s  radio  messages  in  any  special  way.”

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


At  the  same  time,  the  Soviet  Union  guarded  her  diplomatic  flanks  by  the 
one-time  pad,  a practice  she  had  begun  in  1930.  Consequently  her  crucial 
Foreign  Office  messages  were  read  by  neither  foes,  nor  neutrals,  nor  allies. 
Any  schemes  that  she  may  have  instigated  against  those  who,  at  the  end  of 
the  war,  were  to  become  either  her  puppets  or  her  adversaries  remained 
among  the  most  inviolate  of  her  secrets. 

During  World  War  II,  the  secret  prospectors  of  the  G.R.U.  and  the 
N.K.V.D.  drilled  for  information  in  scores  of  places  all  over  the  world.  Three 
of  the  spy  crews  struck  gushers  of  it.  The  fabulous  “Lucy”  network  in 
Switzerland,  the  Rote  Kapelle  in  Germany,  and  the  Sorge  ring  in  Japan 
pumped  a continuous  stream  of  the  most  detailed  and  precise  intelligence  into 
the  Kremlin.  And  this  they  did  through  a pipeline  that,  despite  the  most 
strenuous  bangings  and  poundings  of  counterintelligence,  remained  hermetic- 
ally sealed  against  cryptanalysis.  All  three  rings  employed  the  then-standard 
Soviet  espionage  cipher.  It  achieved  a triumph  of  encipherment,  for  it  is  a 
system  that  the  spymasters  of  the  Soviet  Union  rightly  regarded  as  un- 
breakable. 

It  brought  the  old  Nihilist  substitution  to  a peak  of  perfection.  It  merged 
the  straddling  checkerboard  with  the  one-time  key. 

It  increased  the  efficiency  of  the  checkerboard  by  specifically  giving  the 
high-frequency  letters  the  single  digits.  This  cut  down  the  length  of  the  crypto- 
grams and  hence  time  on  the  air.  Both  Max  Clausen,  radio  operator  for  the 
Sorge  net,  and  Alexander  Foote  of  the  Swiss  ring,  enciphered  in  English,  and 
consequently  they  used  the  eight  most  common  letters  of  that  language. 
They  memorized  them  by  the  rather  ominous  phrase  “a  sin  to  er(r).”  How- 
ever, the  sequence  of  those  letters  played  no  part  in  the  construction  of  the 
key  alphabet. 

For  that  construction,  a keyword  was  selected.  Clausen  used  SUBWAY. 
The  encipherer  wrote  this  out,  followed  by  the  rest  of  the  alphabet  in  rows 
beneath  it,  with  a full  stop  and  a letter-number  switch  sign  at  the  end.  Then 
the  digits  0 to  7 were  assigned  to  ASINTOER  as  they  occurred  vertically  in 
columns  from  left  to  right.  Finally  the  two-digit  groups  from  80  to  99  were 
assigned  to  the  remaining  letters  and  symbols,  also  vertically:

The  encipherer  next  replaced  his  plaintext  with  his  checkerboard  equiva- 
lents. For  numbers,  he  enciphered  the  switch  sign,  then  repeated  the  digits 
twice,  then  enciphered  the  switch  sign  again  to  indicate  a return  to  letters : 

whereis  / 1 0 6 / division 

91  98  3 4 3 1 0 94  11  00  66  94  83  1 99  1 0 1 2 7 

The  next  step  enshrouded  this  simple  text  by  adding  a numerical  key — an 
operation  called  “closing.”  Clausen  and  Foote  took  their  keynumbers 
directly  from  a common  reference  book  with  many  tables,  like  the  World 
Almanac,  possession  of  which  would  not  necessarily  be  suspicious.  Foote 
used  a book  of  Swiss  trade  statistics,  Clausen  the  1935  edition  of  the  Statis- 
lisches  Jahrbuch  fur  das  Deutches  Reich — the  main  section,  on  white  pages, 
for  enciphering,  the  international  survey  section,  on  separately  numbered 
green-tinted  pages  in  the  rear,  for  deciphering. 

The  message  requesting  information  about  the  106th  Division  resembles 
one  actually  sent  to  the  Sorge  ring  on  March  3,  1940.  Since  Clausen  would  be 
deciphering  it,  it  was  enciphered  in  Moscow  with  an  additive  from  the  green 
pages  of  the  Statistisches  Jahrbuch.  The  encipherer  picked  at  random  the 
group  at  the  1 1th  row  in  the  3rd  column  of  page  171.  That  group  happens  to 
give  the  thousands  of  metric  tons  of  foundry  products  fabricated  for  railroad 
construction  in  Luxembourg  in  1931,  which  was  113.  The  encipherer  began, 
as  an  enciphering  rule  required,  with  the  third  digit,  3,  and  then  ran  along  that 
line  in  the  table,  taking  his  other  keydigits  from  the  production  figures  for 
Belgium,  France,  Great  Britain,  and  so  on  for  1931  and  succeeding  years: 
134,  534,  517,  and  so  on.  These  digits  he  wrote  beneath  the  checkerboard 
encipherment  and  added  them  with  noncarrying  addition  to  produce  the 
cipher: 

checkerboard  “plain"  919834310941  10066948319910127 
key  31345345171831281  1951  10418847 

cipher  22228776165941247033429328964 

The  encipherer  divided  this  into  groups  of  five,  22228  77616  59412  47033 
42932  8964,  with  perhaps  a 0 at  the  end  to  fill  out  the  group.  He  then  com- 
posed an  indicator  group  to  tell  the  decipherer  where  to  find  the  key:  1 1 for 
the  row,  3 for  the  column,  71  for  the  page  (hundreds  figures  were  omitted; 
presumably  the  decipherer  would  have  to  try  page  71  or  271  if  page  17 l’s  key 


652 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


did  not  make  sense).  To  conceal  this  indicator  group,  11371,  the  encipherer 
added  to  it,  by  noncarrying  addition,  the  fourth  group  from  the  beginning 
of  the  message,  47033,  and  the  fourth  group  from  the  end,  59412,  to  give 
07716.  He  placed  this  group  at  the  head  of  the  message  and  gave  it  to  the 
radioman  to  send. 

This  was  the  standard  Soviet  spy  cipher  of  World  War  II.  Later  in  the  war, 
when  Foote  was  enciphering,  a few  minor  improvements  had  been  made  to 
improve  reliability  and  security.  Numbers  were  repeated  three  times  instead 
of  twice.  Instead  of  just  one  enciphered  indicator  group,  two  were  used. 
Foote  composed  them  by  adding  the  plain  page-column-line  indicator  to  a 
fixed  group  (his  was  69696)  and  then,  for  the  first  enciphered  indicator,  he 
added  this  sum  to  the  fifth  ciphertext  group  from  the  beginning,  and,  for  the 
second,  to  the  fifth  ciphertext  group  from  the  end.  He  then  inserted  these  en- 
ciphered indicator  groups  as  the  third  group  and  the  third  from  last  group  of 
the  final  cryptogram. 

Other  Soviet  spies,  however,  used  a variation  of  this  basic  system  that  was 
both  more  complicated  and  less  secure.  It  generated  the  key  digits  from  the 
text  of  an  ordinary  book  by  enciphering  that  text  in  a checkerboard.  The 
Rote  Kapelle  used  this  variation  (when  the  Germans  discovered  one  of  the 
keybooks,  a unit  of  the  Rote  Kapelle  wirelessed,  “Klaus  has  the  Bible”).  So 
did  some  members  of  Foote’s  Swiss  ring,  who  used  Es  geschah  im  September 
(“It  Happened  in  September”),  and  Bertil  E.  G.  Eriksson,  a Soviet  spy 
arrested  in  Sweden  in  1941,  who  used  a 1940  Swedish  edition  of  Jaroslav 
Hasek’s  The  Good  Soldier  Schweik. 

The  first  words  of  Eriksson’s  keytext  also  served  to  construct  his  keying 
checkerboard.  For  one  such  construction,  Eriksson  chose  to  begin  at  page  12, 
line  3,  word  4:  “PAUS,  SOM  SVEJK  SJALV  AVBROT. . . .”  He  inscribed 
the  first  ten  different  letters  into  a straddling  checkerboard  as  its  first  line  and 
followed  them  on  other  rows  with  the  remaining  letters  of  the  alphabet.  He 
then  produced  a numerical  key  for  the  top  coordinates  by  numbering  the 
letters  in  the  top  row  from  0 to  9 according  to  their  alphabetical  position.  The 
first  line  was  given  no  side  coordinates;  the  two  other  lines  got  their  coordin- 
ates from  those  standing  above  the  first  and  last  blank  spaces  in  the  last  line. 
The  result  :

He  then  began  his  keytext  with  the  third  letter  of  the  first  word  of  the  keyline, 
and  enciphered  Hasek’s  words  to  produce  his  additive:  “[DE]T  BLEV  EN

Soviet  spy  Bertil  E.  G.  Eriksson  enciphers  a message  for  Moscow  in  1941 . The 
upper  line  is  the  additive  key,  produced  by  enciphering  through  a straddling  checker- 
board a text  beginning  at  page  12,  line  3,  word  1,  letter  3,  of  a 1940  Swedish  edition 
of  Jaroslav  Hasek's  The  Good  Soldier  Schweik;  the  lower  line  is  the  plaintext,  in 
Russian,  based  on  a straddling  checkerboard  with  key  GAMBUSIA 


654 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


a numerical  plaintext  produced  via  a Russian  straddling  checkerboard  of  35 
cells  based  on  the  keyword  GAMBUS1A  (a  genus  of  minnows)  and  with 
seven  high-frequency  Russian  letters  given  single  digits. 

This  variant  of  the  standard  system  is  not  unbreakable.  The  use  of  a 
coherent  keytext  gives  the  cryptanalyst  a leverage  which  enables  him  to 
mutually  recover  both  it  and  the  plaintext.  The  straddling  feature,  the 
irregular  lengths  of  the  plain  and  key  elements,  destroys  the  ordinary  one- 
to-one  correspondence  between  plain,  cipher,  and  key  and  makes  his  work 
more  difficult  than  if  an  ordinary  checkerboard  had  been  used;  nevertheless, 
solution  is  possible.  It  is  probably  not  possible  analytically  with  trade  statis- 
tics as  a key.  Though  such  keys  are  not  ideal  because  they  may  contain  certain 
regularities  owing  to  recurrent  annual  figures  and  because  they  are  public,  they 
certainly  offer  adequate  security. 

How  did  this  standard  Soviet  system,  so  simple  but  so  strong,  serve  Russia 
during  World  War  II? 

Dr.  Richard  Sorge,  a tall,  stocky  man  with  malevolent  eyes,  worked  in 
Japan  as  a correspondent  for  Germany’s  finest  newspaper,  the  Frankfurter 
Zeitung.  A member  of  the  Nazi  party,  he  was  an  intimate  of  the  German 
ambassador,  Eugen  Ott,  with  whom  he  had  been  friends  since  Ott  had  been 
assistant  military  attache.  Sorge  even  served  as  press  attache  for  the  German 
embassy,  and,  while  breakfasting  with  Ott,  read  and  discussed  papers  and 
policies  with  him.  Then  he  passed  this  high-level  intelligence  to  Germany’s 
avowed  enemy,  the  Soviet  Union.  For  the  efficient  Germans  had  somehow 
failed  to  discover  that  Sorge’s  grandfather  had  been  secretary  to  Karl  Marx 
and  that  he  himself  was  a dedicated  Communist. 

Sorge  had  directed  a Soviet  spy  ring  in  Shanghai  from  1929  to  1931,  and 
the  ability  he  had  demonstrated,  plus  his  interest  in  the  Far  East,  caused  the 
G.R.U.  to  send  him  to  Japan  two  years  later  under  his  journalistic  cover.  His 
assignment  was  to  ascertain  the  intentions  of  Japan,  Russia’s  former  enemy 
and  only  rival  in  the  Western  Pacific  and  holder  of  an  Oriental  dagger  that  she 
could  plunge  into  Russia’s  back.  Sorge  painstakingly  built  up  his  own  con- 
tacts and  recruited  agents  among  the  Japanese.  His  most  important  catch 
was  Hotsumi  Ozaki,  who  was  a kind  of  Harry  Hopkins  to  Prince  Konoye, 
thrice  premier  of  Japan.  Sorge  thus  had  a direct  pipeline  into  the  highest 
councils  of  the  Japanese  government,  while  he  himself  had  access  to  the  best 
information  and  opinions  of  Japan’s  ally.  In  addition,  more  than  two  dozen 
other  Japanese  supplied  important  bits  of  military  and  economic  intelligence. 

Sorge  sent  this  information  to  Russia  by  film  through  couriers  and  by 
radio.  His  radio  operator  was  Max  G.  F.  Clausen,  a heavy-set  German  with 
pleasant  features  and  curly  hair  who  had  served  as  a radioman  in  the  German 
signal  corps  during  World  War  I and  had  worked  with  Sorge  in  Shanghai.  As 
cover,  he  sold  machinery  for  blueprint  reproduction  in  a private  enterprise 
that  was  so  phenomenally  successful  that  it  severely  shook  his  faith  in 


Pyccnan  Kpunmonozun  655 

Communism:  in  1941,  he  sent  only  a third  of  the  messages  that  Sorge  gave 
him.  But  at  first  he  performed  miracles  in  establishing  and  maintaining  radio 
contact  over  very  long  distances  with  a portable  transmitter  that  he  had  built 
himself.  He  set  it  up  for  sending,  and  dismantled  it  and  carried  it  away  in  a 
large  briefcase  after  each  transmission.  This  almost  backfired  one  night  when  he 
and  another  agent  had  the  radio  in  its  case  with  them  and  were  stopped  by  a 
policeman.  “My  heart  jumped  at  the  thought  that  we  had  been  discovered,” 
he  wrote.  “For  some  reason  or  other,  the  policeman  merely  remarked,  ‘Your 
headlights  are  out;  be  careful,’  and  walked  away  without  examining  our 
baggage  or  searching  us.” 

With  the  approach  of  war,  the  Sorge  ring  accelerated  its  communications. 
Transmissions,  which  had  been  made  irregularly,  began  in  1938  to  be  made 
regularly:  on  odd  days  and  Sundays  at  3 p.m.  and  the  following  mornings  at 
10.  Clausen  sent  to  a Russian  station  codenamed  Wiesbaden,  which  he  thought 
was  probably  in  Vladivostok,  possibly  in  Khabarovsk  or  Komsomolsk;  the 
messages  were  relayed  from  there  to  Moscow.  At  first  Clausen  merely  trans- 
mitted already  coded  messages,  but  after  Sorge  was  in  a motorcycle  accident 
in  1938,  he  obtained  permission  from  Moscow  to  teach  Clausen  the  cipher 
system. 

“I  always  encoded  and  decoded  at  my  home  in  a room  used  only  by  my- 
self,” the  radio  operator  wrote.  “Usually  I was  warned  of  visitors  by  the  ring 
of  the  doorbell  so  that  I could  clean  up  my  papers  before  receiving  them.  On 
three  occasions,  my  Japanese  employees  saw  the  code  but  did  not  seem  to  pay 
any  attention  to  it.  Once,  when  I was  in  bed  [this  appears  to  refer  to  his  being 
bedridden  from  April  to  August,  1941,  by  a heart  ailment]  and  encoding  a 
message  (employing  a special  board  which  enabled  me  to  work  in  a reclining 
position),  Dr.  Wurtz,  who  was  always  shown  in  by  the  maid,  suddenly  ap- 
peared at  my  bedside  alone.  He  glanced  down  at  the  code  chart  suspiciously 
but  merely  said,  ‘You  must  not  do  any  writing  until  you  get  well,’  went  through 
a routine  checkup,  and  departed.  For  several  days  I was  afraid  that  he  might 
have  informed  the  police,  but  nothing  came  of  it.”  His  messages  went  out  in 
English,  sometimes  German,  never  Russian— to  conceal  the  true  allegiance 
of  the  ring. 

Sorge  had  discovered  not  only  that  Germany  was  planning  to  attack 
Russia,  but  also  the  approximate  date.  Stalin  ignored  the  information,  as  he 
had  other  invasion  tips,  and  was  taken  by  surprise.  With  the  war  on,  the 
moment  for  which  Sorge  and  his  ring  had  prepared  ever  since  their  arrival  in 
Japan  was  at  hand.  They  bent  every  effort  to  discover  the  one  piece  of  in- 
formation that  both  Sorge  and  the  Soviet  government  considered  the  most 
vital  to  Russia’s  conduct  of  the  war,  perhaps,  in  fact,  to  her  very  existence: 
Would  Japan  attack  Russia  at  this  moment  of  weakness  and  “shake  hands 
with  Hitler  in  the  Urals,”  or  would  she  pursue  her  already  well-laid  plans  to 
conquer  Malaya  and  the  Dutch  East  Indies  with  their  rubber  and  oil?  Japan 
made  her  decision  in  deepest  secrecy  at  a cabinet  meeting  of  July  2 in  the 


656  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

presence  of  the  Emperor.  As  hints  and  portions  of  it  leaked  out,  the  ring  sent 
Russia  increasing  amounts  of  information. 

In  1939,  Clausen  sent  23,139  cipher  groups,  in  1940,  29,179,  and  though, 
in  1941,  increasingly  disillusioned  with  Communism,  he  sent  only  13,301, 
Sorge  more  than  took  up  the  slack,  himself  sending  40,000  groups.  Much  of 
this  traffic  was  intercepted  by  Japanese  counterespionage  police.  The  Com- 
munications Ministry,  the  Tokyo  Metropolitan  Communications  Bureau,  the 
Osaka  Communications  Bureau,  and  the  Communications  Bureau  of  the 
Governor  General  of  Korea  had  all  been  aware  since  at  least  1938  that  an 
illegal  radio  was  transmitting  from  the  Tokyo  area.  Japanese  cryptanalysts 
failed  utterly  to  solve  the  messages,  and  their  radio  policemen  failed  equally 
to  locate  the  clandestine  transmitter.  These  two  failures  precluded  the  Japan- 
ese both  from  rounding  up  the  ring  and  from  feeding  it  false  information. 

Various  political  considerations  made  it  gradually  clearer  to  Sorge  that 
Japan  had  decided  against  marching  to  meet  Hitler.  Throughout  the  summer, 
as  German  columns  rolled  across  the  steppes,  he  communicated  these  develop- 
ments to  Moscow.  Finally,  Ozaki  confirmed  the  decision  for  the  southward 
advance  and  against  war  with  Russia,  and,  early  in  October,  Sorge  reported 
his  final  sober  conclusion : “There  will  be  no  attack  until  the  spring  of  next 
year  at  the  earliest.”  The  Soviet  Union  had  begun  drawing  troops  from  its 
eastern  reservoirs  of  manpower  as  Sorge’s  reports  grew  increasingly  optimistic. 
Now,  just  as  his  definitive  message  was  reaching  Moscow,  the  Germans 
launched  an  all-out  two-pronged  attack  to  capture  the  Russian  capital  before 
winter. 

The  Red  command,  no  longer  fearing  a Japanese  stab  in  the  back,  reduced 
its  Far  Eastern  garrison  by  15  infantry  and  3 cavalry  divisions  and  by  1,700 
tanks  and  1,500  planes.  It  transported  these  troops,  which  Germany  thought 
it  could  not  possibly  possess,  across  the  biggest  country  in  the  world  to  its 
Western  Front.  These  fresh  troops,  plus  the  worsening  winter,  slowed  the 
German  advance,  but  the  Germans  repeatedly  punched  holes  in  the  horseshoe 
of  the  city’s  defenses  with  “fists”  of  massed  armor.  On  December  2,  they 
reached  the  suburb  of  Khimki:  in  the  distance,  the  onion  domes  of  the 
Kremlin  cathedrals  pricked  the  leaden  sky!  The  next  day,  Marshal  Georgi 
Zhukov  flung  his  newly  arrived  reserves  into  a furious  counterattack,  and, 
aided  by  weather  13  degrees  below  zero,  drove  the  half-frozen  Nazis  back. 
Within  five  days,  Berlin  announced  the  suspension  of  the  eastern  offensive. 
Moscow  had  not  fallen.  The  ikon  of  Holy  Russia  still  stood. 

Not  so  Sorge.  A Japanese  who  was  not  in  his  ring  had  been  arrested  on 
suspicion  of  Communist  activities.  To  ingratiate  himself,  he  told  of  suspicious 
activities  by  a woman  who  was  a member  of  the  ring.  Her  confession  led, 
through  a long  chain,  to  the  arrest  of  Ozaki  on  October  15  and  of  Sorge  and 
Clausen  on  the  18th.  Clausen  broke  down  under  interrogation  and  disclosed 
the  cipher  system;  the  Japanese,  finally  able  to  read  the  tantalizing  messages, 
produced  them  as  damning  evidence  in  the  trial.  Clausen  was  sentenced  to

life  imprisonment.  Ozaki  and  Sorge  were  hanged  50  minutes  apart  on 
November  7,  1944.  But,  more  than  most  men,  they  had  fulfilled  their 
missions. 

Perhaps  the  most  widespread  of  the  Soviet  networks  was  one  the  Germans 
called  the  Rote  Kapelle  (the  “Red  Orchestra”).  Its  tentacles  slithered  into  the 
most  secret  tabernacles  of  Naziism,  and  its  loose  ramifications  covered  much 
of  Germany  and  occupied  Europe.  It  derived  its  name  from  the  steady  hum 
of  the  “music  boxes” — Soviet  term  for  radio  transmitters — in  Berlin,  Paris, 
Brussels,  Ostend,  Marseilles  and  elsewhere  that  piped  out  the  coded  informa- 
tion of  300  agents.  Its  maestro  was  Harro  Schulze-Boysen,  a Fuftwaffe 
lieutenant  in  the  Forschungsamt  who  came  from  an  impeccable  German 
family  that  included  Admiral  von  Tirpitz;  he  had  himself  moved  gradually 
from  a conservative  anti-Naziism  to  pro-Communism.  Concertmaster  was 
the  fortyish  Arvid  Harnack,  nephew  of  the  influential  theological  historian, 
Adolf  von  Harnack.  And  the  manager  was  Feopold  Trepper,  “grand  chef”  of 
Soviet  espionage  in  the  West,  a professional  spy  director  who  had  established 
himself  at  Paris  under  the  cover  of  the  Simex  Corporation. 

The  organization  that  he  built  up  under  Schulze-Boysen  and  Harnack 
remained  latent  until  the  Germans  crossed  the  border  on  June  22,  1941. 
Instantly  Moscow  demanded  information  on  German  plans.  The  Rote 
Kapelle  sprang  to  life.  Soon  the  cricketlike  chorus  of  its  Morse  transmitters 
filled  the  ether  with  their  incessant  chirpings  of  five-digit  groups. 

In  Cranz,  in  East  Prussia,  the  antennae  of  the  Funkabwehr,  the  Nazi  radio 
counterespionage,  quivered.  The  first  message  was  intercepted  June  26. 
Attempts  to  solve  it  and  those  that  followed  failed.  Tracking  down  the  trans- 
mitters themselves  was  hindered  by  a shortage  of  equipment:  the  Funkab- 
wehr then  had  only  six  long-range  direction-finders.  Not  until  October  did  it 
ascertain  that  Moscow  was  receipting  for  the  messages.  Not  until  December 
did  it  pinpoint  its  first  Rote  Kapelle  station.  On  the  night  of  the  13th,  a troop 
of  soldiers  wearing  socks  over  their  boots  silently  climbed  to  the  second  floor 
of  a villa  at  101  Rue  des  Attrebates  in  Brussels.  They  broke  into  the  radio 
room  and  arrested  the  cryptographer-radioman,  Mikhail  Makarov,  a Rus- 
sian Air  Force  lieutenant  and  a relative  of  Soviet  Foreign  Minister  Vyacheslav 
Molotov,  and  two  other  agents.  At  this  very  moment,  Trepper  himself  arrived. 
But  with  superhuman  aplomb,  he  passed  himself  off  as — of  all  things — a 
rabbit  vendor,  and  was  not  apprehended. 

The  Germans  also  found  in  the  fireplace  of  the  villa  a charred  piece  of 
paper  covered  with  numbers;  it  was  obviously  an  enciphering  worksheet. 
German  cryptanalysts  immediately  began  to  study  it.  Makarov  refused  to 
talk,  and  it  was  not  until  six  weeks  later  that  the  first  significant  information 
emerged.  It  was  part  of  a sentence  in  French  that  seemed  more  like  a fragment 
of  keytext  than  of  plaintext,  and  it  contained  the  word  PROCTOR.  The 
Funkabwehr  questioned  the  landlady,  a naive  elderly  widow,  who  named 
eleven  books  that  she  had  seen  her  tenants  reading.  In  Le  miracle  clu  Professeur 


658  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Wolmar,  a 286-page  science-fiction  novel  by  Guy  de  Teramond,  the  Nazis 
found  PROCTOR. 

Suddenly  the  Germans  saw  the  magnitude  of  what  they  were  faced  with. 
The  Teramond  key  unlocked  120  messages  of  what  had  been  the  busiest  Rote 
Kapelle  station.  These  had  warned  Moscow  of  Germany’s  spring  offensive  in 
the  Caucasus,  reported  on  Luftwaffe  strength,  provided  data  on  army  fuel 
consumption  and  casualties,  and  furnished  similar  other  vital  information. 
But  all  names  were  codenames;  the  three  arrested  agents  either  would  not  or 
could  not  give  links  to  the  rest  of  the  network.  The  Funkabwehr  redoubled 
its  efforts. 

Trepper,  however,  after  his  melodramatic  evasion,  had  alerted  the  other 
members  of  the  Rote  Kapelle.  Couriers  brought  them  new  keys.  Soon  the 
orchestra  was  playing  with  renewed  volume.  Many  of  the  numbers  were 
requests  by  Moscow: 

To  gilbert  [codename  for  Trepper]  from  Director.  Check  whether  Guderian 

[German  panzer  general]  really  at  Eastern  front.  Are  the  2d  and  3d  Armies  under 

his  command?  . . . 

To  gilbert  from  Director.  Report  about  26  armored  divisions  being  formed  in 

France. 

The  intelligence  came  from  informants  throughout  the  entire  Nazi  regime. 
Schulze-Boysen  himself  was  pivotally  located  in  the  Forschungsamt.  Harnack 
held  a high  post  in  the  Economics  Ministry  as  an  expert  on  the  Soviet  Union. 
The  Rote  Kapelle  had  sources  in — among  others — the  Foreign  Office,  the 
Luftwaffe’s  counterintelligence,  the  labor  and  propaganda  ministries,  and,  in 
the  person  of  young  Horst  Heilmann,  an  apostate  from  Naziism,  in  the  crypt- 
analytic  office  of  the  Army.  The  arrhythmic  monotone  of  its  radio  trans- 
mitters made  beautiful  music  to  Moscow.  They  sang  to  the  Russians  of 
German  plans  to  encircle  Leningrad  instead  of  occupying  it,  of  exact  times 
of  German  parachute  raids,  of  monthly  aircraft  production,  of  a Soviet 
code  found  at  Petsamo  in  Finland,  Luftwaffe  losses,  Luftwaffe  production, 
capabilities  of  a new  Messerschmidt  fighter,  production  of  synthetic  fuel, 
foreign  policy  developments,  political  opposition  to  Naziism,  troop  move- 
ments along  the  Dnieper.  The  Russian  bear  performed  to  these  tunes,  knowing 
just  where  and  how  to  claw  and  slash  the  Nazi  forces. 

The  Funkabwehr  monitors  listened  as  this  symphony  reverberated  through 
the  ether.  To  them,  it  was  cacophony.  The  cryptograms  remained  impervious. 
But  the  transmitters  could  be  tracked  down,  and  on  June  30,  1942,  another 
Belgian  group,  headed  by  a veteran  Communist  agent,  Johann  Wenzel,  whose 
thorough  knowledge  of  radio  techniques  had  earned  him  the  sobriquet  “The 
Professor,”  was  raided  in  Brussels;  Wenzel  was  nabbed  in  front  of  his  set. 
The  Gestapo  took  over,  and  what  the  most  energetic  mental  thumping  of  an 
impersonal  string  of  numbers  had  not  done,  a moderate  physical  truncheon- 
ing of  human  flesh  did.  The  Professor’s  wide  acquaintance  with  Soviet  spy 


tyccKan  KpunmoAozun  659 

communications  soon  had  the  Funkabwehr  translating  its  file  of  back  inter- 
cepts. In  one  of  them,  almost  a year  old,  they  read  the  true  addresses  of 
Schulze-Boysen  and  Harnack.  . . . 

Of  all  Soviet  networks  during  the  war,  by  far  the  most  important  was  the 
Swiss.  It  owed  its  supremacy  in  part  to  its  location  in  neutral  Switzerland, 
where  it  operated  for  a long  time  out  of  reach  of  the  German  Abwehr,  and  in 
part  to  having  in  the  network  the  agent  codenamed  lucy,  whom  many 
regarded  as  the  greatest  spy  of  the  war.  This  was  Rudolf  Rossler,  a small, 
quiet,  bespectacled  German  publisher  of  leftist  Catholic  books  whose  code- 
name  came  from  his  residence  in  Lucerne.  His  sources  appear  to  have  been 
ten  World  War  I companions,  all  German  officers,  five  of  whom  became 
generals  and  served  at  least  part  of  the  time  in  the  Oberkommando  der 
Wehrmacht.  One  was  General  Fritz  Thiele,  who  had  the  O.K.W.’s  Chif- 
frierabteilung  under  him  and  who,  as  No.  2 man  in  the  O.K.W.  signal 
organization,  used  its  facilities  to  radio  messages  to  Rossler.  Thus  he  procured 
intelligence  of  exalted  importance  and  precise  accuracy  with  dazzling  speed 
from  the  very  heart  of  the  German  High  Command  itself. 

Head  of  the  ring  was  Alexander  Rado,  a cartographer  whose  maps  ap- 
peared daily  in  the  Swiss  newspapers.  A Hungarian  Communist,  he  had  been 
sent  to  Switzerland  to  set  up  a ring  in  1936.  Second  in  command  and  chief 
radioman  was  Alexander  Foote,  a bearlike,  unperturbable  Englishman  in  his 
mid-thirties  who  pretended  to  be  living  in  Switzerland  on  independent  funds 
to  escape  military  service.  Early  in  1941  he  installed  in  his  flat  at  2 Chemin 
de  Longeraie,  Lausanne,  the  radio  station  that  was  to  be  known  as  jim.  On 
March  1 2,  after  a thousand  tappings  of  the  call-sign  frx,  he  heard  the  Moscow 
Centre  calling  him  through  the  crackle  of  static  and  the  background  noise  of 
other  transmissions:  nda  nda  ok  qrk  5,  the  latter  meaning  in  the  radio  Q 
code  that  his  signals  were  being  heard  very  strongly. 

The  Swiss  group  produced  results  quickly.  One  night  in  the  middle  of 
June,  Foote  sent  off  to  Moscow  a brief  but  vital  message: 

dora  [codename  for  Rado]  to  Director,  via  Taylor  [a  courier].  Hitler  has 

definitely  set  June  22  for  attack  on  Russia. 

This  had  no  more  effect  on  Stalin  than  had  Sorge  s information,  for 
Stalin  evidently  regarded  the  obvious  community  of  interest  between  Hitler 
and  himself  in  subduing  England  and  dismembering  her  empire  as  out- 
weighing information  from  two  individuals.  The  incident  spotlights  one  of 
the  most  difficult  problems  in  the  assessment  of  intelligence:  credibility. 

At  first  Foote  contacted  Moscow  only  twice  a week.  But  when  the  Russo- 
German  war  broke  out,  he  was  informed  that  the  Centre  would  be  listening 
to  him  round  the  clock.  Priorities  were  established:  vyrdo  for  exceedingly 
urgent  messages,  rdo  for  urgent,  and  msg  for  routine.  Moscow  was  always  in 
a hurry  for  information,  and  Foote,  who  operated  as  a sort  of  loner,  transmitted 
most  of  the  lucy  material  and  received  the  vyrdo  messages  pertaining  to  it.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


For  two  years  his  life  fell  into  a routine  that  indicates  the  unglamorous  ways 
of  a spy.  After  a night  of  enciphering  and  radioing,  he  rose  about  10,  spent  the 
morning  maintaining  his  pose  of  emigre  Englishman  and  the  afternoon 
journeying  to  meet  a cut-out,  or  courier,  at  some  unobserved  place.  “Having 
returned,’’  he  wrote,  “I  usually  had  a long  evening’s  ciphering  before  me. 
According  to  the  rules,  all  ciphering  should  have  been  done  after  dark  and 
behind  locked  doors.  But  needs  must  when  the  Centre  drove  and  in  the  more 
hectic  times  I was  enciphering  in  all  my  spare  moments.”  During  his  active 
period,  Foote  sent  2,000  messages,  or  about  six  a day.  They  averaged  100 
words  each. 

Contact  with  the  Centre  was  made  on  a fixed  wavelength.  The  Centre 
would  reply  on  its  fixed  length.  Both  would  then  switch  to  another  wave- 
length with  a different  call-sign  for  the  evening’s  work.  “My  transmission 
time  was  usually  about  one  in  the  morning,”  Foote  wrote,  “If  conditions 
were  good  and  the  message  short  1 was  through  in  about  a couple  of  hours.  If, 
as  frequently  happened,  I had  long  messages  to  send  and  atmospherics  were 
bad  I had  to  fight  my  way  through  and  send  when  and  as  conditions  allowed. 
Often  on  such  occasions  1 was  still  at  the  transmitter  at  six  and  once  or  twice 
I ‘signed  off’  at  nine  in  the  morning.  ...  To  be  on  the  air  for  that  length  of 
time  broke  all  the  normal  precautions  against  radio  monitoring.  But  it  was  a 
chance  which  had  to  be  taken  if  the  intelligence  was  to  be  passed  over,  a risk 
which  the  Centre  took  despite  frequent  admonitions  by  Rado  and  me.” 

As  the  Germans  approached  Moscow,  communications  became  in- 
creasingly difficult,  and  suddenly,  at  twelve  hours’  notice  to  the  senior  staff 
and  none  at  all  to  its  radio  agents,  the  Centre  was  wrenched  from  its  office  and 
shifted  550  miles  southeast  to  Kuibyshev.  The  move  very  nearly  wrecked  the 
Swiss  ring.  “On  October  19,”  Foote  wrote,  “Moscow  went  off  the  air  in  the 
middle  of  a message.  Night  after  night  Rado  and  I called,  and  night  after 
night  there  was  no  reply.  Rado  was  in  despair  and  talked  of  going  over  to  the 
British.  . . . Suddenly  one  night  at  the  scheduled  time — and  six  weeks  after  the 
break — the  Centre  piped  up.  As  if  nothing  had  happened,  they  finished 
the  message  that  they  had  cut  off  halfway  through,  a month  and  a half 
before.” 

The  information  that  the  Centre’s  receivers  pulled  in  from  the  Swiss  net- 
work was  valuable  in  the  extreme.  For  Rossler  provided  the  Russian  general 
staff  with  nothing  less  than  the  day-to-day  German  order  of  battle.  This  told 
the  Russians  just  which  forces  were  opposing  them.  How  heavily  they  relied 
on  it  can  be  demonstrated  by  a negative  case  in  which  Lucy’s  information  was 
erroneous  or  falsified  (just  how  this  happened  is  not  known).  It  dealt  with 
troop  dispositions,  and,  the  Director  told  Foote  after  the  war,  it  “cost  us  a 
hundred  thousand  men  at  Kharkov  and  resulted  in  the  Germans  reaching 
Stalingrad.”  Such  total  dependence  suggests  that  many  of  the  Russian  war 
victories  owed  their  success  to  Rossler’s  intelligence.  Foote,  in  fact,  believes 
that  “Moscow  very  largely  fought  the  war  on  Lucy’s  messages.”

As  with  the  Sorge  network  and  the  Rote  Kapelle,  the  cipher  in  which  this 
information  was  encapsulated  could  not  be  broken.  The  Funkabwehr  and  the 
Swiss  police,  the  Bupo,  intercepted  hundreds  of  messages  and  read  none.  The 
Funkabwehr  found  that  the  transmissions  were  coming  from  Switzerland, 
where  it  had  no  power  to  make  arrests,  and  the  Bupo,  which  did  have  the 
power,  at  first  was  disinclined  to  do  so  in  the  case  of  an  anti-Nazi  group.  For 
more  than  a year  they  left  the  ring  alone,  but  German  pressure  finally  com- 
pelled them  to  act.  In  October,  1943,  two  of  the  Swiss  transmitters  were  raided 
by  the  Bupo,  and  at  1:15  a.m.  on  November  20,  as  Foote  was  taking  down  a 
long  message  from  Moscow,  “there  was  a splintering  crash  and  my  room  was 
filled  with  police.  ...  I was  arrested  and  the  last  link  between  the  Centre  and 
Switzerland  was  broken.”  But  its  work  was  completed.  Though  another  year 
and  a half  was  to  elapse  before  Germany  surrendered,  the  issue  was  no  longer 
in  doubt;  in  the  future  shone  the  ultimate  victory. 

Russia’s  wartime  allies  had  never  ceased  to  be  her  espionage  targets,  and 
peace  enabled  her  to  concentrate  on  them  again.  Soviet  espionage  scored  most 
spectacularly  with  the  atomic  spies  Klaus  Fuchs  and  Allan  Nunn  May,  but  it 
did  not  neglect  lesser  fry.  As  the  Iron  Curtain  clanged  down  and  the  Cold 
War  grew  gelid,  secret  agents  were  planted  here  and  there  throughout  the 
free  and  uncommitted  worlds.  The  Soviet  spy  net  covered  the  globe.  To 
direct  it,  to  protect  it,  and  to  harvest  its  catch,  an  elaborate  system  of  secret 
communications  was  required.  Often  the  node  of  a spy  ring  was  the  Russian 
embassy,  and  here  security  began  with  physical  safeguards. 

In  Canada,  the  cryptographic  keys  used  by  cipher  clerk  Igor  Gouzenko 
were  kept  in  a sealed  bag  that  was  placed  each  night  inside  a steel  safe  that 
was  within  an  eight-room  suite,  closed  by  double  steel  doors  and  with  iron 
bars  and  steel  shutters  on  the  white-opaqued  windows,  that  was  on  the  second 
floor  of  a separate  wing  of  the  brick  embassy  building,  which  was  surrounded 
by  a fence.  In  Australia,  where  Vladimir  Petrov  handled  the  espionage  crypto- 
graphy, the  key  to  the  safe  in  which  his  cipher  documents  were  stored  was 
kept  in  an  envelope  sealed  with  wax  and  a signet  and  locked  inside  the  general 
embassy  safe.  The  cipher  suite  here  consisted  of  four  rooms,  two  outer  ones, 
which  served  for  general  embassy  purposes,  and  two  inner  sanctums,  a kind 
of  holy  of  holies,  in  which  the  clerks  enciphered  the  espionage  messages.  In 
the  desk  of  the  chief  cipher  clerk  in  an  outer  room,  Petrov  saw  four  revolvers 
in  a drawer.  Both  embassies  had  stoves  in  which  to  burn  cryptographic  work- 
sheets and  other  secret  documents.  In  the  1960s,  the  Washington  embassy 
kept  chemicals  at  hand  that  could  eat  through  a thick  stack  of  paper  in  seconds ; 
in  an  emergency,  this  is  much  faster  than  trying  to  stuff  wads  into  the  in- 
cinerator. Just  how  seriously  the  Russians  take  their  security  is  illustrated  by 
the  fact  that  on  New  Year's  Day,  1956,  they  preferred  to  let  flames  gut  the 
embassy  in  Ottawa  rather  than  admit  Canadian  firemen  to  the  grounds  and, 
officials  said,  risk  foreigners’  seeing  their  codes  and  ciphers.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


For  transmission,  documents  are  photographed  and  the  films — un- 
developed, so  that  a thief’s  illegitimate  opening  of  them  in  the  light  would 
ruin  them — sent  in  the  diplomatic  pouch.  This  procedure  is  followed  for 
messages  both  to  and  from  the  embassy.  When  the  35-millimeter  film  arrives 
from  Moscow,  clerks  develop  it,  make  a single  enlarged  print  from  each 
frame,  and  destroy  the  negative.  When  Moscow  acknowledges  receipt  of  an 
embassy  film,  the  embassy  burns  the  original  documents.  The  film  for  the 
secret  police  may  come  in  a packet  marked  P.M.V.,  the  initial  letters  of  the 
Russian  office  of  weights  and  measures.  Late  in  the  1950s,  the  Russians  began 
taking  the  precaution  of  using  a locked  container  that  automatically  spilled 
acid  onto  the  undeveloped  film  if  anyone  tampered  with  it.  New  cipher  keys 
are  sent  by  diplomatic  bag;  they  are  in  an  envelope,  addressed  to  the  secret 
police  official,  which  is  sealed  inside  an  outer  envelope  addressed  to  the 
ambassador  himself. 

Those  keys  are  one-time  pads — in  the  old-fashioned  manual  form. 
Although  the  several  branches  of  a Soviet  mission — diplomatic,  secret  police, 
military,  commercial,  and  political  (Communist  party) — all  have  their  own 
keys  and  (in  the  larger  embassies)  cipher  clerks,  all  probably  use  this  system. 
All  cables  coming  into  the  legation  look  alike:  simple  groups  of  five  digits. 
The  chief  cipher  clerk  applies  a key  to  the  last  group;  it  might  decipher  out  as 
66666,  which  on  one  day  might  mean  that  the  message  belonged  to  G.R.U., 
another  day,  K.G.B.,  another  day,  the  trade  section. 

The  one-time  pads  also  play  a role  in  the  photographed  letters.  These  are 
composed  in  plain  Russian  using  the  semisecret  jargon  of  espionage — 
packing  to  mean  ciphering,  open  packing  to  mean  plaintext,  bank  for  hiding 
place.  In  addition,  specifically  assigned  codenames  are  used  to  cover  real 
identities.  For  example,  in  Canada,  Colonel  Zabotin,  the  military  attache, 
was  grant,  and  alek  stood  for  Allan  Nunn  May.  (How  successfully  such 
codenames  work  may  be  seen  in  Canada’s  Report  of  the  Royal  Commission 
on  the  Soviet  spy  ring,  in  which  the  commissioners  conceded  that  “we  have 
been  unable  to  identify  the  following  persons  named  under  ‘cover-names’  in 
the  documents  and  there  definitely  stated  to  have  been  members  of  Zabotin’s 
ring:  galya,  gini,  golia,  green,  surensen.”)  After  codenames  have  been 
inserted,  a code  clerk  copies  the  document,  removing  all  sensitive  terms  and 
replacing  the  first  with  “No.  1,”  the  second  with  “No.  2,”  and  so  on.  The 
letter  is  photographed  in  this  form.  The  terms  themselves,  with  their  numerical 
equivalents,  are  enciphered  by  the  one-time  pads.  The  numerical  ciphertext 
is  enclosed  with  the  films  in  the  diplomatic  pouch  on  an  ordinary  sheet  of 
paper. 

Thus,  when  Vladimir  Petrov  developed  a filmed  letter  from  Moscow  dated 
25  November  1952,  he  found,  in  part: 

We  request  you  to  report  to  us  by  the  next  luggage  all  the  information 
known  to  you  concerning  No.  42,  who  figures  in  the  departmental  files  in  con- 
nection with  her  No.  43,  and  about  her  No.  44  in  Sparta.  . . . 


PyccKan  Kpunmonozun  663 

Depending  on  the  availability  of  full  particulars  concerning  No.  42  and  her 
No.  44  in  Sparta,  we  shall  weigh  the  question  of  No.  45  to  Sudania  one  of  our 
planners  along  No.  46  Novators,  under  the  guise  No.  44  of  No.  42 

Petrov  knew  that  luggage  meant  mail,  departmental,  consular,  and 
planner,  cadre  worker  in  the  espionage  jargon.  He  consulted  a list  of  formal 
codenames  and  found  that  sparta  meant  Russia,  sudania,  Australia,  and 
novators,  secret  agents.  Decipherment  of  the  accompanying  sheet  of  paper 
told  Petrov  that,  in  this  letter,  “No.  42— Kazanova;  No.  43— last  will  and 
testament;  No.  44 — relatives;  No.  45 — sending;  No.  46 — lines.  . . .”  Thus, 
interpreted,  decoded,  and  with  the  deciphered  equivalents  of  the  numbers 
inserted,  the  paragraphs  read: 

We  request  you  to  report  to  us  by  the  next  mail  all  the  information  known 
to  you  concerning  Kazanova  [an  old  Russian  woman  living  in  Sydney],  who 
figures  in  the  consular  files  in  connection  with  her  last  will  and  testament  and 
about  her  relatives  in  Russia  [whom  she  wanted  to  see],  . . . 

Depending  on  the  availability  of  full  particulars  concerning  Kazanova  and 
her  relatives  in  Russia,  we  shall  weigh  the  question  of  sending  to  Australia  one 
of  our  cadre  workers  along  the  lines  of  a secret  agent,  under  the  guise  of  a rela- 
tive of  Kazanova. 

This  system  appears  to  be  used  instead  of  total  encipherment  because 
security  has  bowed  to  convenience.  To  encipher  everything  fully  would  take 
too  long.  Perhaps  one  reason  is  that  the  cipher  clerks  have  to  work  by  hand. 

For  its  agents  in  the  field,  however,  the  Soviet  Union  uses  the  best.  It  takes 
no  chances,  cryptologically  speaking,  with  them  or  their  networks.  It  gives  its 
agents  the  confidence  that  they  need  fear  nothing  from  cryptanalysis.  It  will 
not  jeopardize  their  radio  links  with  Moscow  by  trusting  to  anything  less  than 
the  one  perfectly  secure  system  of  encipherment.  The  main  Soviet  spy  cipher 
today  employs  the  one-time  pad. 

Its  form  varies.  It  has  been  found  as  a thick,  squarish  booklet  the  size  of  a 
postage  stamp  and  as  a scroll  about  the  size  of  a cigarette  butt.  It  seems  to  be 
growing  smaller.  A pad  captured  in  1954  had  40  rows  of  eight  five-digit 
groups.  One  captured  in  1958  had  30  rows  of  ten.  Pads  captured  in  1957  and 
1961  had  20  rows  of  four  and  five  groups,  respectively.  Columns,  rows,  and 
pages  are  numbered.  One  booklet  had  250  pages  of  a material  like  very  thin 
gold  and  silver  foil  (several  scrolls  are  needed  to  provide  an  equivalent  supply 
of  key  digits).  Usually,  one  part  of  the  pad  is  printed  in  red  and  the  other  in 
black,  presumably  to  distinguish  the  enciphering  keys  from  the  deciphering. 
The  “printing”  seems  to  be  simple  photography— probably  the  best  way  to 
make  the  one  accurate  copy  of  the  original  key  that  the  agent  will  need;  extra 
evidence  for  this  is  that  the  Russian  word  gamma  (“scale”),  which  appears 
to  be  the  Soviet  term  for  one-time  pad,  is  used  in  photography.  Furthermore, 
the  “paper”  of  the  pad  is  cellulose  nitrate,  which  was  used  for  film  in  the  early 
days  of  the  motion-picture  industry.  It  is  highly  inflammable,  and  spies  seem 


664 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


to  have  kept  potassium  permanganate  at  hand  to  turn  an  ordinary  combustion 
into  an  almost  explosive  reaction  to  destroy  the  pads  rapidly  and  completely. 
No  latent  image  would  remain. 

Interestingly,  some  pads  seem  to  be  produced  by  typists  and  not  by 
machines.  They  show  strike-overs  and  erasures — neither  likely  to  be  made  by 
machines.  More  significant  are  statistical  analyses  of  the  digits.  One  such  pad, 
for  example,  has  seven  times  as  many  groups  in  which  digits  in  the  l-to-5 
group  alternate  with  digits  in  the  6-to-0  group,  like  18293,  as  a purely  random 
arrangement  would  have.  This  suggests  that  the  typist  is  striking  alternately 
with  her  left  hand  (which  would  type  the  l-to-5  group  on  a Continental 
machine)  and  her  right  (which  would  type  the  6-to-0  group).  Again,  instead 
of  just  half  the  groups  beginning  with  a low  number,  which  would  be  ex- 
pected in  a random  selection,  three  quarters  of  them  do,  possibly  because  the 
typist  is  spacing  with  her  right  hand,  then  starting  a new  group  with  her  left. 
Fewer  doubles  and  triples  appear  than  chance  expects.  Possibly  the  girls, 
ordered  to  type  at  random,  sensed  that  some  doublets  and  triplets  would 
occur  in  a random  text  but,  misled  by  their  conspicuousness,  minimized  them. 
Despite  these  anomalies,  however,  the  digits  still  show  far  too  little  pattern 
to  make  cryptanalysis  possible. 

One-time  pads  have  turned  up  with  a number  of  top  Soviet  spies.  Rudolf 
Abel,  the  highest-ranking  Russian  agent  ever  captured  in  the  United  States, 
had  the  one  in  the  form  of  a booklet  and  the  size  of  a postage  stamp — 
ljjx|  xl  inches.  F.B.I.  agents  found  it  when  they  arrested  him  in  his  room 
in  New  York’s  Hotel  Latham  on  June  21,  1957.  Abel  had  wrapped  it  in 
paper  and  concealed  it  inside  a hollowed-out  block  of  wood  covered  with 
sandpaper  like  a sanding  block  (Abel  posed  as  an  artist)  that  he  had  tossed 
casually  into  the  wastebasket.  A Greek  Communist,  Gregory  Liolios,  had  a 
one-time  pad  when  he  was  arrested  in  1954,  as  did  another,  Eleftherious 
Voutsas,  picked  up  in  1958.  In  suburban  London,  early  in  1961,  half  a dozen 
one-time  pads  in  the  scroll  form  were  found  hidden  in  the  base  of  a Ronson 
cigarette  lighter  in  the  cottage  of  Helen  and  Peter  Kroger,  two  Soviet  spies 
who  were  actually  two  Americans  named  Lona  and  Morris  Cohen.  More  pads 
were  found  in  another  lighter  in  the  London  flat  of  their  chief,  the  Soviet 
Resident  (agent  in  charge)  for  England,  known  only  by  his  alias,  Gordon 
Arnold  Lonsdale.  Later  that  year,  Japanese  police  rounded  up  members  of  a 
North  Korean  Communist  spy  ring,  and  found  among  their  effects  some  one- 
time pads.  Atomic  scientist  Giuseppe  Martelli,  accused  of  espionage  against 
Britain  for  the  Soviet  Union,  was  carrying  two  tiny  packs  of  pads  in  a pack 
of  cigarettes  when  he  was  apprehended  at  Southend  Airport  in  1963.  Seven 
cigarettes  were  intact,  but  six  others  were  glued  together  and  partly  cut  away 
to  form  a recess  for  the  pads.  And  a former  spy  for  East  Germany,  who 
received  his  messages  in  an  open  broadcast  of  numerical  codegroups  and  sent 
them  by  leaving  them  in  a tin  box  hidden  under  a tree  root,  also  enciphered 
with  the  one-time  pad.

Messages  so  enciphered  appear  to  have  been  radioed  to  Moscow.  Abel 
had  a shortwave  set  in  his  Brooklyn  studio  and  a receiver  in  his  hotel  room. 
He  told  his  lieutenant  that  he  tape-recorded  incoming  messages,  then  took 
them  down  on  paper  and  deciphered  them.  After  his  arrest,  U.S.  government 
agents  listened  in  accordance  with  a broadcast  schedule  found  in  the  tip  of  a 
hollowed-out  pencil,  also  thrown  into  Abel’s  wastebasket,  and  twice  picked 
up  messages  in  five-digit  groups.  British  security  police  found  a signal  plan 
with  the  one-time  pads  in  the  Krogers’  lighter.  They  likewise  listened  in 
accordance  with  its  instructions.  At  12:32  a.m.  January  9,  1961,  tuned  to 
17,080  kilocycles,  they  heard  the  call-sign  dash  dot  dot.  Eighteen  minutes  later

they  heard  the  same  sign  at  14,755  kilocycles.  On  January  18,  at  6:38  a.m. 
at  6,340  kilocycles,  they  heard  call-sign  277.  Less  than  an  hour  later,  they 
heard  it  again  at  8,888  kilocycles.  Direction-finders  plotted  the  source  of  the 
signals  as  the  Moscow  area.  Lonsdale  had  a high-speed  transmission  device 
that  would  send  Morse  at  240  words  per  minute;  probably  it  recorded  his 
message  and  then  spewed  it  out  in  a spurt. 

Communication  seems  to  be  fairly  frequent.  The  Kroger  signal  plan  pro- 
vided for  contact  Tuesdays,  Wednesdays,  Fridays,  and  Saturdays.  This  fre- 
quency may  explain  why  both  Abel  and  Mrs.  Kroger  had  enciphered  messages 
on  them  when  they  were  caught.  Abel  tried  to  stuff  his  up  a sleeve.  Mrs. 
Kroger  asked  to  be  allowed  to  stoke  the  furnace  before  leaving  the  house  for 
a long  period  of  questioning,  but  when  an  envelope  containing  a single  sheet 
of  paper  with  a block  of  typed  numbers  was  removed  from  her  handbag,  “Mrs. 


666  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Kroger,”  a security  officer  said,  “showed  no  further  desire  to  stoke  the 
boiler.” 

Radio  was  supplemented  by  microdots.  Lonsdale  hid  a microdot  reader 
in  a can  of  talcum  powder.  Abel  made  his  own  microdots  by  reducing  the  35- 
millimeter  negative  with  a lens  having  a very  short  focal  length.  To  preserve 
legibility  in  these  great  reductions,  he  used  spectroscopic  film,  which  is 
available  at  many  camera  stores  and  which  can  resolve  1,000  lines  per  milli- 
meter. He  undid  the  stapling  of  Better  Homes  & Gardens  and  American  Home, 
inserted  the  thin  strips  of  microdots  between  sections,  rebound  the  magazines, 
and  mailed  them  off  to  a prearranged  general  delivery  number  in  Paris.  For 
some  reason  the  hidden  messages  were  not  received  and  Moscow  told  Abel 
to  discontinue  them.  However,  microdots  brought  the  spies  plaintext  letters 
from  home. 

Though  the  one-time  pad  is  the  standard  method  for  radio  communication 
between  top  agents  and  Moscow,  other  systems  serve  the  internal  needs  of 
secret  communications  within  Communist  spy  rings.  The  rule  here  seems  to 
be  that  where  Russians  have  devised  the  systems,  they  are  top-notch,  and 
where  local  Communists  who  are  natives  of  a country  have  done  so,  they  can 
be  solved — often  with  disastrous  effect.  In  1955,  for  example,  Swedish  coun- 
terespionage police  noticed  that  a chauffeur  at  the  Czech  legation  went  to  the 
Stockholm  railroad  station  each  night  to  buy  copies  of  the  newspapers 
Kurier  and  Tidning,  both  published  in  the  provincial  city  of  Karlskoga,  where 
munitions  are  manufactured.  Studying  the  papers,  police  noticed  a number 
of  oddly  worded  announcements.  When  they  inserted  similar  advertisements, 
using  the  same  identifying  words,  they  received  responses  from  several  people 
who  turned  out  to  be  Red  agents.  Eventually  a ring  that  operated  in  five 
cities  was  broken  up  and  four  Communist  satellite  diplomats  declared 
persona  non  grata. 

The  most  catastrophic  instance  of  the  eggshell  ciphers  of  local  Communists 
took  place  in  Iran.  On  the  night  of  August  16,  1954,  Iranian  security  police 
arrested  Ali  Abbasi,  a former  Army  captain  who  had  come  under  suspicion 
because  of  his  activities  in  the  Red  Tudeh  party.  In  the  suitcase  he  was  carrying 
as  he  came  out  of  a house  in  Teheran,  they  found  a complete  plan  of  Shah 
Mohammed  Reza  Pahlevi’s  summer  palace,  showing  guard  posts  and  the 
number  of  men  stationed  at  each,  top-secret  documents  from  Army  files,  re- 
ports on  the  disposition  of  artillery  along  Iran’s  Russian  border,  two  note- 
books in  what  were  obviously  cipher,  and  another  with  page  after  page  of 
what  appeared  to  be  trigonometric  equations,  replete  with  the  Greek  letters 
beloved  of  mathematicians  and  the  abbreviations  for  “secant,”  “cosine,” 
“tangent,”  and  “cotangent.”  The  problem  was  that  mathematically  the 
formulas  made  no  sense  at  all. 

Colonel  Mostafa  Amjadi,  chief  of  the  intelligence  directorate  of  the 
Teheran  military  governate,  and  another  colonel  in  the  Iranian  Army  went 
to  work  on  the  three  notebooks.  By  August  30,  they  had  cracked  the  two 


PyccKan  KpunmoAozun  667 

overt  codes,  but  extracted  only  meager  information  from  them.  Meanwhile, 
Abbasi  decided  to  talk.  He  revealed  that  the  Tudeh  party  had  riddled  the 
Iranian  Army  with  about  400  agents  and  that  their  names  were  listed  in  a 
mathematical  cipher.  This  was  the  trigonometric  system  which  Amjadi  and 
his  colleague  were  even  then  struggling  with,  but  Abbasi  warned  that  the 
system  was  so  complex  that  it  could  be  read  only  by  its  inventor,  Lieutenant 
Colonel  Jamsheed  Mobasheri,  an  artillery  officer  regarded  by  his  friends  as 
something  of  a mathematical  genius.

The  imitation  “ trigonometric ” cipher  of  Red  agents  in  Iran 

Mobasheri  was  picked  up  for  questioning.  Instead  of  revealing  the  key,  he 
tried  to  puncture  a vein  with  a rusty  nail.  The  two  colonel-cryptanalysts 
worked  steadily  24  hours  a day  in  overlapping  shifts  of  12  hours  each. 
Mobasheri  was  again  interrogated,  and,  now  that  the  first  shock  of  arrest 
had  worn  off,  his  pride  of  authorship  in  his  cipher  almost  overcame  his  loyalty 
to  Communism  and  he  twice  agreed  to  reveal  the  method — only  to  change 
his  mind  both  times.  The  Iranian  government  quietly  asked  other  countries  if 
they  would  help  in  the  solution.  Meanwhile,  one  of  the  colonels  formulated  a 
theory  as  to  Mobasheri's  system  and  interviewed  him,  hoping  to  get  some 
clues  from  the  inventor’s  reactions.  Mobasheri  stubbornly  insisted  that  the 
system  could  not  be  broken,  but  just  as  the  colonel  was  leaving  the  cell 
Mobasheri’s  appreciation  for  an  intelligent  analysis  broke  through,  and  he 


668 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


admitted  that  the  cryptanalyst  was  on  the  right  track.  On  September  3,  as  an 
airplane  was  about  to  fly  copies  of  the  trigonometric  notebook  to  an  ally’s 
cryptanalysts,  the  two  haggard  colonels  cracked  Mobasheri’s  cipher. 

The  roster  proved  to  be  as  detailed  as  an  official  army  register  in  describing 
the  officers,  making  identification  easy.  But  it  was  so  extensive  that  it  took 
several  days  to  decrypt  it  and  locate  the  conspirators.  A week  later  all  400  were 
arrested.  This  enormous  conspiracy,  Iranian  security  police  discovered,  had 
not  only  obtained  detailed  information  on  the  strength  and  disposition  of 
Iran's  entire  armed  forces,  but  had  wormed  into  vital  posts  that  would  have 
enabled  it  to  assassinate  on  a moment’s  notice  members  of  the  government 
from  the  Shah  on  down.  It  was  ready  either  to  pull  a coup  and  set  up  its  own 
Communist  puppet  government  or  to  deliver  the  nation  entire  to  the  Soviet 
Union.  Imperfect  ciphers  kept  it  from  doing  either.  Instead,  26  of  its  leaders 
— including  Mobasheri — were  executed,  and  hundreds  of  run-of-the-mill 
plotters  and  sympathizers  were  jailed.  A poisonous  infection  had  been  cleaned 
out;  a year  later  Iran  abandoned  her  traditional  neutrality  and,  signing  the 
Baghdad  Pact,  aligned  herself  with  the  West. 

No  cryptographic  weakness  imperils  the  operation  of  Russian  spy  rings. 
Perhaps  the  most  striking  example  lies  in  the  cipher  used  by  Abel's  lieutenant, 
Reino  Hayhanen.  For  two  years  after  the  fat,  lazy,  and  irresponsible  Hayhanen 
landed  in  New  York,  he  did  not  meet  Abel  in  person,  but  communicated  with 
him  by  messages  hidden  in  prearranged  “drops” — a crack  in  the  cement  wall 
that  runs  from  165th  to  167th  streets  along  Jerome  Avenue  in  the  Bronx, 
behind  a loose  brick  under  a bridge  in  Central  Park,  under  lampposts  in 
Prospect  and  Fort  Tryon  parks.  The  messages  were  on  “soft”  microfilm, 
which  Abel  made  by  dissolving  the  stiff  film  base;  this  left  only  the  soft, 
image-bearing  emulsion,  which  could  be  squeezed  into  tiny  places.  Abel  and 
the  couriers  from  Moscow  used  hollowed-out  pencils,  bolts,  flashlight  bat- 
teries, and  coins  as  message-containers  in  his  drops  because  they  would  be 
less  likely  to  arouse  suspicion  if  found  by  accident.  A horizontal  mark  with 
blue  chalk  at  various  signal  areas — park  fences  or  subway  stations — meant 
that  a message  had  been  placed  in  a drop,  a vertical  mark  that  it  had  been 
retrieved.  These  were  to  be  checked  daily.  Soon  after  Hayhanen’s  arrival  on 
October  21,  1952,  he  “posted”  his  first  message.  Moscow  responded  with  an 
enciphered  message  on  soft  microfilm  enclosed  in  a hollow  1948  Jefferson 
nickel.  It  read:

Somehow  the  hollow  nickel  went  astray.  Most  probably  Flayhanen,  who 
was  sloppy  in  his  spy  work,  spent  it.  It  circulated  in  the  economy  like  millions 
of  its  fellows,  with  none  of  those  who  passed  it  from  hand  to  hand  aware  of  its 
secret  cargo.  Then  one  hot  morning  in  the  summer  of  1953,  newsboy  James 
Bozart,  who  had  just  received  it  as  part  of  50  cents  in  change  from  a customer 
on  his  route  at  3403  Foster  Avenue  in  Brooklyn,  dropped  it  with  four  other 
nickels  and  a quarter  on  the  staircase.  When  he  bent  over  to  pick  it  up,  he 
found  that  it  had  split  in  half.  One  of  the  hollowed-out  halves  held  a piece  of 
microfilm  five-sixteenths  of  an  inch  square,  wrapped  in  tissue  paper.  “It  was 
a picture  of  a file  card,  or  an  index  card,”  Bozart  said.  “There  appeared  to  be 
a row  of  numbers  on  it.”  He  turned  it  over  to  police,  who  gave  it  to  the  F.B.I., 
who  must  have  immediately  begun  trying  to  crack  it.  They  failed. 

Four  years  later,  Reino  Hayhanen  defected  to  the  U.S.  embassy  in  Paris 
as  he  was  being  sent  back  to  the  Soviet  Union  by  the  dissatisfied  Abel  for  a 
“vacation.”  He  disclosed  the  cipher  system  and  the  keys  that  he  had  used,  and 
in  the  summer  of  1957,  F.B.I.  Russian  expert  Michael  G.  Leonard  applied 
them  to  the  207  five-figure  groups  of  the  microfilm  that  Bozart  had  found.  At 
last  the  F.B.I.  was  able  to  read  the  nickel  message. 

Encipherment  began  with  bisection:  cutting  the  plaintext  in  half  and  put- 
ting the  second  part  first,  thus  burying  the  vulnerable  beginning  (which  was 
marked  by  a special  indicator)  deep  within  the  body  of  the  message.  There 
followed  a substitution  by  straddling  checkerboard,  based,  in  this  case,  on  the 
first  seven  letters  of  the  Russian  word  SNEGOPAD  (“snowfall”).  It  was  in- 
scribed in  the  top  line — there  was  no  Russian  equivalent  of  ASINTOER, 
though  the  seven  letters  snegopa  include  the  most  frequent  in  Russian  (o, 
at  1 1 per  cent)  and  total  to  40  per  cent  of  normal  Russian  text.  The  rest  of  the 
Cyrillic  alphabet  and  additional  symbols  followed  below.  This  preliminary 
ciphertext  was  written  horizontally  into  a columnar  transposition  block.  It 
was  transcribed  vertically  and  written  horizontally  into  a second  transposition 
block.  This  one,  however,  had  a series  of  steplike  disruption,  or  D,  areas.  The 
first  D area  began  in  the  top  row  under  keynumber  1 and  ran  to  the  right  side 
of  that  row.  In  succeeding  rows  it  began  one  column  to  the  right.  When  after 
several  rows  the  starting  point  reached  the  right  side  of  the  block,  a row  was 
skipped  and  the  second  D area  began  under  keynumber  2.  It  was  constructed 
like  its  predecessor.  Other  D areas  followed.  The  cipher  digits  being  written 
into  the  second  transposition  block  went  first  into  the  non-D  area,  and  when 
this  was  filled  the  inscription  continued  in  the  steplike  D areas.  The  final

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


ciphertext  was  obtained  by  vertical  transcription  in  keynumber  order  from 
this  second  block,  in  which  transcription  the  D areas  were  disregarded. 

The  system  dispensed  with  written  keys  such  as  Abel’s  one-time  pad,  which 
helped  incriminate  him.  Hayhanen  had  to  remember  only  four  basic  keys — 
SNEGOPA(D),  the  first  20  letters  of  a Russian  popular  song  (“The  Lone 
Accordion”),  the  date  of  the  World  War  II  victory  over  Japan  (3/9/1945,  in  the 
Continental  style),  and  his  personal  keynumber  (13,  changed  to  20  in  1956). 
The  latter  three  keys  generated  the  keys  for  the  transpositions  and  the  coordin- 
ates of  the  checkerboard  through  a process  that  was  extremely  complicated 
but  that  possessed  a kind  of  tractive  logic,  was  meant  to  be  memorized,  and 
probably  would  be  after  two  or  three  run-throughs. 

This  process  injected  an  arbitrary  five-digit  number  at  the  very  beginning 
of  the  key  derivation,  strongly  influencing  the  end  result.  (This  number  was 
also  inserted  in  a predetermined  position  in  the  cryptogram  so  that  the 
decipherer  would  have  it.  In  Hayhanen’s  case,  this  position  was  the  fifth 
group  from  the  end,  the  position  coming  from  the  last  figure,  5,  of  the  victory 
date.)  This  group  changed  from  message  to  message,  so  the  enciphering  keys, 
and  consequently  the  ciphertexts  of  all  messages  enciphered  in  this  system, 
would  bear  no  exploitable  relation  to  one  another.  Not  only  would  the  trans- 
position keys  differ,  the  very  widths  of  the  blocks  would  as  well — this  being 
a variable  stemming  from  the  key  derivation.  This  kills  any  last  hope  of  an 
analysis  by  comparing  messages.  The  poor  cryptanalyst  would  even  be  denied 
the  consolation  of  discovering  a common  origin  of  the  cryptograms  through 
similarities  in  frequency  counts,  for  the  coordinates  themselves  would  change. 
Any  solution  would  thus  have  to  be  effected  on  the  basis  of  a single  message. 
It  would  require  trying  every  sensible  pattern  of  transposition  until  one  was 
found  that  yielded  a monalphabetic  frequency  count  of  the  digits.  The  D 
areas  significantly  increase  the  difficulty  of  finding  this  pattern,  just  as  the 
straddling  effect  increases  the  difficulty  of  getting  a valid  frequency  count. 
The  number  of  trials  for  a 1,035-digit  message  like  the  nickel  one  is  astronom- 
ical, and,  even  with  computers,  it  would  probably  take  years.  In  theory  the 
system  is  not  unbreakable,  but  in  practice  it  is.  Its  security  could  not  have 
been  more  pointedly  demonstrated  than  by  the  F.B.I.’s  failure  to  solve  it. 

Such  is  the  cryptology  of  the  Soviet  Union.  It  is  interesting  to  contemplate 
its  excellence.  Russia  herself  remains  “a  riddle  wrapped  in  a mystery  inside  an 
enigma.”  So,  when  she  decrees  it,  do  her  communications.  The  one-time  pad 
ensures  this  for  the  bulk  of  her  spy  messages  and  for  a fair  proportion  of  her 
diplomatic  and  secret-police  messages.  Complex  rotor-type  cipher  machines, 
well-designed  in  themselves  and  handled  with  a sophistication  that  changes 
keys  after  foreign  cryptanalysts  have  reconstructed  part  of  the  wiring  and 
the  rotation  pattern  but  before  they  can  read  any  plaintext,  guard  other  high- 
level  diplomatic  and  military  messages  of  Soviet  Russia.  And  even  when  she 
requires  a cipher  to  be  fully  mnemonic,  like  Hayhanen’s,  she  designs  it  so  that 


PyccKan  KpunmoAoeun  67 1 

it  cannot  be  broken.  She  has  solved,  during  the  Cold  War,  ciphers  in  use  at 
the  American  embassy  in  Moscow.  Feats  like  these  bear  witness  to  know- 
ledge that  could  only  well  up  from  a profound  understanding  of  cryptography 
and  cryptanalysis.  Whether  this  comprehension  springs  from  the  scientific 
ability  that  has  enabled  Russia  to  orbit  great  artificial  satellites,  or  from  the 
decades-long  experience  of  cryptology  that  the  Communist  dictators  have 
had  to  practice  for  self-preservation  and  aggrandizement,  or  from  the  habits 
of  secrecy  and  puzzling  out  the  real  meaning  of  things  that  are  ingrained  into 
every  inhabitant  of  a totalitarian  society,  or  from  a dark-souled  Slavic  love 
of  the  mysterious,  it  has  beyond  question  rocketed  Red  accomplishments  in 
this  black  art  to  Sputnik  height.

it  has  been  said  that  90  per  cent  of  all  the  scientists  who  have  ever  lived 
are  living  today.  The  remark  applies  to  cryptology  with  even  greater  force. 
The  age  is  one  of  communications  and  of  Cold  War.  The  titans  that  confront 
one  another  in  Berlin  and  Vietnam  and  outer  space  owe  much  of  their  effec- 
tiveness as  superpowers  to  the  vast  webs  of  communications  through  which 
they  receive  information  and  transmit  commands.  These  networks,  more 
extensive  and  more  heavily  used  than  any  in  history,  furnish  cryptologists  with 
unparalleled  opportunities.  The  Cold  War  gives  them  the  impetus  to  exploit 
these  opportunities — a stimulus  that,  in  view  of  the  dangers  of  national  ex- 
tinction, becomes  almost  an  imperative.  These  two  factors  converge  to  pro- 
duce more  cryptology  and  more  cryptologists  than  ever  before. 

The  size  and  magnitude  of  modern  communications  are  staggering.  The 
Defense  Communications  System,  a worldwide  strategic  network  of  the 
American  armed  forces,  transmits  well  over  a quarter  of  a million  messages 
a day,  or  more  than  10,000  messages  every  hour.  Its  10,000,000-plus  channel 
miles — enough  to  circle  the  globe  400  times — are  distributed  among  85  sub- 
ordinate nets  that  provide  25,000  channels  and  pass  through  200  relay  stations 
and  more  than  1,500  tributary  stations.  Its  plant  is  worth  $2.5  billion  and  it 
costs  nearly  three  quarters  of  a million  dollars  a year  to  run.  Operating  it  are 
more  than  30,000  soldiers,  sailors,  and  airmen.  The  D.C.S.  consists  essentially 
of  the  strategic  nets  of  the  three  service  branches — the  Army’s  starcom,  or 
Strategic  Army  Network,  the  Navy’s  Naval  Communications  System,  and 
the  Air  Force’s  aircom,  or  U.S.A.F.  Communications  Complex — all  welded 
into  a compatible  whole.  The  D.C.S.  does  not  include  the  tactical,  ship-shore, 
or  air-ground  facilities,  all  of  which  add  to  the  communications  volume.  So 
heavy  can  the  tactical  volume  become  that  the  Navy  has  outfitted  ships 
purely  as  communications  vessels.  The  converted  escort  carrier  Annapolis 
put  to  sea  in  the  spring  of  1964  with  its  cavernous  aircraft  storage  space  filled 
with  a mass  of  radios,  teletypewriters,  and  cipher  machines.  The  Army  talks 
over  featherweight  walkie-talkies  and  tiny  helmet  radios  and  observes  the 
battlefield  from  rear  command  posts  via  portable  field  television  sets. 

But  a few  statistics,  however  overwhelming,  and  a few  devices,  however 
striking,  cannot  truly  convey  the  volume,  the  variety,  and  the  importance  of

N.S.A.

communications  in  military  affairs  today.  It  can  sink  in  only  by  enumerating 
one  by  one  the  at  first  interesting,  then  surprising,  and  finally  numbing  list  of 
the  various  networks  that  a military  force  needs  to  send  its  many  kinds  of 
messages.  Take,  in  this  regard,  the  Air  Force. 

Its  basic  network  for  passing  official  traffic  on  a global  basis  is  the  radio 
and  wire  teletype  aircomnet,  which  handles  the  bulk  of  Air  Force  com- 
munications. airopnet,  also  teletype,  provides  communications  among  air 
bases  to  control  worldwide  flight  movement.  The  Air-Ground  Communica- 
tions Network  provides  a voice  link  to  airplanes  from  interconnected  ground 
command  posts  and  air  bases  for  strike  orders  and  traffic  control.  The  Flight 
Service  Network  provides  telephone  service  among  military  and  civilian  air- 
ports for  flight  safety.  U.S.A.F.  Weather  Communications  comprises  the 
Weather  Teletype  Network,  the  Facsimile  Network,  and  the  Global  Weather 
Intercept  and  Broadcast  Network — all  closely  interrelated  to  provide  world- 
wide meteorological  information. 

The  Strategic  Air  Command  alone  employs  six  communications  systems. 
Most  vital  is  the  Primary  Alerting  System,  a wholly  separate  telephone  system 
that  connects  the  command  post  at  Offutt  Air  Force  Base  in  Omaha  directly 
with  all  S.A.C.  control  rooms  and  major  headquarters,  even  those  in  Alaska, 
Spain,  and  the  United  Kingdom.  Its  wires  run  solid  from  the  famous  red 
telephone  at  Offutt  to  loudspeakers  and  handsets  at  all  control  rooms.  Over 
these  circuits  a commander  would  alert  the  major  retaliatory  forces  of  the 
United  States.  Backing  this  up  is  the  all-radio  Commander’s  Net,  for  the 
S.A.C.  chief’s  exclusive  use.  The  Teletype  Net  carries  most  S.A.C.  traffic,  and 
the  Telephone  Net,  part  wire  and  part  radio,  part  commercial  (through 
leases)  and  part  military,  supplements  it.  The  Radio  Telephone  Network, 
within  the  continental  United  States,  provides  an  emergency  reserve  for  the 
Telephone  Net.  The  High-Frequency  Single  Side  Band  Tactical  Air-Ground 
Radio  System  sends  messages  to  attacking  S.A.C.  bombers,  including  fail-safe 
messages. 

The  Tactical  Air  Command  depends  upon  four  networks — the  Operational 
Teletype  Circuits,  Operational  Telephone  Circuits,  Bomb  Damage  Assessment 
Reporting  Circuits,  and  Reserve  Forces  Operational  Telephone  Network — as 
well  as  some  mobile  communications.  The  Air  Defense  Command  relies 
upon  its  Alert  No.  1 Teletype  Network  to  transmit  reports  of  possible 
attacking  airplanes  or  missiles.  It  also  has  a Command  Teletype  Network  and 
a Telephone  Network,  comlognet  transmits  logistic  data  at  high  speed 
directly  from  punched  tabulating  cards.  For  verbal  traffic  concerning  sup- 
plies, the  Air  Materiel  Command  employs  sitecomnet  for  operations, 
amcomnet  for  command  and  administration,  logairnet  for  airlifting  critical 
items,  and  logbalnet  to  supply  ballistic-missile  needs.  Then  the  Military 
Air  Transport  Service  has  three  networks — teletype,  voice,  and  facsimile — 
and  the  U.S.A.F.  Security  Service  enjoys  a network  of  its  own.  In  addition, 
the  several  theaters  have  independent  networks  for  local  traffic,  such  as  the

Alaskan,  Caribbean,  and  Pacific  communications ; the  European-Near  East 
web,  with  its  high  density  of  military  installations  and  integration  with  North 
Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  nations,  is  particularly  complicated.  U.S.  Air 
Force  traffic  flows  over  all  of  these. 

Even  considering  only  the  radio  circuits,  the  possibilities  for  traffic  analysis 
and  cryptanalysis  are  enormous.  The  United  States  protects  itself  from  these, 
and  at  the  same  time  it  exploits  the  opportunities  afforded  by  the  comparable 
Communist  networks.  The  hugeness  of  this  task  has  engendered  the  greatest 
cryptologic  organization  in  history — the  National  Security  Agency  and  the 
three  armed  service  cryptologic  agencies. 

N.S.A.  probably  owes  its  existence,  like  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency 
and  the  Department  of  Defense  itself,  to  Pearl  Harbor.  Congress,  after  its 
investigation  of  the  surprise  attack,  recommended  “that  there  be  a complete 
integration  of  Army  and  Navy  intelligence  agencies,”  and  the  record  of  the 
investigation  contains  a few  anticipatory  suggestions  for  cryptologic  central- 
ization as  well.  Major  General  C.  A.  Willoughby,  MacArthur’s  G-2,  com- 
plaining about  Navy  selection  of  cryptanalyzed  information  passed  over  to 
him,  admonished:  “The  solution  to  this  vexing  and  dangerous  problem  is  a 
completely  joint,  interlocking  intercept  and  cryptoanalytical  service,  on  the 
highest  level,  with  the  freest  interchange  of  messages  and  interpretation.” 
Colonel  Henry  Clausen,  who  investigated  magic  in  1944,  told  the  Joint  Con- 
gressional Committee  the  following  year:  “1  also  think  that  the  basic  recom- 
mendation that  can  come  from  this  committee  is  a very  fine  one  if  you  make 
it  that  never  again  shall  magic,  this  information,  be  monopolized  by  one 
service  or  the  other  service,  but  have  it  distributed  by  one  agency  on  an  overall 
basis.”  Former  Pacific  Fleet  intelligence  officer  Captain  Edwin  Layton  may 
have  had  this  in  mind  when,  after  deploring  the  publicity  given  to  American 
cryptanalysis  by  the  committee  hearings,  added  that  “it  may  serve  a very  fine 
purpose  for  the  future.”  And  in  a memorandum  concerning  a proposed 
Central  Intelligence  Agency  that  Allen  W.  Dulles  submitted  to  the  Senate 
Armed  Services  Committee  in  1947,  the  future  Director  of  Central  Intelligence 
noted  that  “An  important  balance  [to  intelligence  obtained  openly]  must  be 
supplied  by  secret  intelligence  which  includes  what  we  now  often  refer  to  as 
‘Magic,’  ” and  that  any  Central  Intelligence  Agency  should  have  access  to 
“intelligence  gained  through  intercepted  messages,  open  and  deciphered 
alike.” 

In  the  first  postwar  years,  the  cryptologic  duties  of  the  American  armed 
forces  reposed  in  the  separate  agencies  of  the  Army,  the  Navy,  and  the  Air 
Force.  The  Army,  at  least,  charged  its  agency  with  maintaining  “liaison  with 
the  Department  of  the  Navy,  Department  of  the  Air  Force,  and  other  ap- 
propriate agencies,  for  the  purpose  of  coordinating  communication  security 
and  communication  intelligence  equipment  and  procedures.”  Presumably  the 
Navy  and  the  Air  Force  units  were  similarly  charged.  This  arrangement, 


N.S.A. 


675 


which  relied  on  internal  desire  instead  of  external  direction,  prolonged  the 
abuses  hinted  at  by  Willoughby.  To  rectify  them  and  achieve  the  benefits  of 
centralized  control,  the  Defense  Department  in  1949  established  the  Armed 
Forces  Security  Agency.  The  A.F.S.A.  took  over  the  strategic  communica- 
tions-intelligence  functions  and  the  coordination  responsibilities  of  the 
individual  agencies.  It  left  them  with  tactical  communications  intelligence, 
which  can  best  be  performed  near  the  point  of  combat  and  not  at  a central 
location  (except  for  basic  system  solutions),  and  with  low-echelon  communica- 
tions security,  which  differs  radically  in  ground,  sea,  and  air  forces.  Even  in 
these  areas  A.F.S.A.  backed  them  up.  A.F.S.A.  drew  its  personnel  from  the 
separate  departmental  agencies,  though  it  later  hired  separately,  and  housed 
itself  in  their  buildings. 

The  merits  of  the  unified  approach  to  cryptology  quickly  manifested 
themselves.  They  warranted  expanding  that  approach  beyond  the  Defense 
Department  to  all  cryptologic  activities  of  the  United  States  government, 
such  as  State  Department  cryptosystems.  Accordingly,  President  Harry  S 
Truman  promulgated  a directive  that  created  the  National  Security  Agency 
on  November  4,  1952,  abolishing  A.F.S.A.  and  transferring  its  personnel  and 
assets  to  N.S.A. 

That  directive  was  classified  as  security  information,  and  for  several  years 
no  government  document  publicly  acknowledged  the  agency’s  existence. 
Finally,  in  1957,  the  United  States  Government  Organization  Manual  included, 
for  the  first  time,  a brief  but  vague  description.  After  a few  years,  this  was 
changed  slightly  and  settled  into  the  present  three-sentence  stereotype.  The 
first  two  deal  tersely  with  the  agency’s  creation  and  administrative  position: 
“The  National  Security  Agency  was  established  pursuant  to  Presidential 
directive  in  1952.  It  is  an  element  of  the  Department  of  Defense,  and  its 
activities  are  subject  to  the  direction  and  control  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense.” 
A director  of  the  agency  has  said,  in  elaboration,  that  it  is  “within  but  not  a 
part  of  the  Defense  Department,”  which  illuminates  the  scope  of  N.S.A.’s 
activities. 

The  third  sentence,  on  those  activities,  is  a masterpiece  of  saying  nothing 
while  saying  something:  “The  National  Security  Agency  performs  highly 
specialized  technical  and  coordinating  functions  relating  to  the  national 
security.”  The  subject  matter  of  those  functions — which  is  of  course  the  main 
point  of  interest — is  not  specified.  Yet  the  description,  so  far  as  it  goes,  is 
precisely  accurate.  N.S.A.’s  “technical”  functions  basically  consist  of  inter- 
cepting, traffic  analyzing,  and  cryptanalyzing  the  messages  of  all  other 
nations,  friend  as  well  as  foe.  The  “coordinating”  functions  largely  involve 
communications  security — the  creation,  supervision,  and  integration  of 
American  cryptography  to  assure  maximum  security  and  prevent  jeopardizing 
conflicts  among  the  cryptosystems  of  the  three  armed  forces,  the  State 
Department,  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency,  the  F.B.I.,  and  any  other  govern- 
mental bodies  that  may  need  to  communicate  secretly.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


In  its  first  years,  A.F.S.A.-N.S.A.  was  scattered  in  offices  throughout  the 
Washington  area,  notably  at  Arlington  Hall,  home  of  the  Army  Security 
Agency,  though  its  official  address  was  3801  Nebraska  Avenue,  North  West, 
home  of  the  Navy  Branch.  In  1953,  however,  the  Defense  Department  called 
for  bids  on  the  preliminaries  for  constructing  a single  big  building  at  Fort 
George  G.  Meade,  Maryland,  about  half  way  between  Washington  and 
Baltimore.  In  July  of  1954,  the  Charles  H.  Tompkins  Company  of  Washing- 
ton was  awarded  a $19,944,451  contract  to  construct  one  of  the  most  costly 
buildings  in  the  Washington  area  on  an  82-acre  site  in  conjunction  with  the 
J.  A.  Jones  Company.  It  was  essentially  completed  in  the  fall  of  1957,  but  it 
was  not  until  early  in  1958  that  the  last  of  the  employees  had  moved  in.  By 
then  the  total  cost  had  risen  to  about  $35,000,000  for  the  structure,  for  associ- 
ated facilities  such  as  parking  lots,  utility  lines,  electrical  power  substation, 
supply  building,  and  barracks  for  the  Marine  Corps  guards,  and  for  moving 
in  existing  equipment  and  installing  new. 

The  long,  three-story  structure,  of  concrete,  glass,  and  steel,  in  the  shape 
of  a squared-off  A,  stands  in  a shallow  bowl  fringed  with  pine  trees  and  sur- 
rounded by  acres  of  asphalt  parking  lots.  It  faces  south,  fronting  upon  Savage 
Road,  a narrow  road  that  widens  as  it  passes  N.S.A.  and  then  shrinks  again. 
The  Baltimore-Washington  Expressway  runs  a few  hundred  yards  to  the 
west.  This  Operations  Building  is  980  feet  wide  by  560  feet  deep,  and  along  its 
full  width  runs  the  longest  unobstructed  corridor  in  the  country,  an  honor 
previously  claimed  by  the  750-foot  central  corridor  of  the  United  States 
Capitol. 

In  addition  to  dozens  of  offices  and  basement  facilities  for  computers,  the 
structure  encloses  a cafeteria  accommodating  1,400  and  an  auditorium  seating 
500,  eight  snack  bars,  a post  exchange,  a dispensary  with  X-ray  and  operating 
rooms  and  dental  chairs,  a shoe-repair  and  clothes-cleaning  shop,  a barber 
shop,  and  a branch  of  the  State  Bank  of  Laurel.  A system  of  “security  con- 
veyor belts”  runs  through  the  basement,  carrying  trays  of  documents  to  eight 
substations.  A German  pneumatic-tube  system  can  whisk  up  to  800  containers 
an  hour  at  75  feet  per  second  to  interoffice  destinations  selected  by  a dial  at 
each  station.  The  building  is  fully  air-conditioned.  It  has  a public-address 
system.  It  is  said  to  have  more  electric  wiring  than  any  building  in  the  world. 
Its  institutional,  characterless  offices,  filled  with  metal  desks,  partitions,  and 
lockable  file  cabinets,  are  the  black  chambers  of  today. 

But  although  this  cathedral  of  cryptology — far  and  away  the  greatest  ever 
erected  to  that  science — was  the  third  largest  building  in  the  Washington  area 
(after  the  Pentagon  and  the  new  State  Department  headquarters),  and  although 
its  1,400,000  square  feet  exceeded  the  C.I.A.’s  1,135,000,  it  proved  too  small 
after  only  five  years.  In  May  of  1963  the  J.  W.  Bateson  Co.,  Inc.,  was  awarded 
a contract  for  $10,940,000  to  construct  a nine-story  Operations  Building 
Annex  of  boxy,  modern  style  between  the  jutting  arms  of  the  square  A.  It 
added  500,000  square  feet  to  the  N.S.A.  headquarters  complex,  140,000  of  it 


N.S.A.  677 

in  a basement  area  almost  certain  to  be  used  for  computers.  The  annex  was 
completed  in  late  1965. 

This  expansion  was  clearly  made  necessary  by  the  rapid  growth  of  the 
agency.  In  1956,  the  director  told  a Senate  committee,  “We  have  almost 
9,000  civilian  employees  here  in  the  Washington  area  and  around  the  world." 
In  1960,  two  former  employees  reported  that  10,000  persons  worked  in  the 
Operations  Building.  Based  on  a nationwide  governmental  average  space- 
utilization  of  150  square  feet  per  worker,  the  two  N.S.A.  buildings  would 
house  more  than  12,500  employees;  based  on  the  figure  of  135  square  feet  per 
worker  that  modern  buildings  attain,  the  number  of  employees  there  would 
exceed  14,000.  This  is  certainly  greater  than  the  number  of  C.I.A.  employees 
in  Washington,  estimated  at  about  10,000,  and  even  when  the  uncertain 
numbers  of  employees  of  both  agencies  in  posts  around  the  world  are  added 
to  their  totals,  N.S.A.  is  still  larger  than  C.I.A.,  making  it  almost  certainly  the 
largest  intelligence  agency  in  the  free  world.  (At  least  a thousand  N.S.A. 
employees  are  stationed  overseas.  Several  hundred  work  in  each  of  two 
branches,  N.S.A.  Far  East  in  Japan  and  N.S.A.  Europe  in  Germany.  Others 
serve  with  N.S.A.’s  worldwide  intercept  net,  a few  as  radio  operators,  most 
as  supervisors,  since  nearly  all  the  intercept  operators  are  armed  forces 
personnel.)  N.S.A.’s  budget  has  also  been  reported  to  be  twice  as  large  as  the 
C.I.A.’s. 

Outside  the  agency  but  attached  to  it  is  a Scientific  Advisory  Board  of 
leading  figures  in  fields  related  to  cryptology,  such  as  mathematics  and 
electronics.  These  experts  are  in  business  or  at  universities,  but  they  bring 
outside  experience  and  new  insights  to  N.S.A.  problems.  The  board,  in  turn, 
is  advised  by  several  panels  of  specialists.  The  agency  also  receives  the  results 
of  the  cryptologic  research  of  an  independent  research  organization.  The 
Institute  for  Defense  Analyses  was  formed  in  1956  by  five  universities  to  offer 
academic  evaluation  of  defense  projects;  it  is  supported  by  government  con- 
tracts. In  its  fiscal  year  ending  February  28,  1959, 1.D.A.  received  a two-year 
contract  for  $1,900,000  to  build  and  operate  a laboratory  for  basic  research 
into  communication  theory  as  it  applies  to  Defense  Department  responsibili- 
ties. The  institute  created  a Communications  Research  Division  and  con- 
structed a brick  building  to  house  it,  complete  with  a Control  Data  Corpora- 
tion 1604  computer,  on  the  campus  of  Princeton  University.  The  division's 
first  director  was  Dr.  A.  Adrian  Albert,  then  54,  of  the  University  of  Chicago, 
one  of  America’s  outstanding  mathematicians,  with  a long  record  of  service 
to  his  country  and  his  science,  who  had  framed  cryptologic  concepts  in 
algebraic  terms  as  early  as  1941,  and  who  was  an  N.S.A.  consultant.  His  task 
seems  to  have  been  to  get  the  division  off  the  ground,  for  he  was  succeeded 
by  Dr.  J.  Barkley  Rosser,  and  then  by  deputy  director  Dr.  Richard  A.  Liebler, 
47,  who  had  worked  for  N.S.A.  from  1953  to  1958  and  was  an  old  friend  of 
N.S.A.'s  deputy  director.  Dr.  Louis  W.  Tordella  (they  had  taught  mathematics 
together  at  Illinois  in  1937  and  1938).

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  Communications  Research  Division  interests  bright  mathematicians 
in  the  general  field  of  communications  and  turns  them  loose  on  a project  that 
interests  them.  Sometimes  such  a project  bears  directly  on  advanced  practical 
problems,  often  dealing  with  rotor  systems;  sometimes  it  is  more  general, 
more  basic,  as  how  to  get  a computer  to  recognize  actual  English  text  instead 
of  a collection  of  letters  whose  statistics  resemble  English  text.  Its  policy  has 
been  to  hire  most  mathematicians  for  a year  only,  to  keep  bringing  fresh 
minds  to  bear.  The  size  of  the  mathematical  staff  has  remained  in  the  neighbor- 
hood of  the  24  of  its  first  year.  The  division  also  encourages  what  amounts  to 
basic  research  in  its  general  field.  It  sponsors  symposia,  such  as  one  on  finite 
groups  held  in  conjunction  with  the  American  Mathematical  Society,  and  one 
on  basic  mathematical  concepts  in  linguistics,  as  well  as  two  summer  campus 
projects,  scamp  and  alp,  which  introduce  the  academic  world  to  cryptology. 
Though  I.D.A.  contracts  with  the  Office  of  Naval  Research,  the  cryptologic 
results  are  all  sent  to  N.S.A. 

Still  other  cryptologic  agencies  outside  the  American  government  with 
which  N.S.A.  cooperates  are  those  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization. 
The  main  ones  are  ecsa,  the  European  Communication  Security  Agency  in 
Paris,  eusec,  the  Communication  Security  and  Evaluation  Agency,  Europe, 
in  London,  secan,  the  Communication  Security  and  Evaluation  Agency, 
N.A.T.O.,  in  Washington,  eudac,  the  Signal  Distribution  and  Accounting 
Agency,  Europe,  in  London,  and  dacan,  the  Signal  Distribution  and  Account- 
ing Agency,  N.A.T.O.,  in  Washington.  In  addition,  N.A.T.O.  has  several 
communication  agencies  that  use  the  security  material  provided  by  the  crypto- 
graphic agencies. 

None  of  these  is  a part  of  the  American  cryptologic  organization,  though 
all  participate  in  its  activities.  That  organization  is  not  exhausted  by  N.S.A., 
its  advisory  board,  and  the  agencies  that  feed  it  ideas  and  information.  The 
creation  of  A.F.S.A.  did  not  abolish  the  individual  cryptologic  agencies  of 
the  armed  services.  Though  subject  to  N.S.A.  in  technical  matters,  they 
remain,  as  units  of  the  Army,  the  Navy,  and  the  Air  Force,  administratively 
separate  from  it. 

Oldest,  and  probably  the  most  direct  ancestor  of  N.S.A.  in  view  of  its 
contributions  to  N.S.A.  of  the  core  personnel  of  Friedman,  Kullback,  Sinkov, 
and  Rowlett,  is  the  Army  Security  Agency.  It  can  trace  some  functions  back 
to  g.2  a. 6 and  the  Code  Compilation  Section,  both  of  the  A.E.F.,  but  admin- 
istratively it  stems,  though  tortuously,  from  Yardley’s  mi-8  and  his  Black 
Chamber  and  from  Friedman’s  two-man  cryptographic  bureau  in  the  War 
Department.  As  a well-defined  unit,  it  began  with  the  creation  of  the  Signal 
Intelligence  Service  in  1929.  It  continued  through  the  war,  changing  its 
name  first  to  the  Signal  Security  Service,  then  to  the  Signal  Security  Agency. 
On  September  15,  1945,  a few  days  after  the  war  ended,  the  War  Department 
detached  the  agency  from  the  Signal  Corps  and  placed  it  within  the  Intelli- 
gence Branch  (which  had  tried  at  least  four  times  during  the  war  to  steal  it). 


N.S.A. 


679 


It  was  renamed  the  Army  Security  Agency  and  was  given  authority  over  all 
Army  cryptologic  units,  which  had  previously  functioned  independently  under 
theater  commanders  and  merely  with  the  advice  of  the  Signal  Security  Agency. 

In  February,  1949,  Army  Regulation  10-125  set  forth  these  as  some  of 
A.S.A.’s  responsibilities: 

...  the  Chief,  Army  Security  Agency,  formulates  and  implements  plans,  policies, 
and  doctrine  on  communication  intelligence  and  communication  security  for  the 
Army,  and  is  specifically  responsible  for  the  following:  . . . 

b.  Production  of  communication  intelligence  for  the  Department  of  the  Army. 

c.  Investigation  of  the  means  employed  for  clandestine  communications;  and 
the  preparation,  detection,  and  processing  of  secret  inks,  microphotographs,  and 
open  codes  and  ciphers. 

d.  Technical  supervision  of  communication  security  activities  of  the  Depart- 
ment of  the  Army,  including  cryptocenter  activities,  programs  of  cryptographic 
instruction,  and  surveillance  of  friendly  radio  and  wire  traffic.  . . . 

j.  Preparation,  production,  storage,  distribution,  and  accounting  of  all 
registered  cryptomaterial,  together  with  the  publication  of  instructions  necessary 
for  the  use,  handling,  and  safeguarding  of  such  material,  except  in  such  cases 
where  these  duties  may  otherwise  be  specifically  assigned. 

Other  responsibilities  cover  command  of  A.S.A.  installations  and  units, 
liaison,  preparation  of  publications,  conduct  of  training  programs,  supervision 
of  the  Army  Security  Reserve,  and  advising  the  Department  of  the  Army. 

The  establishment  of  A.F.S.A.  and  N.S.A.  must  have  given  these  duties  a 
restricted  meaning.  Nevertheless,  so  greatly  had  communications,  and  con- 
sequently cryptology,  expanded,  that  on  April  14, 1964,  the  Army  redesignated 
the  agency  as  a major  field  command.  The  published  description  is  as  unin- 
formative as  that  of  N.S.A.:  “The  Commanding  General,  United  States 
Army  Security  Agency,  is  responsible  for  the  operations,  training,  administra- 
tion, services,  and  supply  of  all  units,  personnel,  activities,  and  installations 
under  his  command  throughout  the  world.  He  performs  specialized  technical 
functions  relating  to  the  national  security.” 

Two  of  his  chief  customers  must  be  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff  for  Intelli- 
gence (g-2),  in  whose  hands  are  placed  staff  responsibility  for  “communica- 
tions intelligence,  electronic  intelligence,  communications  security,  and  elec- 
tronic security  . . . ; Army  cryptologic  functions,”  and  the  Chief  of  Communi- 
cations-Electronics  (formerly  the  Chief  Signal  Officer),  who  advises  the  Chief 
of  Staff  on  “communications,  including  pertinent  communications  security.” 
The  Chief  of  Communications-Electronics  is  assisted  in  his  function  of  sup- 
plying cryptographic  equipment  to  the  Army  by  the  United  States  Army 
Signal  Communications  Security  Agency,  which  buys,  distributes,  registers, 
stores,  and  repairs  that  equipment.  It  follows  each  item  from  point  to  point 
with  forms  bearing  titles  like  “Cryptomaterial  Distribution  Summary 
Record”  and  “Cryptomaterial  Consolidated  Flyleaf  Receipt.”  Headquarters

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

of  the  U.S.  Army  Security  Agency  remains  at  the  Arlington  Hall  Station  in 
Virginia. 

The  Navy’s  cryptologic  agency  remains  buried  in  the  Office  of  Naval 
Communications,  and  little  more  is  known  of  it  beyond  its  name — Naval 
Security  Group — and  its  location  at  Nebraska  Avenue.  Presumably  it  feeds 
information  to  the  Office  of  Naval  Intelligence,  and,  like  the  other  agencies, 
its  radio  stations  do  intercept  work  for  N.S.A.  On  December  31,  1963,  the 
Navy  had  10,701  men  performing  cryptologic  duties,  both  in  the  Navy  itself 
and  detached  to  N.S.A.,  or  about  1 man  in  70. 

The  United  States  Air  Force  Security  Service,  by  contrast,  actually  issues 
a press  kit.  Activated  in  October,  1948,  it  is  now  a major  command  of  the  Air 
Force,  headquartered  in  a spanking  new  three-story  building  in  the  shape  of 
an  inverted  U at  Kelly  Air  Force  Base,  San  Antonio,  Texas.  It  operates  more 
than  50  units  in  14  nations  under  four  geographical  subdivisions:  European 
Security  Region  at  Frankfurt,  Pacific  Security  at  Hawaii,  the  6940th  Security 
Wing  at  Goodfellow  Air  Force  Base,  Texas,  and  the  6981st  Security  Group  at 
Elmendorf  Air  Force  Base,  Alaska.  It  also  trains  specialists  at  the  U.S.A.F.S.S. 
Technical  School  at  Goodfellow. 

Its  press  kit  describes  its  operations  in  this  way: 

Foreign  nations  who  cherish  harmful  designs  against  the  Free  World  are 
constantly  seeking  useful  information  regarding  the  U.S.  Aerospace  forces.  A 
prime  target  for  such  information  seekers  is  the  United  States  Air  Force  com- 
munications system. 

The  primary  responsibility  for  insuring  that  these  nations  are  denied  access  to 
information  transmitted  over  U.S.A.F.  communications  facilities  is  vested  in  the 
United  States  Air  Force  Security  Service  (U.S.A.F.S.S.).  This  mission  is  one  of 
communications/electronic  surveillance — or  more  simply  stated  “providing 
communications  security  for  the  Air  Force.” 

First  of  all,  A.F.S.S.  technicians  attempt  to  develop  and  supply  the  necessary 
techniques  and  specialized  equipment  needed  to  safeguard  classified  information 
being  transmitted  by  electrical  means  by  the  Air  Force. 

Secondly,  these  technicians  monitor  and  analyze  unclassified  Air  Force 
electrical  communications  to  determine  the  amount  of  information  of  intelligence 
value  that  can  be  derived  from  these  communications. 

Finally,  A.F.S.S.  reports  to  the  originator  of  such  communications  the 
information  developed  and  any  procedural  discrepancies  noted,  and  they  make 
the  necessary  recommendations  for  securing  these  communications  against  ex- 
ploitation by  unauthorized  agents  or  agencies. 

All  this  is  performed,  of  course,  under  the  general  guidance  of  the  N.S.A. 
Thus  the  codebooks  and  the  lists  of  authenticators  that  U.S.A.F.S.S.  produces 
must  conform  to  N.S.A.  policy.  And  the  United  States  Government  Organiza- 
tion Manual  adds  to  a one-sentence  statement  of  the  U.S.A.F.S.S.  monitoring 
duties  this  second  sentence:  “Additionally,  U.S.A.F.  Security  Service  units 
occasionally  conduct  research  in  communication  phenomena  in  support  of 


N.S.A. 


681 


various  elements  of  the  U.S.  Government.”  That,  of  course,  is  a perfectly 
marvelous  euphemism  for  interception.  Some  of  the  material  must  go  to 
N.S.A.,  some  to  the  Air  Force  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff,  Intelligence  (a-2). 

The  Army  Security  Agency,  and  probably  the  other  two  service  crypto- 
logic agencies  as  well,  maintains  reserve  components  as  a pool  of  cryptologic 
talent  in  time  of  mobilization  or  emergency.  During  the  Berlin  crisis  of  1961, 
three  Army  Security  Agency  units  were  among  the  first  reservists  to  be  called 
up.  They  were  stationed  at  the  A.S.A.  School  at  Fort  Devens,  Massachusetts 
— though  one  battalion  had  to  come  all  the  way  from  California.  The  others 
were  the  197th  A.S.A.  Company  from  New  York  and  the  324th  A.S.A. 
Battalion,  with  members  from  Chicago. 

The  chiefs  of  the  three  military  cryptologic  agencies  serve  under  the  com- 
manders of  their  own  armed  services,  who  also  sit  as  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff, 
which  serves  as  the  military  staff  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense.  The  staff  of  the 
Joint  Chiefs  includes  a Directorate  for  Communications-Electronics  (j-6), 
whose  Security  and  Electronic  Warfare  Division  prepares  cryptologic  plans. 
These  must  be  individual  programs  for  specific  operations,  presumably  laid 
out  under  principles  established  by  N.S.A.  The  Director  of  Communications- 
Electronics  is  assisted  in  his  work  by  the  Military  Communications-Electronics 
Board,  comprised  of  the  chief  communications  officers  of  the  Army,  Navy, 
Air  Force,  and  Marine  Corps.  Among  its  1 1 part-time  panels  of  military  per- 
sonnel is  one  on  security  and  cryptography  and  another  on  electronic  warfare. 
Also  within  the  purview  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  is  the  Defense  Intelligence  Agency, 
which  undoubtedly  receives,  through  the  service  intelligence  units,  informa- 
tion that  has  originated  in  the  service  cryptologic  agencies  as  well  as  in  the 
National  Security  Agency. 

N.S.A.,  however,  does  not  fall  under  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff.  Under  an 
arrangement  that  became  effective  June  15,  1963,  the  N.S.A.  director  reports 
to  that  one  of  the  Assistant  Secretaries  of  Defense  who  serves  as  the  Deputy 
Director  of  Defense  Research  and  Engineering.  He  in  turn  reports  to  the 
Secretary  of  Defense,  who  sits  on  the  National  Security  Council,  which 
advises  the  President  on  domestic,  foreign,  and  military  policies  relating  to 
the  national  security.  The  other  members  of  the  National  Security  Council  are 
the  President,  the  Vice  President,  the  Secretary  of  State,  whose  department  is 
one  of  N.S.A. ’s  major  customers,  both  for  intelligence  and  for  security  policies, 
and  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Emergency  Planning,  which  handles  civil 
defense  and  civil  mobilization.  This  office,  which  comes  directly  under  the 
President,  includes,  as  an  assistant  director,  a Director  of  Telecommunica- 
tions Management.  As  the  President’s  Special  Assistant  for  Telecommunica- 
tions, he  coordinates  the  telecommunication  activities  of  the  government  and 
thus  may  be  involved  with  cryptologic  activities  in  a very  general  way. 

Serving  the  National  Security  Council  is  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency, 
which  correlates  information  from  the  several  branches  of  the  intelligence 
community  and  presents  it  to  the  Council.  There  is  a great  interchange  of  this

information  among  all  members  and  at  all  levels  of  the  intelligence  community. 
Thus,  N.S.A.  may  feed  some  intelligence  to  C.I.A.  and  some  to  State,  and 
may  in  turn  receive  cribs  to  solution  from  the  latter  and  some  actual  cipher 
keys  from  the  former.  Surprisingly,  C.I.A.  does  some  cryptanalysis  itself 
(Rowlett  worked  for  them  for  a while),  and  the  F.B.I.  Cryptanalytical  and 
Translation  Section  attacks  spy  ciphers,  such  as  Reino  Hayhanen’s  message 
found  in  the  hollow  nickel. 

The  interchange  of  information  is  controlled  by  the  United  States  Intelli- 
gence Board,  which  advises  C.I.A.  and  acts  as  a board  of  directors  for  the 
intelligence  community.  The  director  of  the  National  Security  Agency  sits  on 
this  board.  Other  members  include  the  director  of  the  Defense  Intelligence 
Agency,  the  heads  of  g-2,  O.N.I.,  and  a-2,  the  director  of  the  State  Depart- 
ment's Bureau  of  Intelligence  and  Research,  representatives  of  the  F.B.I.  and 
the  Atomic  Energy  Commission,  and  the  Director  of  Central  Intelligence, 
who  chairs  the  board. 

Watchdog  of  the  intelligence  community  is  the  President’s  Foreign 
Intelligence  Advisory  Board,  created  in  1961,  with  six  experienced  individuals 
from  outside  the  government  to  “conduct  a continuing  review  and  assess- 
ment” of  all  intelligence  functions.  The  board,  which  includes  a communica- 
tions expert  among  its  membership,  checks  up  specifically  on  N.S.A. 

These  multiple  points  of  contact  of  cryptology  with  other  elements  of  the 
American  government  show  how  vast  and  vital  and  complex  an  operation 
cryptology  has  become.  The  cost  of  the  operation  is  enormous.  In  1960,  the 
United  States  was  reportedly  spending  about  $380,000,000  a year  to  main- 
tain the  far-flung  N.S.A.  intercept  network  and  to  forward  the  material  to 
headquarters,  and  an  additional  $100,000,000  a year  to  pay  salaries  and 
operating  expenses  at  headquarters.  This  excludes  any  additional  costs  in- 
curred by  the  separate  service  agencies.  By  1966,  the  figure  had  reportedly 
zoomed  to  $1  billion  a year,  probably  including  the  cost  of  launching 
satellites  to  intercept  other  nations’  messages.  This  amounted  to  about  two 
per  cent  of  the  1966  national  defense  expenditure  of  $50  billion,  and  it  meant 
an  expenditure  of  over  $15  a year  for  cryptologic  protection  for  each 
American  family.  This  is  a budget  absolutely  without  precedent  in  the  history 
of  cryptology.  It  measures  the  distance  cryptology  has  traveled  just  since  the 
War  and  State  departments  paid  out  a total  of  a third  of  a million  dollars 
over  an  entire  decade  for  Yardley’s  American  Black  Chamber. 

The  figure  also  indicates  the  extraordinary  value  that  the  government 
places  on  cryptologic  material— or,  more  precisely,  on  the  information  con- 
tained within  the  armor  of  cryptography  and  on  the  intelligence  obtained  by 
cryptanalysis.  Great  value  demands  great  protection,  and  the  effort  to  protect 
has  shaped  the  characteristic  external  aspect  of  N.S.A.:  imperviousness, 
blankness,  silence,  utter  security.  The  efforts  to  attain  this  impregnability  are 
not  idle,  for  numerous  attempts  have  been  made  by  both  the  free  and  the 


N.S.A. 


685 


Communist  worlds  to  penetrate  each  other’s  cryptologic  secrets.  This  cloak- 
and-dagger  work  is  the  “practical  cryptanalysis”  which  the  Soviet  Union  has 
always  engaged  in,  and  which  it  has  pursued  with  great  vigor  throughout  the 
Cold  War. 

As  early  as  1946,  Soviet  agents  obtained  from  cipher  clerk  Emma  Woikin 
the  gists  of  plaintext  telegrams  of  the  Canadian  Ministry  of  External  Affairs, 
and  perhaps  details  of  the  ministry’s  cryptographic  systems.  Roy  A.  Rhodes, 
a married  Army  sergeant  assigned  to  the  motor  pool  at  the  American  embassy 
in  Moscow,  went  out  drinking  with  some  Russian  “mechanics”  around 
Christmas  of  1952  and  woke  up  in  bed  with  a girl  who  later  told  him  she  was 
pregnant;  threatened  with  disclosure  of  this  episode  to  his  wife,  Rhodes 
revealed  details  of  his  earlier  cryptographic  work  to  the  Russians.  In  1954,  a 
27-year-old  British  ex-soldier  named  John  Clarence  was  sentenced  to  five 
years’  imprisonment  forgiving  the  Russians  a codeword  of  “prime  importance” 
for  mobilizing  Britain’s  northeastern  air  defense. 

The  incidents  crowd  one  upon  the  other.  At  7 p.m.  on  March  5,  1957, 
Dhanapolo  Samarasekara,  a Ceylonese,  removed  what  was  almost  certainly 
the  Ceylonese  diplomatic  code  from  the  offices  of  the  Ceylonese  delegation  to 
the  United  Nations  in  New  York  and  delivered  it  to  Vladimir  A.  Grusha, 
first  secretary  of  the  Soviet  U.N.  delegation.  They  met  again  an  hour  later  and 
Samarasekara  returned  the  red-bound  book  to  the  filing  cabinets  of  the 
fourth-floor  code  room.  On  July  15,  Prime  Minister  S.  W.  R.  D.  Bandaranaike 
told  Ceylon’s  House  of  Commons  that  the  code  had  been  replaced  “as  a 
precaution.”  In  1959,  Vadim  A.  Kirilyuk,  a Russian  working  for  the  United 
Nations,  urged  an  American  who  the  Soviets  knew  from  a scholarship 
application  had  worked  on  cryptographic  machines  to  give  information  on 
them  and  to  get  a job  with  a vital  U.S.  agency,  presumably  N.S.A.  The 
American  strung  him  along  for  five  visits,  until,  in  January,  1960,  Kirilyuk  was 
declared  persona  non  grata  and  sent  home. 

The  care  and  thoroughness  that  Moscow  lavishes  upon  this  work,  and 
consequently  the  importance  with  which  it  regards  it,  is  nowhere  better  shown 
than  in  a letter  to  M.V.D.  representatives  in  Australia.  The  Russians  had  been 
trying  for  two  years  to  get  information  about  French  diplomatic  crypto- 
systems from  Mme.  Rose-Marie  Ollier,  a second  secretary  doing  crypto- 
graphic work  at  the  French  embassy  in  Canberra,  but  had  made  little  progress. 
On  January  2,  1952,  M.V.D.  headquarters  wrote: 

In  order  that  we  should  be  able  to  make  a maximum  use  of  Mme.  Ollier’s 
agent  capacities,  Pakhomov  must  in  the  first  place  ascertain  what  type  of  work 
she  carries  out  at  the  Embassy,  her  daily  work  routine:  when  she  starts  work, 
when  is  the  lunch-hour  break,  where  she  lunches,  when  she  finishes  work,  etc. 
It  is  particularly  necessary  to  elucidate  all  the  details  connected  with  the  ful- 
fillment of  her  duties  as  cipher  clerk,  namely:  in  what  room  is  she  engaged  on 
cipher  work,  where  the  cipher  documents  are  kept,  does  she  have  access  to  the 
safe,  where  the  ciphers  are  kept,  and  does  she  carry  on  her  person  the  keys  to  the 


686 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


safe,  etc.  It  is  also  absolutely  necessary  to  elucidate,  at  first  orally,  the  actual 
technique  of  the  enciphering  and  deciphering  of  cables.  The  elucidation  of  all 
these  details  is  necessary  to  enable  us  to  determine  what  would  be  the  best  way, 
least  liable  to  exposure,  of  effecting  the  acquisition  of  deposits  of  ciphers  of  her 
embassy. 

Pakhomov  failed  to  get  any  information  from  Mme.  Ollier,  and  was  recalled 
in  part  because  of  this.  Moscow  then  transferred  the  assignment  to  Vladimir 
Petrov  (adding  “ciphers  of  countries  of  Anglo-American  bloc”),  but  he  did 
not  succeed  either.  The  Australian  Commission  on  Espionage  that  investigated 
this  and  other  matters  following  Petrov’s  defection  declared  that  “If  they, 
the  M.V.D.,  could,  unknown  to  the  French,  get  the  key  to  their  communica- 
tions, the  security  not  only  of  France  but  of  the  whole  Western  world  might 
well  be  in  jeopardy.” 

Strangely,  this  bitter  possibility  came  partly  true  in  1954,  when  the  Rus- 
sians, having  failed  with  France  in  Australia,  succeeded  in  Paris.  Communists 
in  the  message  center  of  the  French  National  Defense  Committee  stole  a War 
Ministry  cryptosystem  and  used  it  to  read  orders  to  the  embattled  bastion  of 
Dien  Bien  Phu.  This  inside  information  may  have  contributed  to  the  ultimate 
capitulation  of  that  fortress,  to  France’s  consequent  loss  of  French  Indochina, 
and  so  to  the  miseries  and  warfare  in  Laos  and  Vietnam  that,  more  than  a 
decade  later,  still  plagued  the  West. 

The  effort  to  get  cryptologic  material  is  not  limited  to  the  Russians.  The 
Poles  photographed  Irwin  W.  (Doc)  Scarbeck,  41,  second  secretary  of  the 
American  embassy  in  Warsaw,  naked  in  bed  with  his  22-year-old  Polish  mis- 
tress, who  then  urged  him  “to  get  for  them  the  cipher.”  They  also  offered 
him  20,000  zlotys,  or  $833,  for  the  cryptographic  information,  but  he  refused. 
On  Formosa  in  1957,  organized  rioters  with  axes  concentrated  on  smashing 
their  way  into  the  American  embassy  code  room  during  anti-American  demon- 
strations. Failing  to  force  the  heavy  iron  door  guarding  the  codes,  they  hacked 
through  a six-inch  concrete  wall.  The  ambassador  on  the  spot  said  that  this 
would  mean  “some  readjustment”  of  U.S.  codes,  but  Secretary  of  State  John 
Foster  Dulles  later  reassured  the  nation  that  none  had  been  compromised. 

The  free  world  engages  in  practical  cryptanalysis  too,  and  it  has  had  its 
triumphs.  In  the  nature  of  things,  they  are  less  publicized  than  the  failures. 
Two  former  N.S.A.  employees  reported  that  “the  United  States  Government 
gave  money  to  a code  clerk  working  in  the  Washington  embassy  of  a United 
States  ally  [later  identified  as  Turkey]  for  supplying  information  which  assisted 
in  the  decryption  of  that  ally’s  code  messages.”  They  also  revealed  that  crypt- 
analytic  “success  in  at  least  one  case  has  also  been  facilitated  by  the  fact  that 
the  United  States  supplied  to  other  nations  cipher  machines  for  which  it  knew 
the  construction  and  wiring  of  the  rotors.”  Another  ex-employee  disclosed 
that  “N.S.A.  also  obtains  the  originals  of  national  ciphers  from  secret  sources. 
This  indicates  that  someone  steals  the  ciphers  of  the  Near  East  countries  for 
the  Americans.  In  N.S.A.  I actually  saw  photocopies  of  ciphers  of  the  Syrian 


N.S.A. 


687 


General  Staff,  and  also  instructions  for  using  them.”  In  Sofia  in  1963,  former 
Bulgarian  Communist  diplomat  Ivan-Asen  K.  Georgiev  pleaded  guilty  to 
charges  of  spying  that  included  having  disclosed  the  code  of  the  Bulgarian 
mission  to  the  United  Nations  to  an  American  professor,  who  was  probably 
a C.I.A.  agent. 

How  lax  security  can  be  at  some  places  is  indicated  by  the  experience  of 
two  American  girls  doing  secretarial  work  for  the  Iranian  mission  to  the 
United  Nations.  From  time  to  time,  when  the  mission’s  Hagelin  machine 
jammed  and  the  Iranians  could  not  clear  it,  they  called  in  the  girls,  who  seemed 
to  have  a mechanical  knack,  to  get  it  working  again.  The  gross  security 
blunder  of  letting  two  Americans — who  might  have  been  (but  were  not) 
reporting  to  the  C.I.A. — examine  so  vital  a secret  seems  never  to  have  occurred 
to  the  Iranians. 

Practical  cryptanalysis  has  even  been  acknowledged  at  the  highest  level. 
The  source  is  none  other  than  Nikita  Sergeyevitch  Khrushchev.  While  sight- 
seeing in  Los  Angeles  with  U.S.  Ambassador  to  the  U.N.  Henry  Cabot  Lodge 
during  his  1959  visit  to  the  United  States,  the  Soviet  Premier  boasted  that  he 
had  seen  a message  that  President  Eisenhower  had  sent  to  Prime  Minister 
Nehru  of  India  about  border  troubles  with  Red  China,  as  well  as  a message 
to  Eisenhower  from  the  Shah  of  Iran.  Earlier,  in  Washington,  he  remarked  to 
C.I.A.  chief  Allen  Dulles  that  C.I.A.  agents  gave  their  codebooks  to  the 
Russians,  which  the  Soviets  used  to  feed  false  information  to  the  C.I.A.  and 
to  demand  and  receive  money.  He  suggested  that  the  U.S.  and  the  U.S.S.R. 
save  money  by  pooling  intelligence  services. 

It  was  no  joke  to  American  security  officials,  particularly  those  involved 
in  cryptology.  They  go  to  extraordinary  lengths  to  prevent  security  leaks.  The 
United  States  channels  cryptologic  information  through  a separate  security 
category  of  its  own.  Cryptographic  equipment  and  documents  are  distributed, 
stored,  and  registered  separately  from  other  classified  equipment  and  docu- 
ments. Top-secret  security  clearances  will  not  automatically  permit  their 
holders  to  see  cryptologic  information:  this  requires  a special  crypto  clear- 
ance. Army  Regulation  380-5  on  military  security  accords  cryptology  an 
entire  special  section.  President  Kennedy's  Executive  Order  10964  on  security 
exempts  cryptologic  material  “from  automatic  downgrading  or  declassifica- 
tion,” and  adds:  “Nothing  in  this  order  shall  prohibit  any  special  require- 
ments that  the  originating  agency  or  other  appropriate  authority  may  impose 
as  to  communications  intelligence,  cryptography,  and  matters  related  there- 
to.” 

Similarly,  Congress  in  1950  agreed  with  Defense  Department  contentions 
that  neither  the  Espionage  Law  of  1917  nor  the  Yardley  Law  of  1933  (which 
covered  only  diplomatic  codes)  afforded  sufficient  protection  to  American 
cryptologic  affairs.  It  enacted*  Public  Law  513,  codified  as  Title  18,  Section 

* The  Report  from  the  Senate  Committee  on  Armed  Services  recommending  passage 
of  the  bill  (S.  277)  was  submitted  by  Lyndon  B.  Johnson. 


688 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


798,  United  States  Code,  which  specifically  made  it  a crime,  punishable  by  a 
fine  of  $10,000  and  a jail  term  of  10  years,  to  disclose  classified  information 
concerning  American  or  foreign  cryptosystems,  “the  communication  intelli- 
gence activities  of  the  United  States  or  any  foreign  government,”  or  material 
“obtained  by  the  processes  of  communication  intelligence.” 

This  special  protection  stems  in  part  from  the  extraordinary  damage  that 
betrayal  of  cryptosystems  can  do.  Knowledge  of  a cipher  system  can  give  an 
enemy  insight  into  quantities  of  information,  whereas  knowledge  of,  say,  a 
particular  weapon  is  limited  to  that  item.  In  part,  the  protection  is  needed 
because  of  the  special  sensitivity  of  cryptanalytic  intelligence.  A nation  can 
change  its  codes  upon  the  merest  suspicion  that  they  are  being  read  and  can 
thus  deprive  its  foe  of  an  important  source  of  intelligence.  But  to  deprive  the 
foe  of  intelligence  obtained  by  a spy  means  first  finding  that  spy  in  a large 
population. 

The  presidential  directive  that  created  the  National  Security  Agency  was 
and  is  classified  as  security  information,  and  the  veil  thus  thrown  around  the 
agency  at  its  very  birth  has  cloaked  it  to  this  day.  N.S.A.  is  even  more  still, 
more  secret,  and  more  grave  than  the  C.I.A.,  whose  basic  functions  are  set 
forth  in  the  1947  law  that  created  it.  C.l.A.  officials  have  occasionally  issued 
statements  to  the  press  and  have  more  often  leaked  favorable  publicity.  N.S.A. 
officials  never  have.  The  National  Security  Agency  thus  remains  the  most 
reticent  and  least  known  organ  of  the  entire  hush-hush  American  intelligence 
community. 

At  N.S.A.  security  begins  outside.  Three  fences  ring  the  headquarters 
building.  The  inner  and  outer  are  Cyclone  fences  topped  with  V’s  of  barbed 
wire.  The  middle  one  is  a five-strand  electrified  wire.  These  are  pierced  by 
four  gatehouses  manned  by  Marine  guards.  When  the  gates  are  closed,  a 
complicated  electronic  apparatus  involving  mirrors  and  lights  buzzes  warn- 
ingly.  Gatehouse  3,  on  the  north  side  of  the  building,  is  open  24  hours  a day. 

Security  permeates  N.S.A.’s  interior  as  well.  Both  the  agency’s  organiza- 
tion and  the  physical  arrangements  that  reflect  this  organization  are  highly 
compartmented,  with  numerous  checkpoints,  and  employees  are  not  per- 
mitted to  enter  areas  in  which  they  do  not  work  without  special  permission. 
Colored  badges  limit  them  to  their  own  areas.  Pistol-packing  guards  block 
the  entrance  to  specially  restricted  areas.  The  most  secret  documents  must  be 
locked  in  three-tumbler  safes  except  when  analysts  are  actually  working  on 
them — and  these  areas  are  also  patrolled  night  and  day.  Offices  that  generate 
the  least  confidential  documents  in  quantity  may  store  them  in  desks  or  in 
file  cabinets,  sometimes  unlocked,  but  these  offices  are  under  constant  armed 
guard.  When  classified  papers  must  be  taken  from  N.S.A.  to  other  agencies, 
employees  must  not  go  alone  if  they  use  a private  car  but  must  travel  in  pairs. 
They  must  keep  the  papers  in  a locked  briefcase  and  must  store  them  over- 
night in  a safe  stowage  either  at  the  other  agency  or  at  N.S.A.;  they  may  not 
take  them  home. 


N.S.A. 


689 


Similar  precautions  are  taken  wherever  cryptologic  material  is  used.  At  the 
United  States  mission  to  the  United  Nations  in  New  York,  the  code  room  is 
protected  by  a solid  steel  door  three  and  a quarter  inches  thick.  Guards  patrol 
the  corridor  outside.  Windows  are  frosted.  White  plastic  domes  on  the  ceiling 
emit  ultrasonic  rays  that  sound  a warning  if  anyone  moves  in  the  room  after 
hours.  The  cipher  machines  themselves  stand  in  an  alcove  around  a corner, 
hidden  from  the  eyes  of  anybody  at  the  door  or  admitted  to  the  main  message 
area.  And  to  cut  down  on  the  number  of  times  that  the  door  has  to  be  opened, 
the  code  room  has  its  own  pantry — and  its  own  toilet. 

N.S.A.  security  extends  even  to  unclassified  letters  to  private  citizens. 
Unlike  other  government  agencies,  its  envelopes  are  imprinted  on  the  inside 
with  markings  that  prevent  anyone  from  reading  the  text  of  the  letter  through 
the  envelope.  And  N.S.A.  carefully  words  these  letters  to  reveal  as  little  as 
possible  about  itself.  One  minor  slip-up  gave  away  the  agency  technique.  An 
amateur  cryptologist  offered  N.S.A.  his  translation  of  a German  doctoral 
dissertation  in  mathematics  with  cryptologic  applications.  He  did  not  refer 
to  it  as  a dissertation.  N.S.A.  declined  the  offer  by  saying  that  it  “has  no  need 
of  this  dissertation” — a clear  indication  that  the  agency  knew  of  the  document 
and  probably  had  it  as  well,  but  did  not  want  to  admit  an  interest  in  cryp- 
tology by  saying  so.  N.S.A.  supervisors  tell  new  employees  that  this  appar- 
ently obsessive  preoccupation  with  security  constitutes  a large  margin  of 
safety:  If  the  employee  does  not  talk  about  even  the  obvious,  he  will  not  come 
close  to  talking  about  secret  matters.  In  addition,  this  blanket  coverage  makes 
it  much  easier  for  N.S.A.  to  maintain  security  than  a selective  discrimination 
and  release  of  items,  such  as  textbooks,  that  are  not  really  secret. 

Among  the  agency’s  deep  secrets  is  its  annual  budget.  N.S.A.  does  not 
appear  in  the  federal  budget.  All  its  funds,  like  those  of  the  C.I.A.,  are  cun- 
ningly concealed  by  adding  a few  million  dollars  to  each  of  several  line  items 
in  other  parts  of  the  budget.  The  chiefs  of  the  agencies  whose  budget  figures 
are  thus  padded  know  only  that  the  money  is  for  a classified  project,  but  in 
many  cases  Congress  is  told  in  executive  sessions  what  the  figures  are  for  these 
projects.  The  Secretary  of  Defense  can  legally  shift  the  funds  from  one  unit  to 
another,  within  certain  limits.  Unlike  the  C.I.A.,  N.S.A.  finances  are  audited 
by  the  Government  Accounting  Office.  The  results,  however,  have  not  been 
shown  to  Congress,  G.A.O.’s  boss. 

The  employees  themselves  must  pass  the  strictest  security  standards  in  the 
Department  of  Defense.  A prospective  employee  must  pass  the  National 
Agency  Check,  in  which  several  investigative  agencies  report  any  facts  they 
have  bearing  on  his  loyalty.  He  must  also  pass  a lie  detector  test.*  He  may 
then  be  hired  for  training,  but  final  clearance  depends  upon  a full  Background 
Investigation.  This  involves  verification  of  birth,  education,  and  employment 
records,  interviews  with  friends,  neighbors,  and  former  co-workers  and 

* This  has  led  to  abuses.  One  17-year-old  girl,  trying  to  get  a job  as  clerk-typist  with 
N.S.A.,  was  asked  many  over-intimate  questions  about  her  sex  life.

employers  on  his  trustworthiness  and  maturity,  analysis  of  credit  records,  and 
a further  check  for  membership  in  subversive  organizations.  No  one  who  has 
close  kin  in  an  Iron  Curtain  country  may  be  hired.  Even  after  having  passed 
these  requirements  and  been  hired,  all  employees  undergo  follow-up  checks 
every  four  years  to  make  sure  that  their  security  clearance  should  be  main- 
tained. All  except  some  of  the  older  employees  must  pass  repeated  lie  detector 
tests.  They  must  also  periodically  sign  a certificate  that  they  have  read  Public 
Law  513. 

N.S.A.  dins  security  security  security  security  into  its  employees  with 
remorseless  persistence  until  it  becomes  more  than  habitual,  more  than  second 
nature — it  becomes  virtual  instinct.  Many,  perhaps  most,  N.S.A.ers  never  tell 
their  wives  and  children  just  what  their  jobs  are.  “N.S.A.,”  they  explain, 
stands  for  “Never  Say  Anything.”  The  Security  Education  Program  pulls  out 
all  stops : “Our  job  with  N.S.A.  is  essential  to  the  preservation  of  our  American 
way  of  life.  As  part  of  that  job,  fulfilling  our  security  obligations  is  equally 
essential  to  the  success  or  failure  of  this  Agency  in  the  accomplishment  of  its 
mission.”  So  thorough  is  the  indoctrination  that  one  employee  wondered  in  a 
poem  whether  being  not  allowed  to  say  what  he  did  in  this  world  would  have 
dire  effects  in  the  next: 

But  to  St.  Peter,  must  I say, 

“I  learned  my  lesson  well. 

You  see,  I worked  at  N.S.A., 

So  send  me  on  to 

The  bitter  irony  of  all  this  is  that,  despite  all  the  precautions,  N.S.A.  has 
been  involved  in  security  breaches  more  spectacular  and  more  damaging  to 
the  free  world  than  any  others  in  the  Cold  War  except  those  of  the  atomic 
spies. 

The  first  involved  Joseph  Sidney  Petersen,  Jr.  His  arrest  October  9, 
1954,  for  taking  classified  documents  from  A.F.S.A.-N.S.A.  made  front-page 
news  in  both  the  largest  U.S.  daily— the  New  York  Sunday  News— and  the 
most  respected — The  New  York  Times.  Petersen,  39,  a former  physics  teacher, 
had  taken  the  Army  correspondence  course  in  cryptanalysis  in  1940  and  1941 
a-d  had  joined  the  Signal  Intelligence  Service  in  mid-1941.  In  his  13  years  at 
Arlington  Hall  he  worked  on  almost  every  problem  and,  on  his  own  initiative 
just  after  the  war,  began  giving  sorely  needed  and  “very  successful”  instruc- 
tion in  cryptology  for  new  employees  and  for  old  ones  who  had  become  over- 
specialized. This  training  program  was  made  official  in  1953,  becoming  the 
basis  for  the  present  N.S.A.  School.  Petersen  said  he  took  two  of  the  classified 
documents  to  help  in  preparing  lessons.  One  was  Chinese  Telegraphic  Code 
SP-D,  with  addenda  and  errata,  dated  July  1,  1945,  and  classified  “secret”; 
this  is  the  Ming  commercial  code  in  which  10,000  Chinese  ideographs  are 
assigned  four-digit  codenumbers  so  that  they  can  be  sent  by  telegraph,  with

some  agency  annotations.  The  other  was  A.F.S.A.  23  0763;  KC  037,  “Routing 
of  North  Korean  Political  Security  Traffic  as  Indicated  by  Group  A2,”  dated 
February  20,  1951,  a traffic  analysis  classified  “top  secret.” 

During  World  War  II,  the  tall,  myopic  Petersen  had  become  friends  with 
short,  trim  Colonel  J.  A.  Verkuyl  of  the  Royal  Netherland  Indies  Army,  one 
of  Holland’s  finest  cryptanalysts  (with  two  others,  he  drew  up  the  report  on 
the  cryptography  of  nordpol  for  the  Dutch  government).  Verkuyl,  a liaison 
officer,  sat  at  the  desk  next  to  Petersen  in  Arlington  Hall  as  together  they 
solved  Japanese  diplomatic  code  messages — a field  in  which  Verkuyl  had  had 
considerable  prewar  experience.  Through  Verkuyl,  Petersen  met  Giacomo 
Stuyt,  communications  officer  at  the  Dutch  embassy.  Their  mutual  interest  in 
mathematics  and  in  their  work  led  them  into  discussions  of  cryptology. 

After  the  war,  when  Verkuyl  returned  to  Holland,  Petersen  mailed  him 
ideas  about  instructional  methods  and  other  details  helpful  to  his  setting  up 
of  a cryptologic  corps  in  Holland.  Stuyt  stayed  in  America  and  Petersen  re- 
mained friendly  with  him.  The  Dutch  at  this  time  were  using  the  Hagelin 
machine  for  their  diplomatic  communications,  and  in  1948  Petersen,  for 
reasons  that  have  never  been  explained,  copied  top-secret  notes  indicating 
American  success  in  breaking  Netherlands  cryptosystems  and  removed  a 1939 
Signal  Intelligence  Service  document  entitled  “Analysis  of  the  Hagelin 
Cryptograph,  Type  b-211,”  and  showed  them  to  Stuyt.  (The  b-211  was  not 
the  m-209  widely  used  in  World  War  II:  it  was  the  printing  version  of  the 
machine  that  Hagelin  had  invented  in  1925,  nine  years  before  he  created  the 
c-36,  ancestor  of  the  m-209.)  Verkuyl  thinks  that  Petersen  was  motivated,  not 
by  any  intent  to  harm  the  United  States’  cryptanalytic  effort,  but  to  help 
secure  the  communications  of  his  friends  from  other  nations’  prying. 

When  F.B.I.  agents  searched  Petersen's  apartment  in  the  fall  of  1954,  they 
found  the  notes  and  documents.  It  was  the  first  case  to  come  under  Public 
Law  513.  Perhaps  for  that  reason  the  Justice  and  Defense  departments  de- 
cided to  prosecute  instead  of  handling  the  matter  administratively  within 
N.S.A.  to  prevent  publicity.  Possibly  they  sought  to  make  an  example  out  of 
Petersen.  But,  as  his  lawyer  said,  “they  had  a bear  by  the  tail  after  the 
decision  was  made,”  for  the  arrest  attracted  tremendous  news  coverage.  The 
prosecution  urged  him  to  withdraw  his  plea  of  not  guilty  and  to  plead  guilty 
to  prevent  the  exposure  of  evidence  that  a trial  would  require.  Petersen,  filled 
with  remorse,  eager  to  repair  the  damage  he  had  done  to  his  country,  and 
hoping  to  lighten  his  sentence,  agreed.  It  seems  likely  that  the  government 
hinted  at  a light  or  suspended  sentence.  Federal  District  Judge  Albert  V. 
Bryan  did  dismiss  two  of  the  indictment’s  three  counts.  But,  declaring  that 
“The  pith  of  this  offense  is  not  what  the  defendant  withdrew,  but  that  he  with- 
drew, records  from  the  National  Security  Agency,”  he  sandbagged  Petersen 
with  a seven-year  term.  Petersen  served  four  years  before  being  paroled.  The 
government  thus  managed  to  create  an  example  for  other  potential  offenders 
without  the  risks  of  a trial.  How  fair  it  was  to  Petersen  remains  an  open

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


question.  But  perhaps  one  should  not  argue  with  success:  since  Petersen, 
there  have  been  no  more  prosecutions  for  leaking  cryptologic  information. 

In  the  most  spectacular  of  the  security  breaches,  the  only  reason  for  the 
failure  to  prosecute  was  the  venue  of  the  potential  defendants,  well  beyond  the 
jurisdiction  of  federal  authorities.  They  had  gone  to  Soviet  Russia.  These 
were  the  turncoat  American  cryptologists,  William  Hamilton  Martin  and 
Bernon  Ferguson  Mitchell,  who  in  90  minutes  of  blabbing  at  a Moscow 
press  conference  in  1960  told  more  to  a bigger  audience  in  less  time  about  any 
nation’s  intelligence  effort  than  any  other  traitors  have  ever  done. 

Though  much  is  known  about  these  two  young  men,  nothing  is  really 
known  about  why  they  betrayed  their  country.  Both  were  West  Coast  boys, 
both  extremely  bright,  both  raised  in  an  atmosphere  as  American  as  apple 
pie,  and  both  “clean”  enough  to  pass  the  rigorous  Navy  cryptologic  clearance. 
Bernon  Mitchell,  born  March  11,  1929,  grew  up  in  Eureka,  California,  where 
his  father  had  a successful  law  practice.  He  concentrated  on  science  in  high 
school  and  engaged  in  such  adolescent  pranks  as  filling  balloons  with  hydro- 
gen and  exploding  them  in  airbursts  that  frightened  the  neighbors.  When  a 
teacher  would  lead  him  no  further  into  the  theory  of  relativity  than  he  himself 
had  gone,  he  abruptly  quit  Eureka  High  School  and  transferred  to  another 
school  80  miles  north.  He  declared  himself  an  agnostic,  debated  philosophy 
aggressively,  played  poker  with  a few  close  friends,  read  deeply  in  the  philo- 
sophy of  mathematics.  A tall,  lean  youth  with  dark  wavy  hair  and  regular 
features,  he  seldom  dated.  In  1951,  after  a year  and  a half  at  the  California 
Institute  of  Technology  and  under  pressure  from  the  draft,  he  enlisted  in  the 
Navy.  He  was  cleared  for  cryptology  and  assigned  to  that  work  at  the  Yoko- 
suka Naval  Base. 

There  he  met  William  Martin,  a soft-faced  youth  who  was  born  May  27, 
1931,  in  Columbus,  Georgia.  The  Martins  had  moved  to  Ellensburg,  Wash- 
ington, when  Bill  was  15.  He  was  so  brilliant  a student  in  junior  high  school 
that  a psychologist  tested  him  to  see  if  he  should  skip  high  school  altogether 
and  enter  the  University  of  Chicago  in  a program  for  gifted  children.  He  was 
scholastically  qualified  for  it,  but  his  principal  thought  he  was  neither  mature 
nor  socially  developed  enough  to  bypass  high  school.  Nevertheless,  he  finished 
three  high  school  years  in  two.  His  interests  lay  in  hypnotism,  reading, 
psychology,  and  chess;  at  17,  he  won  the  chess  championship  of  the  North- 
west. He  always  wore  a white  shirt  and  tie  but  evinced  no  interest  in  girls.  His 
personality  was  almost  overbearing:  he  was  quite  capable  of  giving  gratuitous 
and  insulting  advice  to  adults.  He  studied  a year  at  Ellensburg’s  Central 
Washington  College  of  Education — where  he  developed  an  interest  in  mathe- 
matics— before  joining  the  Navy  and  meeting  Mitchell  in  cryptologic  work. 

The  two  became  firm  friends  during  their  four-year  tours.  After  Mitchell 
returned  to  the  United  States  to  study  mathematics  at  Stanford  University, 
where  he  had  a B average  in  the  subjects  that  N.S.A.  needed,  Martin  stayed 
on  in  Japan  to  do  cryptologic  work  for  the  Army,  then  came  back  home  to

major  in  mathematics  at  the  University  of  Washington.  He  had  almost  straight 
a’s  for  his  last  two  years.  Both  were  separately  approached  by  N.S.A.  re- 
cruiters a few  days  apart  in  February  and  March,  1957,  and  offered  employ- 
ment. Both  accepted  and  were  hired  as  mathematicians,  Civil  Service  grade 
GS-7,  at  about  $6,000  a year,  reporting  for  duty  July  8, 1957,  apparently  under 
an  interim  security  clearance.  Later,  under  a lie  detector  examination,  Mitchell 
admitted  that  he  had  engaged  in  sexual  experiences  with  dogs  and  chickens 
when  he  was  between  13  and  19;  the  agency’s  security  office  felt  that  this 
adolescent  experimentation  did  not  furnish  sufficient  basis  for  denying  final 
clearance,  which  was  eventually  granted.  Martin’s  investigation  revealed  that 
acquaintances  considered  him  an  insufferable  egotist,  slightly  effeminate,  not 
wholly  normal,  somewhat  irresponsible,  and  susceptible  to  flattery.  His 
superiors  almost  unanimously  said  that  they  would  not  want  to  have  him 
work  for  them  again,  but  all  except  one  affirmed  that  he  was  loyal  to  the 
United  States.  Both  men  attended  the  N.S.A.  School  during  the  summer,  then 
studied  at  George  Washington  University  in  the  fall.  Both  reported  to  N.S.A.’s 
Office  of  Research  and  Development  on  January  27,  1958,  for  cryptologic 
duties.  Mitchell’s  final  clearance  had  come  through  four  days  earlier;  Martin’s 
was  not  granted  until  May  12. 

They  took  separate  bachelor  apartments  in  Laurel,  Maryland,  not  far 
from  N.S.A.  headquarters.  Martin  began  picking  up  girls  in  Washington 
bars.  Both  joined  the  Washington  Chess  Divan,  and  Mitchell  captained  the 
N.S.A.  chess  team.  Martin’s  work  was  so  good  that  the  head  of  Research  and 
Development  gave  him  a letter  of  praise  and  approved  him  for  a N.S.A. 
scholarship.  He  later  won  an  extension  of  this  for  another  year— the  first  in 
N.S.A.  to  get  a two-year  scholarship.  Under  this,  he  went,  in  September,  1959, 
to  the  University  of  Illinois  to  take  a master’s  degree  in  mathematics,  while 
also  studying  Russian.  Mitchell,  in  Washington,  had  an  unhappy  love  affair 
with  a married  woman  who  was  separated  from  her  husband. 

During  this  year,  both  men  first  expressed  strong  anti-American  political 
feelings.  Martin  associated  with  a Communist  at  Illinois,  and  in  December, 
1959,  he  and  Mitchell  traveled  to  Cuba  in  violation  of  N.S.A.  directives.  It  has 
been  reported,  however,  that  they  had  been  members  of  the  Communist 
party  since  at  least  February  4,  1958,  when  membership  cards  were  allegedly 
issued  to  them.  Both  felt  so  strongly  opposed  to  the  then-secret  U-2  flights 
over  the  Soviet  Union,  which  they  knew  about  through  their  work,  that  they 
visited  Representative  Wayne  Hayes,  an  Ohio  Democrat,  to  warn  him  of  the 
“great  dangers.”  In  May,  1960,  Mitchell,  who  worked  out  regularly  with 
barbells  and  had  posed  for  nude  color  slides  seated  on  a velvet-covered  stool, 
began  visiting  psychiatrist  Dr.  Clarence  Schilt  for  intellectual  discussions  of 
homosexuality. 

In  June,  soon  after  Martin  had  returned  from  Illinois,  the  two  applied  for 
annual  leave  for  the  two  and  a half  weeks  from  June  24  to  July  11.  This  was 
approved,  and  their  supervisor  also  authorized  them  to  extend  their  leaves  to

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


July  18  in  case  they  needed  more  time  to  visit  their  parents’  homes  on  the 
West  Coast.  They  never  went  there.  Instead,  they  purchased  one-way  tickets 
to  Mexico  City  on  Eastern  Air  Lines  Flight  305,  leaving  Washington’s 
National  Airport  a little  before  noon  on  June  25.  From  Mexico  City  they 
flew  to  Havana  on  July  1.  From  there  they  apparently  sailed  on  a Soviet 
trawler  to  Russia.  For  nearly  a month  nothing  happened.  On  July  26,  their 
chief  tried  to  reach  them  at  their  Laurel  apartments  and  at  their  parents’ 
homes,  and,  when  he  could  not,  notified  the  personnel  office.  When  a quiet 
investigation  turned  up  the  flight  to  Mexico,  the  Defense  Department  on 
August  1 announced  their  unauthorized  absence,  and  four  days  later  con- 
ceded that  “there  is  a likelihood  that  they  have  gone  behind  the  Iron  Curtain.” 

They  stepped  back  in  front  of  it  September  6 in  the  brightly  lit  theater  of 
Moscow’s  House  of  Journalists.  At  a lavishly  staged  press  conference,  they 
read  a long  statement  announcing  that  they  had  renounced  their  American 
citizenship  and  had  received  Soviet  citizenship,  and  giving  their  reasons  for 
their  defection: 

Our  main  dissatisfaction  concerned  some  of  the  practices  the  United  States 
uses  in  gathering  intelligence  information.  We  were  worried  about  the  United 
States  policy  of  deliberately  violating  the  airspace  of  other  nations,  and  the 
United  States  Government's  practice  of  lying  about  such  violations  in  a manner 
intended  to  mislead  public  opinion. 

Furthermore,  we  were  disenchanted  by  the  United  States  Government’s 
practice  of  intercepting  and  deciphering  the  secret  communications  of  its  own 
allies.  Finally,  we  objected  to  the  fact  that  the  United  States  Government  was 
willing  to  go  so  far  as  to  recruit  agents  from  among  the  personnel  of  its  allies. 

They  chose  Russia,  they  said,  because: 

In  the  Soviet  Union  our  main  values  and  interests  appear  to  be  shared  by  a 
greater  number  of  people.  Consequently  we  feel  that  we  will  be  better  accepted 
socially  there  and  will  be  better  able  to  carry  out  our  professional  activities. 

Another  motivating  factor  is  that  the  talents  of  women  are  encouraged  and 
utilized  to  a much  greater  extent  in  the  Soviet  Union  than  in  the  United  States. 
We  feel  that  this  enriches  Soviet  society  and  makes  Soviet  women  more  desirable 
as  mates. 

Following  which  double-talk,  they  proceeded  to  reveal  American  suc- 
cesses in  cryptanalysis  on  an  enormous  scale.  Their  revelations  caused  many 
nations  to  change  keys  and  systems,  though,  astonishingly,  some  of  the  very 
nations  named  took  no  action  at  all.  The  result  was  a partial  dim-out  of 
United  States  communications  intelligence — and  probably  of  Soviet  Russia’s 
as  well.  Some  N.S.A.  cryptanalysts  went  on  double  shifts,  beginning  the  com- 
plex reconstruction  of  rotor  wirings  and  lug  and  pin  settings  all  over  again. 
The  first  reaction  of  N.S.A.ers  was  shock;  the  second,  anger:  “The  dirty 
bastards!”  President  Eisenhower  branded  them  traitors.  The  Pentagon, 


N.S.A. 


695 


stating  that  one  was  “mentally  sick”  and  both  “obviously  confused,”  de- 
nounced the  statements  of  both  as  “falsehoods”— itself  a falsehood,  in  view 
of  the  Defense  Department’s  own  concession  in  its  bill  of  particulars  in  the 
Petersen  case  that  it  had  broken  the  code  of  its  Dutch  ally.  The  House  Un- 
American  Activities  Committee  and  a special  subcommittee  of  the  House 
Armed  Services  Committee  launched  investigations,  as  did  the  Pentagon. 

No  one  ever  came  up  with  a satisfactory  explanation  of  why  the  two  men 
had  defected.  It  was  suggested  that  they  might  have  been  homosexuals;  but 
if  they  were,  they  would  not  have  had  to  go  to  Russia  to  practice  their  per- 
version. On  the  other  hand,  there  seemed  no  evidence  of  overt  homosexual 
activities  that  might  have  subjected  them  to  blackmail.  The  report  of  their 
being  Communists  does  not  say  why  they  joined  the  party.  Some  have  sug- 
gested that  the  immorality  of  codebreaking  might  have  revolted  them,  which 
is  what  the  pair  hinted  at  in  their  Moscow  statement;  but  why  should  this 
trouble  only  them  so  drastically  and  not  other  N.S.A.ers?  One  possible 
reason:  a basic  personality  imbalance.  Another  theory  for  their  defection 
involves  the  “syndrome  of  the  labyrinth,”  in  which  the  seq^cy  of  the  work 
precluded  any  external  recognition.  Here,  too,  this  affected  only  Martin  and 
Mitchell.  Least  satisfactory  of  all  reasons  was  one  of  their  own:  that  the 
United  States  spies  on  its  allies.  This  displays  a willful  blindness  to  the  duplicity 
of  Soviet  espionage  and  Soviet  policy  in  general.  A Freudian  hypothesis  has 
never  been  confuted,  but  never  confirmed  either:  that  the  two  were  in  un- 
conscious rebellion  against  their  fathers  and  had  displaced  this  emotion  onto 
the  father  figure  of  the  government.  The  answer  will  probably  never  be  known. 

In  its  investigation,  however,  the  House  Un-American  Activities  Com- 
mittee turned  up  some  further  violations  of  security  in  what  it  called  “the 
most  sensitive  and  secretive  of  all  agencies  established  by  the  U.S.  Govern- 
ment to  protect  the  Nation’s  security  and  that  of  its  people  in  a deadly  cold 
war.”  Twenty-six  sexual  deviates  were  found  to  be  employed  by  the  agency; 
these  were  fired.  Personnel  procedures  were  shockingly  lax.  The  agency 
habitually  employed  personnel  before  full  clearances  had  been  obtained.  This 
practice,  permitted  under  an  emergency  regulation,  had  begun  in  the  man- 
power-short years  of  the  Korean  War,  but  remained  in  effect  a decade  later. 
N.S.A.  often  ignored  derogatory  information  uncovered  during  background 
investigations.  It  relied  too  heavily  on  lie  detector  results.  In  at  least  one  case, 
it  hired  a person  denied  employment  by  another  government  agency  because 
he  was  strongly  suspected  of  both  homosexuality  and  Communist  activities. 

The  most  ironic  violations  involved  the  agency’s  directors  of  security  and 
of  personnel.  The  general  counsel  of  the  Defense  Department  had  said 
piously:  “A  system  of  checks  and  balances  has  been  established  to  protect  the 
integrity  of  the  Agency’s  security  requirements.  The  authority  to  hire  em- 
ployees is  delegated  to  the  Director  of  Personnel,  but  the  authority  to  grant 
security  clearances  is  delegated  to  the  Director  of  Security.”  When  the  House 
committee  got  through,  the  arrangement  looked  more  like  a mutual  cover-up. 


696 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Maurice  H.  Klein,  the  personnel  director,  admitted  that  he  had  stated  on  his 
own  employment  forms  that  he  had  been  graduated  from  Harvard  Law  School 
when  in  fact  it  had  been  from  New  Jersey  Law  School,  and  that  he  had  tried 
to  conceal  this  and  a few  other  peccadilloes  by  retyping  and  falsely  dating  his 
records.  The  director  of  security,  former  F.B.L  agent  S.  Wesley  Reynolds, 
knew  of  these  discrepancies  but  concluded  that  they  “did  not  have  security 
significance.”  Both  men  resigned,  Reynolds  under  a rule  banning  acceptance 
of  favors  from  those  doing  business  with  the  government. 

A year  after  the  committee  issued  its  report,  a former  N.S.A.  employee 
revealed  more  American  cryptologic  secrets  in  a letter  in  Izvestia.  He  was 
Victor  Norris  Hamilton,  an  Arab  who  had  become  a naturalized  American 
citizen  and  changed  his  name  from  Hindali  after  coming  to  the  United  States 
with  the  American  woman  he  had  met  in  Libya  and  then  married.  A graduate 
of  the  American  University  in  Beirut,  he  worked  as  a doorman  and  bellhop  in 
Georgia  because,  he  said,  he  was  barred  from  teaching  because  he  was  an 
Arab.  A retired  American  colonel  recruited  him  for  N.S.A. , and  he  began 
work  there  June  13, 1957,  as  a $6,400-a-year  research  analyst — or  cryptanalyst 
— solving  the  cryptosystems  of  Arab  countries.  Hamilton  was  forced  to 
resign  on  June  3,  1959.  According  to  him,  officials  became  suspicious  when 
he  wanted  to  reestablish  contact  with  relatives  in  Syria.  According  to  the 
Defense  Department,  he  was  “approaching  a paranoid-schizophrenic  break.” 
Whatever  the  reason,  he  sought  asylum  in  the  Soviet  Union  and  presumably 
told  that  government  of  his  work  before  writing  his  letter  to  denounce 
America’s  espionage  practices. 

Hamilton’s  letter  appeared  in  Izvestia  on  July  23,  1963.  On  that  very  day, 
an  N.S.A.  clerk-messenger  committed  suicide  by  inhaling  carbon  monoxide 
in  his  car  when  he  realized  that  the  jig  was  up  in  his  game  of  selling  crypto- 
logic secrets  to  the  Russians.  He  was  Sergeant  First  Class  Jack  Edward  Dun- 
lap, a decorated  combat  veteran  with  an  unblemished  record,  a family  man, 
an  average  Joe.  He  seemed  to  be  an  ideal  security  risk  when  he  was  assigned 
to  N.S.A.  in  April,  1958,  as  part  of  an  Army  Security  Agency  unit.  His  first 
job  was  as  chauffeur  to  Major  General  Garrison  B.  Cloverdale,  N.S.A.’s 
assistant  director  and  chief  of  staff.  Later  he  was  graduated  to  clerk-messen- 
ger duties. 

The  how  and  the  what  of  Dunlap’s  treason  have  never  been  officially 
revealed.  The  why,  however,  has  become  abundantly  clear:  $60,000.  He 
spent  it  on  a 30-foot  cabin  cruiser,  a world’s-championship  hydroplane 
skimmer  capable  of  more  than  100  miles  per  hour,  a baby-blue  Jaguar  sports 
car,  two  late-model  Cadillacs,  rounds  of  drinks  for  the  house  at  expensive 
resorts  and  yacht  clubs  from  New  Jersey  to  Florida,  and  a blonde  mistress. 
He  apparently  began  peddling  his  secrets  in  mid-1960,  while  Martin  and 
Mitchell  were  planning  their  runaway,  for  in  June  of  that  year  he  bought  the 
cabin  cruiser  with  a $3,400  cash  payment.  He  seems  to  have  smuggled  out 
the  top-secret  documents  under  his  shirt  (guards  did  not  frisk  personnel,

though  briefcases  were  spot-checked),  and  turned  them  over  to  the  Russians, 
at  first  once  a week,  later  once  a month.  His  mistress  knew  only  that  he  visited 
“the  bookkeeper”  regularly  and  returned  with  a large  roll  of  bills.  He  told 
acquaintances  various  stories  to  explain  his  new  wealth : that  he  owned  land 
on  which  a mineral  valuable  for  cosmetics  had  been  discovered;  that  he  had 
come  into  a little  inheritance;  that  his  father — actually  a bridge-tender — 
owned  a large  plantation  in  Dunlap’s  native  Louisiana.  What  he  told  and 
gave  the  Russians  is  unknown  to  Americans,  but  it  may  have  included  top- 
secret  American  estimates  of  the  capabilities  of  the  Soviet  Army  and  Navy 
and  nuclear  forces,  together  with  similar  data  on  North  Atlantic  Treaty 
Organization  forces. 

Despite  N.S.A.’s  vaunted  security  programs,  none  of  this  was  discovered 
— even  though  Dunlap  drove  to  work  in  his  Jaguar  or  one  of  the  Cadillacs, 
took  time  off  to  race  his  hydroplane,  began  dating  an  N.S.A.  secretary. 
Ironically,  N.S.A.  had  sent  an  Army  ambulance  to  return  him  to  Fort  Meade 
Army  Hospital  when  he  injured  his  back  in  a regatta,  lest  the  local  hospital 
give  him  sedatives  which  might  make  him  talk — yet  never  once  wondered  how 
he  could  afford  the  yacht  club  in  the  first  place.  He  was  trapped,  not  by  alert 
N.S.A.  work,  but  by  his  own  greed.  Fearful  that  he  might  be  transferred  out 
of  N.S.A.  at  the  end  of  his  duty  tour,  he  applied  in  March,  1963,  to  leave  the 
Army  but  keep  his  N.S.A.  job  as  a civilian.  This  brought  him  into  contact 
with  a lie  detector  for  the  first  time;  service  personnel  assigned  to  the  agency 
are  not  subjected  to  a polygraph  test,  but  prospective  civilian  employees  are. 
Two  tests  discovered  evidence  of  petty  thievery  and  immoral  living. 

For  two  months  nothing  happened.  He  continued  his  job  and  his  thefts. 
Then  further  investigations  disclosed  that  he  was  living  beyond  his  pay,  and 
he  was  quickly  transferred  to  a routine  job  in  a Fort  Meade  orderly  room  with 
no  access  to  secret  information.  The  investigation  dragged  slowly  on,  and  it 
was  not  until  a month  after  Dunlap  killed  himself — after  two  unsuccessful 
attempts — that  the  leisurely  sleuths  discovered  that  Dunlap’s  widow  had 
found  a sheaf  of  highly  classified  official  papers  among  her  husband’s 
belongings.  For  the  first  time  the  F.B.I.  was  called  in,  but  Dunlap’s  death 
ended  all  hope  of  learning  exactly  what  he  had  peddled  to  the  Reds.  “To  be 
safe,”  one  authority  said,  “you  have  to  proceed  on  the  assumption  that  every- 
thing which  passed  through  this  section  might  be  resting  in  a file  in  Moscow.” 

Episodes  like  these  are  bad  in  the  short  run,  but  in  the  long  run  their 
effects  may  be  salutory.  They  shook  the  National  Security  Agency  out  of  its 
smug  self-complacency.  For  the  agency  had  been  so  sure,  so  cocksure,  so 
almost  arrogantly  certain  that  all  cryptologic  wisdom  resided  behind  its 
triple  fence,  that  its  secrecy  was  hermetic,  that,  while  improvement  was  always 
possible,  there  was  very  little  room  left  for  it  at  N.S.A. 

Take,  for  example,  the  case  of  the  road  signs.  When  N.S.A.  moved  to 
Fort  Meade,  large  white-on-green  signs  pointing  to  it  blossomed  on  the

Baltimore-Washington  Expressway.  After  employees  became  familiar  with 
the  new  location,  the  signs  were  removed,  presumably  as  a security  measure. 
One  can  just  hear  the  security  staff  congratulating  itself  for  thinking  of  even 
that  tiny  detail.  Yet  at  that  moment  the  agency  was  harboring  Martin, 
Mitchell,  Hamilton,  and  Dunlap,  as  well  as  a dishonest  director  of  personnel, 
a favor-taking  director  of  security,  and  a couple  of  dozen  sex  deviates. 

The  agency  impressed  itself  mightily.  The  Ming  telegraphic  code,  which 
Petersen  had  taken,  is  a case  in  point.  This  is  a public  code  which  the  agency 
republished  with  some  annotations  and  classified  “secret.”  An  official  ex- 
plained that  “It  [the  N.S.A.  version]  identifies  it  [the  public  code]  with  the 
agency,  and  therefore,  indirectly  it  implies  the  work  of  the  agency.”  But  the 
legal  criterion  for  classifying  information  “secret”  is  that  its  disclosure  could 
“result  in  serious  damage  to  the  nation.”  One  wonders  whether  in  so  grading 
the  Ming  code  the  agency  does  not  exaggerate  its  importance  a little. 

The  thick  swaddling  of  secrecy  insulated  the  agency  from  external  ex- 
amination and  cauterization.  As  the  Un-American  Activities  Committee 
wrote,  “Past  efforts  by  the  Defense  Department  to  investigate  N.S.A.  were 
ineffective  for  the  most  part  because,  when  matters  involving  irregularities  at 
the  Agency  were  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Department,  it  more  often 
than  not  appointed  as  the  investigators  of  the  irregularities  the  very  N.S.A. 
officials  responsible  for  their  existence.”  So  strong  was  the  agency’s  resistance 
to  outside  criticism  that,  the  committee  reported,  “In  1960,  when  the  investi- 
gation began,  obstacle  after  obstacle  was  placed  in  the  path  of  the  committee.” 
After  Robert  S.  McNamara  became  Secretary  of  Defense  in  1961,  he  co- 
operated much  more  closely  with  the  committee  than  had  his  predecessor, 
Thomas  S.  Gates,  Jr. 

“The  results,”  the  committee  said,  “were  rewarding.”  N.S.A.  tightened  its 
employment  security  practices.  For  example,  it  denied  conditional  employees 
access  to  sensitive  material  until  they  were  fully  cleared.  It  stopped  delegating 
the  director’s  authority  to  grant  interim  clearance  for  access  to  top-secret 
material.  It  appointed  a board  of  psychiatric  consultants  to  improve  its 
psychological  assessment  program.  It  required  supervisors  to  notify  the 
personnel  and  security  offices  within  two  hours  of  any  worker’s  unauthorized 
absence.  It  alerted  supervisors  to  signs  of  undue  mental  strain.  The  agency 
also  instituted  some  additional  reforms,  such  as  the  expansion  and  reorganiza- 
tion of  its  Office  of  Security  Services. 

But  perhaps  the  most  important  result  was  the  improvement  in  N.S.A.’s 
attitude.  It  swallowed  the  bitter  pill  of  Congressional  criticism  and  cured  itself 
of  its  infallibility  syndrome.  It  discovered  that  there  were  things  outside  Fort 
Meade  that  it  could  learn  with  profit.  Cooperation  between  the  committee 
and  N.S.A.  “proved  most  beneficial  to  the  committee’s  investigation  and  to 
the  Agency’s  self-analysis  of  its  programs  and  practices,”  the  committee 
wrote.  “The  committee  is  confident  that,  through  its  efforts,  N.S.A.  has 
been  helped  and  the  national  interest  and  security  strengthened.  It  also 


N.S.A. 


699 


believes  that  the  N.S.A.  and  Defense  Department  have  made  a significant  con- 
tribution to  the  national  security  by  the  manner  in  which  they  assisted  the 
investigation  and  took  steps  to  correct  deficiencies  pointed  up  in  the  course  of 
the  inquiry.” 

This  return  to  reality  was  also  marked  by  an  increasing  maturity  in 
security  matters.  The  agency  is  less  hysterical  about  petty  details,  suggesting 
that  it  is  more  confident  in  essential  points.  For  several  years,  N.S.A.  re- 
cruiting pamphlets  did  not  so  much  as  mention  the  words  code  and  cipher, 

or  any  related  words — presumably  for  the  same  reason  that  the  Ming  code 
was  stamped  “secret.”  But  in  1964,  a pamphlet  for  prospective  employees 
declared:  “N.S.A.,  as  the  Agency  of  the  government  responsible  for  the 
security  of  all  U.S.  communications  systems,  has  need  to  recruit  and  develop 
specialists  in  cryptography.”  At  about  the  same  time,  the  agency  declassified 
William  F.  Friedman’s  1937  War  Department  publication  on  the  Zimmermann 
telegram.  These  incidents  imply  that  the  agency  has  closed  the  gap  that  the 
case  of  the  road  signs  epitomized— the  gap  between  what  the  agency’s 
preening  self-esteem  told  it  and  what  things  were  really  like. 

All  this  points  up  the  value  of  Congressional  surveillance  of  intelligence 
agencies.  Yet  Congress  has  shown  an  odd  reluctance  to  put  into  practice  the 
lessons  of  this  case  history.  Subcommittees  of  the  House  and  the  Senate  Armed 
Services  and  Appropriations  Committees  undoubtedly  oversee  N.S.A.’s 
operations,  as  they  do  those  of  the  C.I.A.,  but  these  shadowy  groups— they 
are  not  even  listed  in  the  Congressional  Directory — appear  to  be  less  than  vig- 
orous in  discharging  these  duties. 

Though  the  Dunlap  case  came  after  reforms  instituted  as  a result  of  the 
House  Un-American  Activities  Committee  investigation,  both  houses  of 
Congress  declined  to  look  into  it.  “If  a similar  series  of  tragic  blunders  oc- 
curred in  any  ordinary  agency  of  Government,’  wrote  a journalist  who  had 
studied  the  Dunlap  case  in  detail,  “an  aroused  public  would  insist  that  those 
responsible  be  officially  censured,  demoted,  or  fired.”  Said  Stewart  Alsop: 
“The  N.S.A.  particularly  could  do  with  a bit  of  supervision.  It  has  a horrible 
security  record. ...  If  the  C.I.A.  had  been  responsible  for  either  case  [Martin- 
Mitchell  and  Dunlap],  there  would  have  been  a hullabaloo  to  make  the 
Alger  Hiss  case  seem  tame.”  (To  put  the  N.S.A.  episodes  into  perspective: 
C.I.A.  has  not  yet  suffered  a single  known  defection  or  penetration.)  Even  the 
Un-American  Activities  Committee  used  kid  gloves.  “The  sensitive  nature  of 
the  operation  of  the  National  Security  Agency  was  recognized  and  respected 
by  the  Committee  on  Un-American  Activities  during  its  investigation  and 
hearings.  The  committee  did  not  attempt  to  learn  the  details  of  the  organiza- 
tional structure  or  the  products  of  the  Agency,  feeling  it  had  no  need  for 
knowledge  in  these  areas.”  Yet  greater  knowledge  may  well  have  produced 
greater  benefits. 

Indeed,  Congress  behaves  toward  N.S.A.  as  if  it  is  trying  to  propitiate 
the  sorcerers  who  control  the  dark  powers  of  cryptology.  In  1956,  the  director,

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Lieutenant  General  Ralph  J.  Canine,  testified  before  a House  committee  in 
favor  of  a bill  to  increase  the  number  of  high-paying  ($10,000  to  $15,000) 
scientific  jobs  in  the  government,  including  N.S.A.  Chairman  Tom  Murray 
later  told  the  House  that  “The  committee  was  so  impressed  with  the  need  for 
adequately  compensating  people  who  have  devoted  a lifetime  to  this  very 
important  area,  that  at  the  request  of  General  Canine  we  increased  the 
amount  from  the  original  submission  of  35  to  50  of  these  positions."  In  1959, 
Congress  passed  Public  Law  36  to  exempt  the  N.S.A.  from  the  legal  require- 
ment binding  all  government  bodies  to  file  a full  description  of  each  job  in 
the  agency  with  the  Civil  Service  Commission. 

In  1964,  Congress  gave  the  director  of  N.S.A.  the  power  to  fire  at  will  any 
N.S.A.  employee  “whenever  he  considers  that  action  to  be  in  the  interest  of 
the  United  States.”  An  identical  bill  had  died  in  the  Senate  Judiciary  Com- 
mittee in  the  previous  Congress.  Both  had  been  introduced  by  the  House  Un- 
American  Activities  Committee  as  a result  of  its  Martin-Mitchell  investiga- 
tion. They  wrote  into  law  some  of  the  stricter  employment  practices  that  the 
committee  and  the  agency  had  agreed  upon.  In  both  Congresses,  the  sum- 
mary discharge  power  was  bitterly  attacked  as  a violation  of  the  Bill  of 
Rights  principle  that  no  one  shall  be  “deprived  of  life,  liberty,  or  property, 
without  due  process  of  law.”  Liberals  in  the  House  quoted  the  Washington 
Post : “This  [bill]  is  the  very  definition  of  arbitrariness.  It  means  that  an  em- 
ployee could  be  discharged  and  disgraced  on  the  basis  of  anonymous  allega- 
tions without  the  slightest  opportunity  to  defend  himself — without  any  hear- 
ing at  all  and  without  any  administrative  review  or  even  any  judicial  review 
of  the  decision.  This  would  put  everyone  working  for  N.S.A.  at  the  mercy  of 
any  mischief-maker  or  malcontent  or  personal  enemy  who  might  call  him  a 
subversive  or  a homosexual  or  an  alcoholic.”  Though  the  bill’s  sponsors  did 
not  rebut  these  arguments,  the  bill  won  an  overwhelming  340  to  40  majority 
in  the  House  and  an  easy  voice  passage  in  the  Senate. 

N.S.A.  conjures  up  its  biggest  prizes  from  the  legislative  pocketbook.  For 
Congress,  which  can  treat  some  supplicants  for  funds  very  harshly,  smiles 
beneficently  upon  N.S.A.  In  1962,  the  House  Armed  Services  Committee 
named  a special  three-man  subcommittee  to  look  into  N.S.A.’s  request  for 
$10,000,000  for  its  nine-story  annex  and  for  money  to  hire  more  people. 
Since  this  plea  came  only  a few  years  after  Congress  had  given  the  agency 
some  $35,000,000  for  an  enormous  brand-new  home,  one  might  have  expected 
it  to  encounter  a rather  cool  reception.  Instead:  “After  an  exhaustive  briefing 
and  tour,  I personally  was  convinced  and  have  withdrawn  all  objection,”  said 
the  financially  conservative  Republican  member  of  the  subcommittee,  Dur- 
ward  G.  Hall  of  Missouri.  And  of  course  N.S.A.  got  the  money. 

What  is  the  potent  spell  that  N.S.A.  casts  over  Congress?  Why  this 
amazing  haste  to  grant  what  appears  to  be  the  slightest  whim  of  the  agency? 
Much,  no  doubt,  comes  from  the  simple  fact  that,  by  and  large,  the  agency 
does  a good  job.  But  part  also  comes  from  some  razzle-dazzle  by  the  agency's 


N.S.A. 


701 


using  the  ultra  secrets  to  which  its  work— unlike  other  agencies  of  the  govern- 
ment— gives  it  access.  Sometimes  it  lets  key  Congressmen  take  quick  peeks  at 
them,  join  the  privileged  fraternity  of  Those  Who  Know,  and  so  champion  the 
cause  of  their  fraternity  brother.  “The  members,  and  myself  in  particular,” 
said  Hall  of  his  tour,  “of  the  Armed  Services  Committee  have  probably  seen 
more  classified  equipment  and  been  exposed  to  more  classified  construction— 
from  communications  through  telemetry — than  most  Members  [of  Con- 
gress].” More  often  the  agency  enshrouds  its  secrets  in  fearful  gloom,  awing 
Congressmen  with  sacred  mysteries  that  are  no  more  to  be  uttered  than  is  the 
tetragrammaton.  “The  Agency  is  faced  with  enormous  security  responsi- 
bilities. The  missions  assigned  to  the  Agency  seek  to  fulfill  basic  requirements 
of  our  national  security.  All  activities  conducted  by  N.S.A.  to  carry  out  these 
missions  are  highly  classified.  Disclosure  of  the  nature  of  these  activities  or 
portions  of  them  could  seriously  impair  the  success  of  the  Agency’s  efforts.” 
So  intoned  the  counsel  of  the  Defense  Department,  and  so  an  almost 
trembling  House  committee  printed  it  in  support  of  the  summary-discharge 
bill. 

This  stratagem  plays  upon  Congress’  fear  and  ignorance.  Unfamiliar  with 
the  complexities  of  modern  cryptology,  the  legislators  worry  that  a single 
slip  could  betray  what  they  usually  refer  to  as  “the”  American  code  system. 
They  do  not  realize  that  there  is  not  one  but  dozens  or  hundreds  of  such 
systems,  and  that  a full  compromise  of  even  one  would  involve  a detailed 
description  of  a complex  mechanism,  lists  of  hundreds  of  rotor  wirings,  and 
long  schedules  of  keying  arrangements.  They  regard  cryptology  not  rationally 
as  what  it  is  but  superstitiously  as  a potent  magic — and  the  non-rational 
view  of  things  has  hardly  advanced  civilization. 

N.S.A.  exploits  this  attitude  to  withhold  as  much  information  as  it  can 
from  Congress.  Yet  one  may  wonder  whether  the  elected  representatives  of 
the  American  people  may  not  be  trusted  with  information  handled  daily  by 
typists  and  technicians. 

Although  these  N.S.A.  tactics  are  improper  and  shortsighted,  responsi- 
bility for  Congressional  supervision  rests  ultimately  upon  Congress.  It 
should  exercise  its  most  jealously  guarded  prerogative— investigation— as 
vigorously  in  the  intelligence  field  as  it  does  elsewhere.  The  President’s 
Foreign  Intelligence  Advisory  Board  cannot  substitute  for  Congress,  which  is 
in  a different  branch  of  government  from  the  intelligence  agencies  and  which 
holds  the  pursestrings.  Congressional  surveillance  would  benefit  both  N.S.A. 
and  the  nation  as  a whole.  It  would,  in  the  first  place,  help  keep  N.S.A.  from 
reverting  to  its  old,  dangerous  smugness;  the  Un-American  Activities  Com- 
mittee investigation  was  the  object  lesson  for  this.  It  would,  in  the  second 
place,  make  an  essentially  antidemocratic  operation  responsible  to  the  pro- 
cesses of  free  men.  The  mail-opening  activities  of  N.S.A.  are  repugnant  to 
Americans,  who  tolerate  them  reluctantly  only  because  of  the  Cold  War.  Its 
spyings  can  never  be  wholly  reconciled  with  the  ideals  of  a nation  founded 


702 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


on  a respect  for  the  dignity  of  the  individual.  But  they  can  be  made  account- 
able to  those  ideals,  as  embodied  in  the  elected  representatives  of  the  people. 

Furthermore,  to  the  extent  that  N.S.A.  produces  knowledge,  it  produces 
power,  and,  Thomas  Jefferson  said,  “whatever  power  in  any  government  is 
independent,  is  absolute  also.”  This  problem  is  not  as  acute  with  N.S.A.  as 
with  C.I.A.,  because  N.S.A.  neither  formulates  nor  executes  policy,  nor  does 
it  conduct  actual  operations,  such  as  Cuban  invasions.  Nevertheless,  N.S.A. 
should  be  energetically  supervised  by  Congress  to  prevent  abuse  of  power. 

All  this  is  a nuisance.  So  is  democracy.  It  is  much  easier  to  hire  a dictator 
than  to  bother  with  elections  and  all  the  other  details.  It  is  much  easier  not  to 
bother  with  checking  up  on  N.S.A.  But  it  must  be  done.  Otherwise  the  nation 
jeopardizes  some  of  the  very  freedom  that  N.S.A.  exists  to  preserve. 

Since  its  organization  in  1949,  A.F.S.A.-N.S.A.  has  always  been  headed 
by  a general  or  an  admiral.  The  three  services  rotate  the  command.  Terms 
have  ranged  from  18  months  to  more  than  four  years.  Six  men  have  directed 
this  silent  agency:  Rear  Admiral  Earl  Everett  Stone,  U.S.N.,  July,  1949,  to 
August,  1951 ; Lieutenant  General  Ralph  Julian  Canine,  U.S.A.,to  November, 
1956;  Lieutenant  General  John  Alexander  Samford,  U.S.A.F.,  to  November, 
1960;  Rear  Admiral  Laurence  Hugh  Frost,  U.S.N.,  to  May,  1962;  Lieutenant 
General  Gordon  Aylesworth  Blake,  U.S.A.F.,  to  June,  1965;  and  Lieutenant 
General  Marshall  Sylvester  Carter,  U.S.A.  The  only  thing  they  have  in  com- 
mon seems  to  be  their  conspicuous  absence  from  the  public  eye. 

Stone,  53  when  he  assumed  the  directorship,  had  been  in  communications 
for  virtually  all  his  Navy  career  except  sea  tours.  He  holds  a master  of  science 
in  communications  engineering  from  Harvard.  His  shore  duty  was  entirely  in 
naval  communications,  and  as  assistant  director  of  naval  communications 
from  1942  to  1944  he  commanded  the  Navy’s  communications-intelligence 
unit.  He  served  as  director  of  naval  communications  from  1946  until  his 
appointment  to  head  the  newly  formed  A.F.S.A.  After  his  two-year  tour,  he 
commanded  Cruiser  Division  1 during  the  Korean  War,  bombarding  shore 
installations,  and  then  held  two  high  naval  training  posts  before  retirement  in 
1958. 

Canine  was  the  only  N.S.A.  director  not  to  have  graduated  from  a service 
academy,  and  his  cryptologic  experience  was  limited  to  that  obtained  during 
a year’s  duty  as  part-time  communications  officer  from  1919  to  1920;  he  also 
had  very  broad  military  experience.  He  was  called  to  active  duty  as  a second 
lieutenant  of  field  artillery  in  1917  after  having  graduated  the  previous  year 
from  Northwestern  University.  He  served  with  the  A.E.F.,  and  in  June,  1919, 
became  communications  officer  and  adjutant  for  the  7th  Artillery  Brigade  at 
Camp  Funston,  Kansas,  presumably  handling  some  codes  and  ciphers. 
During  the  1920s  and  1930s,  he  taught  military  science  at  Purdue  University, 
studied  at  the  Field  Artillery  School,  and  served  as  a regimental  supply  and 
liaison  officer,  a trial  judge  advocate  for  courts-martial,  a post  exchange

officer,  a plans  and  training  officer,  student  at  the  Command  and  General 
Staff  School,  professor  of  military  science  at  Ohio  State  University,  and  as 
commander  of  the  99th  Field  Artillery  Battalion.  In  August,  1942,  he  became 
an  assistant  chief  of  staff  and  then  chief  of  staff  of  the  XII  Corps,  the  post  in 
which  he  served  through  Normandy,  the  Battle  of  the  Bulge,  and  contact  with 
the  Russians.  After  several  command  posts,  he  was  appointed  deputy  assis- 
tant chief  of  staff  for  intelligence  at  Army  headquarters  in  September,  1950, 
and  ten  months  later,  at  age  55,  took  over  A.F.S.A.,  which  became  N.S.A. 
during  his  four-year  term.  He  was  perhaps  the  best  liked  of  N.S.A.  directors. 

Samford  learned  to  fly  at  Kelly  Field  after  his  1928  graduation  from  West 
Point,  and  spent  the  prewar  years  in  routine  duties  at  hot  and  dusty  flying 
fields  in  Texas,  Illinois,  the  Canal  Zone,  Virginia,  and  Florida,  plus  a four- 
year  stint  as  a flying  instructor  at  Kelly  Field.  He  spent  most  of  World  War  II 
in  England  as  deputy  chief  of  staff  and  then  chief  of  staff  of  the  8th  Air  Force, 
whose  Flying  Fortresses  pounded  Germany.  For  two  years,  starting  in  1944, 
he  served  as  deputy  assistant  chief  of  staff  for  intelligence  at  Air  Force  head- 
quarters in  the  Pentagon,  and,  after  tours  as  commander  of  the  Antilles  Air 
Division  in  Puerto  Rico  and  of  the  Air  Command  and  Staff  School,  he  became 
director  of  intelligence  for  the  Air  Force  in  October,  1951.  In  July,  1956,  he 
became  deputy  director  of  N.S.A.,  serving  for  four  months  until  he  was  named 
director  at  age  51.  The  end  of  his  four-year  term  was  marred  by  the  Martin- 
Mitchell  scandal. 

Frost,  who  took  a two-year  postgraduate  course  in  line  and  applied 
communications  at  Annapolis  from  1933  to  1935,  spent  much  of  his  naval 
service  in  communications.  He  handled  presidential  messages  as  communica- 
tions officer  of  the  U.S.S.  Indianapolis  when  that  cruiser  took  Franklin  D. 
Roosevelt  on  a goodwill  tour  to  Argentina  in  1936.  He  was  decorated  for  his 
command  of  the  destroyer  Waller  in  the  Pacific  in  1943,  and  then  served  in 
communications  in  the  Solomons  and  in  Washington  to  the  end  of  the  war. 
From  1945  to  1950,  except  for  a year,  he  worked  in  intelligence,  and  after  a 
year’s  study  at  the  National  War  College  and  two  years  on  sea  duty,  including 
command  in  Korean  waters,  he  was  assigned  as  N.S.A.  chief  of  staff  from 
1953  to  1955.  Following  a year  of  sea  duty  he  was  named  director  of  naval 
intelligence  and  then  N.S.A.  director,  with  temporary  rank  of  vice  admiral. 
He  was  58.  After  a short  18-month  term,  during  which  he  bore  the  brunt  of 
the  House  Un-American  Activities  Committee  investigation,  he  was  named 
commandant  of  the  Potomac  River  Naval  Command. 

Blake  likewise  spent  nearly  all  his  service  career  in  communications, 
beginning  with  study  at  the  Signal  School  at  Fort  Monmouth  from  1933  to 
1934.  He  held  other  communications  posts  in  the  1930s,  and  during  World 
War  II  commanded  the  Army  Airways  Communications  System  in  the 
Pacific.  He  attended  the  Air  War  College  and  then  headed  research  and 
development  work  at  Wright-Patterson  Air  Force  Base,  Ohio,  for  tour  years. 
He  was  appointed  Air  Force  Director  of  Communications  in  1953  and,  three

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


years  later,  assistant  deputy  chief  of  staff  for  operations.  From  1957  to  1959 
he  commanded  the  U.S.A.F.  Security  Service.  After  serving  as  chief  of  staff, 
Pacific  Air  Forces,  and  commander,  Continental  Air  Command,  he  took  over 
N.S.A.  at  age  51. 

Carter,  who  had  been  deputy  director  of  the  C.I.A.  for  three  years,  had  to 
be  moved  from  that  post  when  President  Johnson  assigned  Admiral  William 
Raborn  as  Director  of  Central  Intelligence.  The  National  Security  Act  of 
1947  prohibits  both  top  C.I.A.  positions  from  being  held  simultaneously 
by  military  men.  When  Johnson  moved  Carter,  53,  to  N.S.A.,  the  general 
remarked:  “I’ve  had  some  beauts,  but  this  beats  them  all.”  Though  he  has 
had  no  specifically  cryptologic  experience,  Carter  is  probably  the  best  pre- 
pared of  all  N.S.A.  directors  in  view  of  the  great  pervasiveness  and  importance 
of  modern  communications  intelligence.  A 1931  graduate  of  West  Point,  he 
spent  his  first  ten  years  with  various  antiaircraft  artillery  units  and  teaching 
in  West  Point’s  Department  of  Natural  and  Experimental  Philosophy.  He 
spent  most  of  World  War  II  in  the  logistics  group,  Operations  Division,  War 
Department  General  Staff,  and  after  a brief  tour  in  China  was  named  special 
representative  in  Washington  for  General  Marshall,  then  on  his  China  mis- 
sion. When  Marshall  became  Secretary  of  State,  Carter  became  his  special 
assistant  in  January  of  1947,  serving  for  two  years  and  undoubtedly  getting  a 
good  picture  of  American  foreign  policy.  Between  1943  and  1949,  he  attended 
six  international  conferences,  including  the  Big  Four  at  Cairo  and  two  U.N. 
General  Assemblies.  After  brief  tours  in  the  American  embassy  at  London,  as 
a student  at  the  National  War  College,  and  as  commander  of  an  antiaircraft 
group  in  Japan,  he  served  from  1950  to  1952  as  director  of  the  executive 
office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  under  General  Marshall  and  his  successor, 
here  gaining  an  overall  view  of  American  defense.  From  November  1952  until 
his  appointment  to  the  C.I.A.  ten  years  later,  Carter  held  various  command 
posts  in  infantry,  antiaircraft,  and  air-defense  units.  His  three  years  as  No.  2 
man  in  the  C.I.A.  must  have  given  him  vast  experience  in  seeing  where  com- 
munications intelligence  fits  into  the  general  intelligence  pattern  and,  perhaps, 
many  ideas  for  helping  N.S.A.  better  fulfill  its  mission. 

Such  are  the  chieftains  of  history’s  largest  cryptologic  unit.  Though  their 
power  dwarfs  that  of  England’s  18th-century  Decyphering  Branch,  even  on  a 
relative  basis,  the  directors  probably  do  not  possess  even  a tenth  cf  Bishop 
Willes’s  cryptanalytic  ability.  Nor  do  they  need  it.  They  have  cryptanalysts 
to  handle  that  particular  specialty  among  the  dozens  of  specialized  functions 
that  modern  cryptology  entails.  Their  own  task  is  directed  outward,  at  Con- 
gressional committees,  at  the  United  States  Intelligence  Board,  at  the  Secre- 
tary of  Defense,  at  the  heads  of  the  service  cryptologic  agencies.  For  internal 
administration,  they  appear  to  lean  on  their  deputy  directors. 

These  deputy  directors  have  come  from  backgrounds  even  more  varied 
than  their  chiefs’.  The  first,  Captain  Joseph  N.  Wenger,  U.S.N.,  who  was 
named  A.F.S.A.  deputy  director  on  July  15,  1949,  had  spent  most  of  his 


N.S.A. 


705 


naval  career  after  graduation  from  Annapolis  in  1923  in  communications.  He 
headed  the  Navy’s  cryptanalytic  agency  at  Nebraska  Avenue  during  most  of 
World  War  II,  rising  to  deputy  director  of  naval  communications.  When 
N.S.A.  was  created,  he  became  vice  director,  a post  that  seems  to  be  no  longer 
in  existence;  he  left  N.S.A.  in  August,  1953. 

Deputy  director  for  about  four  years,  ending  in  1956,  was  Joseph  H.  Ream, 
a lawyer  who  had  worked  his  way  up  the  corporate  ladder  of  the  Columbia 
Broadcasting  System  to  become  secretary,  director,  and  executive  vice 
president  before  going  to  N.S.A.  Afterwards  he  returned  to  C.B.S.,  becoming 
vice  president  of  its  television  network  in  1959.  His  N.S.A.  successor  was  the 
late  Howard  T.  Engstrom,  holder  of  a Yale  Ph.D.  in  mathematics  who  had 
been  vice  president  of  Remington  Rand,  Inc.,  for  three  years  when  he  was 
tapped  for  N.S.A.  He  had  taught  mathematics  at  Yale  from  1926  to  1941, 
when  he  may  have  become  a Navy  cryptanalyst.  After  leaving  N.S.A.  in  1958, 
he  became  vice  president  of  Sperry  Rand,  Inc. 

Engstrom  was  succeeded  by  Louis  W.  Tordella,  who,  at  47,  was  the  youngest 
to  be  named  deputy  director  and  who  has  held  the  post  the  longest.  He  taught 
mathematics  at  Loyola  University  in  Chicago  and  at  Illinois  University  from 
1935  to  1942,  where  he  obtained  a Ph.D.  in  mathematics.  He  served  in  the 
Navy,  presumably  as  a cryptanalyst,  during  the  war;  afterwards,  he  remained 
with  the  Defense  Department.  His  mathematical  specialties  are  algebra, 
group  theory,  and  classical  number  theory.  His  appointment  may  represent  a 
trend  away  from  high-powered  managers  brought  in  from  the  outside  and 
toward  a policy  of  permanent  career  administrators  to  assure  stability  and 
continuity  despite  the  political  changes  of  the  heads  of  the  agency. 

The  agency  that  they  run  is  divided  into  three  operating  divisions  and  a 
group  of  supporting  administrative  units.  The  three  operating  divisions  are 
the  Office  of  Research  and  Development,  with  about  2,000  employees,  the 
Office  of  Communications  Security,  with  about  1,500,  and  the  Office  of  Pro- 
duction, with  more  than  7,500.  The  main  supporting  units  are  the  Office  of 
Personnel  Services,  which  recruits  and  hires,  the  Office  of  Training  Services, 
fourth  largest  unit  in  the  agency,  and  the  Office  of  Security  Services,  which 
maintains  physical  and  personnel  security,  reviewing  the  background  investi- 
gations of  prospective  employees,  giving  lie  detector  tests,  and  granting  or 
refusing,  or  revoking— security  clearances.  Smaller  supporting  units  include 
the  offices  of  the  director,  the  comptroller,  and  the  adjutant  general,  the 
inspector  general,  counsel,  and  the  library,  headed  by  Dr.  John  Sanford,  which 
has  a superb  collection  of  works  on  cryptology  and  of  up-to-date  reference 
texts  (needed  by  the  cryptanalysts  for  probable  words)  and  more  than  600 
mathematical  publications  in  English,  Chinese,  French,  German,  Portuguese, 
Russian,  and  Spanish.  At  least  once  its  copy  of  Shakespeare  served  a non- 
literary purpose  when  a cryptanalyst,  cracking  a spy  cipher,  recognized  the 
first  words  of  the  key  as  a quotation  from  the  Bard,  rushed  to  the  library,  dug 
it  out,  and  effortlessly  reduced  the  cryptogram  to  plaintext.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Without  people,  of  course,  N.S.A.  could  not  even  exist,  and  getting  and 
keeping  personnel  appears  to  be  one  of  the  chief  continuing  problems  facing 
the  agency.  This  is  the  task  of  the  Office  of  Personnel  Services. 

The  first  part  of  the  problem  is  getting  them  in.  N.S.A.  depends  heavily  on 
scientists  and  engineers.  Their  skills  are  in  short  supply,  and  competition  for 
them  is  intense.  Consequently,  N.S.A.  actively  conducts  a nationwide  recruit- 
ment program,  directed  primarily  at  young  college  graduates  because  govern- 
ment salaries  at  their  levels  do  not  differ  from  industry’s  so  markedly  as  with 
experienced  men.  Scientists  in  colleges  throughout  the  country  refer  promising 
graduates  to  N.S.A.  and  recommend  N.S.A.  to  them;  their  high  professional 
caliber  has  been  a major  factor  in  the  recruitment  program’s  success.  N.S.A. 
recruiters  tell  the  prospective  employees  about  opportunities  to  climb  either  a 
supervisory  or  a technical  career  ladder.  As  Canine  put  it,  “There  is  a marshal’s 
baton  in  each  employee’s  knapsack  when  he  starts  out” — a metaphor  that 
may  be  somewhat  felicitous  for  cryptology  in  view  of  the  story  (though  it  is 
almost  certainly  apocryphal)  that  the  skytale,  which  the  Spartan  commander 
always  wore  at  his  waist,  became  a symbol  of  authority  that  is  today  the 
swagger  stick  of  the  field  officer  and  the  baton  of  the  marshal. 

Applicants  must  pass  the  Professional  Qualification  Test  and  then  the 
eagle-eyed  scrutiny  of  a security  check.  So  rigorous  is  this  that,  despite  the 
agency’s  urgent  need  for  scientific  talent,  five  out  of  every  six  applicants  are 
rejected.  From  the  nation’s  college  graduating  classes  of  1956,  N.S.A.  hired 
between  250  and  300  young  men  and  women.  Not  all  were  scientific  or 
engineering  or  even  language  personnel.  N.S.A.  also  needs  liberal  arts  gradu- 
ates to  work  in  its  library  and  other  support  facilities.  And  the  graduate’s 
experience  need  not  be  directly  related  to  his  work,  since  the  agency  will  train 
him  for  what  it  needs.  Often  it  prefers  to  do  this — taking  a French  major,  for 
example,  and  teaching  her  Russian.  Cryptanalysis,  must,  of  course,  be  taught, 
and  one  member  of  the  Office  of  Training  Services,  Lambros  D.  Callimahos, 
is  revising  the  Friedman  Military  Cryptanalysis  texts  to  bring  them  up  to 
date. 

As  a consequence  of  this  intensive  recruitment,  many  N.S.A.ers  are  young. 
The  agency  regards  all  appointments  as  permanent,  with  no  probationary  or 
temporary  positions,  and  it  does  its  best  to  hold  its  hard-won  new  employees. 
It  arranges  excursions  to  New  York.  It  stages  hobby  shows.  In  the  evenings 
the  sedate  classrooms  of  the  N.S.A.  School,  which  during  the  day  echo  to  the 
fricative  paradigms  of  Russian  verbs  and  dry-as-dust  exercises  in  symmetry  of 
position,  resound  to  the  hot  rhythms  of  the  rhumba  and,  perhaps,  the  twist, 
as  N.S.A.ers  take  dance  courses.  Earnest  young  scientists,  who  cannot  pub- 
lish their  highly  classified  work  in  the  usual  scientific  publications,  satisfy  their 
yearnings  for  professional  recognition  by  writing  for  the  N.S.A.  Technical 
Journal. 

Yet  personnel  turnover  is  high.  Young  men  and  women  who  are  just 
finding  themselves  change  jobs.  Industry  offers  more  money.  And  always 


N.S.A. 


707 


there  is  the  oppressive  atmosphere  of  security.  Despite  the  picnics  and  the 
dances,  the  compartmentalization  of  offices  and  the  restrictions  of  movement 
tend  to  limit  the  romantic  aspirations  of  the  girls  in  their  early  twenties.  One 
girl  blamed  the  omnipresent  secrecy  for  keeping  her  from  learning  that  a man 
with  whom  she  had  a love  affair  was  married;  while  this  was  undoubtedly 
more  her  fault  than  the  agency’s,  it  does  indicate  the  resentment  that  the 
security  breeds.  And  the  threat  of  sudden,  instant  dismissal,  without  re- 
course to  a hearing  or  review  and  without  any  confrontation  of  any  person 
who  might  have  accused  the  employee,  justly  or  unjustly,  of  something 
that  the  director  feels  might  jeopardize  N.S.A.  security,  cannot  enhance 
morale. 

The  factors  that  outweigh  all  these,  however,  and  that  largely  enable 
N.S.A.  to  retain  its  staff,  are  patriotism  and  the  opportunity  to  serve.  These 
provide  spiritual  satisfactions  that  money  cannot  buy. 

The  agency  runs  itself  in  accordance  with  modern  principles  of  manage- 
ment. Its  interne  program  seeks  to  develop  civilian  employees  for  high  manage- 
ment posts.  It  promotes  from  within,  and  moves  personnel  from  post  to  post 
to  broaden  them.  It  maintains  a suggestion  program  that  pays  out  hundreds  of 
dollars  for  good  ideas.  It  offers  instruction  in  dictographs  for  supervisors, 
appraises  its  paperwork,  and  works  hard  at  keeping  itself  as  efficient  and 
streamlined  as  possible. 

The  cutting  edge  of  cryptologic  progress  in  the  United  States  is  N.S.A.’s 
Office  of  Research  and  Development,  or  R/D.  Solomon  Kullback,  one  of  the 
three  cryptanalysts  that  Friedman  hired  in  1931,  served  as  its  head  in  the 
early  1950s.  In  1957,  Howard  H.  Campaigne,  a Ph.D.  in  mathematics 
specializing  in  statistics  and  hypergroups,  became  head  of  the  mathematical 
section  at  the  age  of  47.  His  assistant  is  Dr.  Walter  W.  Jacobs,  a mathematical 
statistician  who  had  previously  served  in  the  Office  of  Production. 

R/D  is  divided  into  three  sections  called  remp,  sted,  and  rade.  remp  the 
term  stands  for  “Research,  Engineering,  Mathematics,  Physics  conducts 
basic  cryptanalytical  research.  It  ransacks  the  domains  of  statistics  and  higher 
algebra  for  ever  more  sensitive  and  more  powerful  tests  to  solve  complex 
ciphers.  It  attacks  difficult  foreign  cryptosystems  to  devise  new  techniques  of 
solution ; any  intelligence  obtained  is,  so  far  as  R/D  is  concerned,  a by-product 
of  this  search.  It  advises  other  N.S.A.  divisions  on  problems  involving  new 
methods.  It  works  intensively  to  improve  computer  applications  to  cryptology. 
Engineers  and  physicists  seek  increases  in  computer  speed  and  data-handling 
capacity  by  transistor  circuitry,  short-pulse  techniques,  time-sharing,  and 
magnetic  memories.  A recent  effort  involved  eliminating  speed-inhibiting 
factors  from  such  memories,  remp  uses  computers  to  design  computers,  and 
engineers  working  on  peripheral  components,  such  as  line  printers  and 
punched-card  inputs,  must  strain  to  keep  up  with  basic  technology.  N.S.A. 
leads  even  such  firms  as  I.B.M.  and  Remington  Rand  in  important  areas  of 


708  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

computer  development,  such  as  time-sharing,  and  industry  has  adopted  many 
N.S.A.-designed  features. 

The  second  section,  sted  (for  “Standard  Technical  Equipment  Develop- 
ment”) conducts  basic  cryptographic  research.  It  looks  for  new  principles  of 
encipherment.  It  ascertains  whether  new  developments  in  technology,  such 
as  the  transistor  and  the  tunnel  diode,  have  cryptographic  applications. 
Using  such  esoteric  tools  as  Galois  field  theory,  stochastic  processes,  and 
group,  matrix,  and  number  theory,  it  will  construct  a mathematical  model  of 
a proposed  cipher  machine  and  will  simulate  its  operation  on  a computer, 
thus  producing  the  cipher  without  having  to  build  the  hardware.  Rotor 
principles  have  often  been  tested  for  cryptographic  strength  in  this  way.  It 
devises  audio  scramblers,  from  the  ultra-secure  types  for  high  officials  to  the 
walkie-talkies  of  platoon  commanders,  as  well  as  video  scramblers  for 
reconnaissance  television  and  for  facsimile.  Their  development  involves 
sciences  from  metallurgy  to  optics,  as  well  as  techniques — important  in  min- 
iaturization— from  printed  circuits  to  ferro-resonance. 

R/D’s  third  section,  rade  (for  “Research  And  DEvelopment”),  conducts 
basic  transmission  research,  going  deeply  into  such  matters  as  the  interaction 
of  electromagnetic  radiation  and  matter.  It  aims  both  at  increasing  the  sensi- 
tivity of  American  intercepting  receivers  and  the  security  of  American  trans- 
mission methods.  N.S.A.  radios  operate  at  the  extreme  limits  of  radio  fre- 
quencies and  involve  all  types  of  electromagnetic  emanations.  Its  listening 
posts  require  both  panoramic  receivers  to  scan  the  entire  frequency  spectrum 
and  single-frequency  receivers  with  a high  degree  of  stability  that  will  not 
drift  off  a signal,  rade  strives  constantly  for  antenna  arrays  that  will  accentu- 
ate the  signal  and  eliminate  atmospheric  interference  and  circuit  noise  so  as  to 
pick  up  even  the  weakest  radio  messages.  It  improves  direction-finding  ap- 
paratus and  devises  radio  fingerprinting  apparatus.  And  it  looks  into  new 
techniques  of  communication,  such  as  methods  that  spread  a transmission 
over  so  broad  a frequency  spectrum  that  anyone  listening  on  one  frequency 
band  would  hear  only  a faint  crackle  like  static.  These  may  themselves  afford 
some  security — at  least  until  the  enemy’s  technology  catches  up.  Presumably 
it  is  investigating  the  possibility  of  sending  messages  by  laser. 

In  addition,  N.S.A.  engages  in  some  basic  communications  research  in  the 
broadest  possible  sense.  The  flow  of  impulses  through  a computer’s  circuits 
constitutes  a study  in  communication,  and  N.S.A.  mathematicians  investigate 
it.  They  use  the  tools  of  the  new  field  of  information  theory  to  look  into  other 
problems — compression  of  maximum  information  into  a minimum  band- 
width, expected  percentages  of  errors,  rates  of  transmission,  pattern  recogni- 
tion. N.S.A.  physicists  study  modern  quantum  theory  of  many-body  systems, 
superconductivity,  magnetic  resonance,  the  electromagnetic  properties  of 
solids,  and  the  scattering  effect  of  the  ionized  region  of  the  troposphere  for 
possible  application  to  communications.  Language  itself  is  dissected  phon- 
etically, phonemically,  grammatically,  logically,  semantically,  historically, 


N.S.A.

statistically,  and  comparatively.  These  studies  result  in  one  of  N.S.A.’s  few 
unrestricted  products : dictionaries  and  grammars  of  more  recondite  tongues, 
such  as  the  429-page  Vietnamese-English  Vocabulary  issued  by  the  Office  of 
Training  Services,  the  Romanian-English  Dictionary,  prepared  by  N.S.A.’s 
762  Dictionary  Unit,  and  A Grammar  of  the  Bulgarian  Language.  R/D’s 
research  differs  from  that  carried  out  by  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analyses 
Communication  Research  Division  at  Princeton  in  generally  being  rather 
more  applied  in  nature.  l.D.A.  research  is  freer,  more  “far  out.” 

Smallest  of  N.S.A.’s  three  operating  divisions — and  the  only  one  whose 
duties  are  publicly  acknowledged — is  the  Office  of  Communications  Security, 
or  comsec.  It  is  responsible  for  the  protection  of  secret  American  government 
communications.  Consequently  it  prescribes  or  approves  the  systems  each 
department  must  use  and  how  they  must  use  them.  It  furnishes  some  machines 
itself  and  lets  contracts  for  the  others.  It  promulgates  the  national  crypto- 
security doctrine  and  supervises  its  execution. 

“All  cryptographic  material  (including  cryptographic  equipment,  instruc- 
tions, spare  parts,  and  associated  materials  for  the  Armed  Forces)  is  produced 
by,  or  procured  under,  the  direction  of  N.S.A.,”  states  an  Air  Force  manual. 
The  same  must  be  true  for  the  Army,  the  Navy,  and  the  State  Department. 
comsec  standardizes  as  much  of  American  cryptography  as  practicable,  down 
to  the  short  titles  of  communications  security  publications.  Thus  the  Air  Force 
Communications  Security  Manual  2,  formerly  known  as  afcomsecm-2,  is  now 
listed  as  afkag-2.  comsec  prepares  courses  of  instruction  for  new  crypto- 
graphic equipment  and  issues  regulations  for  its  operation,  presumably 
mandating  such  matters  as  the  when  and  how  of  primary  and  secondary  key 
changes.  For  interdepartmental  and  presidential  communications,  it  probably 
produces  the  keys — rotor  wirings,  lists  of  positions,  one-time  tapes.  Keys  for 
communications  wholly  within,  say,  the  Air  Force  are  presumably  produced 
by  its  own  cryptographic  agencies. 

comsec,  drawing  upon  R/D’s  sted,  devises  new  systems  of  encipherment 
and  embodies  them  in  new  mechanisms.  It  works  closely  with  potential  users, 
such  as  the  State  Department,  to  make  sure  that  the  equipment  fits  the  user’s 
needs  and  at  the  same  time  provides  adequate  security,  comsec  engineers 
test  this  equipment  for  reliability  in  vibration  machines  and  salt-spray  cham- 
bers. They  assure  its  compatibility  with  the  user’s  existing  equipment,  and 
they  cooperate  with  the  manufacturer  to  get  the  best  devices  at  the  lowest  cost. 

In  addition  to  the  suggestions  that  contractors  make  for  improving 
machines,  comsec  evaluates  the  hundreds  of  ideas  for  new  “unbreakable 
cipher  systems  that  pour  in  upon  the  National  Security  Agency  from  amateur 
cryptographers.  The  agency  gets  at  least  one  a day,  often  channeled  to  it  from 
the  Army  or  the  F.B.I.  or  the  State  Department.  Many  are  from  professional 
men,  such  as  doctors  and  lawyers,  but  one  came  in  from  a prisoner  (it  was 
forwarded  by  his  warden).  A good  percentage  include  a challenge  message,

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


and  the  comsec  experts  can  just  visualize  the  devilish  grin  of  the  inventor  as  he 
finishes  enciphering  the  message,  and  thinks,  “They'll  never  get  that\ ” 

The  inventors  fall  into  two  categories.  One  type  has  just  read  Edgar  Allan 
Poe’s  dictum  in  “The  Gold-Bug”  that  “it  may  well  be  doubted  whether 
human  ingenuity  can  construct  an  enigma  of  the  kind  which  human  ingenuity 
may  not,  by  proper  application,  resolve,”  and  has,  in  half  an  hour,  invented 
an  unbreakable  cipher  that  disproves  it.  The  other  has  just  devised  a cipher 
so  simple  that  a 12-year-old  can  operate  it  (never  a 13-year-old),  and  as 
a patriotic  American  is  giving  it  to  his  government  for  a mere  8100,000 — 
a cheap  price  for  assuring  the  security  of  information  worth  much  more 
than  that. 

Few  of  the  inventors  have  any  idea  of  the  volume  of  modern  communica- 
tions, of  the  conditions  under  which  ciphering  is  done,  of  modern  cryptanalysis, 
or  that  the  unbreakable  cipher,  in  the  form  of  the  one-time  pad,  already 
exists.  Nearly  all  the  systems  are  pencil-and-paper,  which  are  all  but  useless 
today,  and  the  chances  are  almost  nil  that  even  a tinkerer  in  a machine  shop 
will  come  up  with  anything  new  and  worthwhile.  Nevertheless,  comsec  looks 
seriously  at  every  proposal.  It  perhaps  recalls  that  all  the  basic  cryptographic 
principles  now  in  wide  use — the  rotor,  the  Jefferson  cylinder-strip  system,  the 
one-time  tape,  the  Hagelin  mechanism — were  created  by  persons  with  no 
professional  cryptologic  background.  The  next  letter  may  come  from  a new 
Hebern,  submitting  a valuable  concept.  Besides,  it’s  fun  to  solve  the  challenge 
cryptograms — which  comsec  very  often  does,  despite  a brevity  that  would 
never  be  met  with  in  practice. 

In  a way,  however,  the  agency  seems  to  take  unfair  advantage  of  these 
inventors.  Their  ideas  disappear  into  the  black  maw  of  the  N.S.A.  and  may 
even  see  service  in  American  cryptography,  but  security  prevents  the  inventor 
from  ever  knowing  of  this — and  may  enable  the  agency  or  its  employees  to 
utilize  his  ideas  without  compensation.  Fear  of  this  may  keep  some  inventors 
from  submitting  potentially  valuable  ideas.  The  agency  might  attract  more 
suggestions  by  a firm  promise  not  to  use  ideas  without  payment;  this  might 
be  of  some  value  if  the  matter  ever  came  to  court.  But  the  agency  will  not 
give  such  a promise.  More  incomprehensibly,  it  will  not  even  say  why  it  will 
not.  It  seems  that  here  N.S.A.  is  being  deliberately  self-injurious. 

comsec  presides  over  a great  variety  of  cryptosystems.  The  Army  requires 
different  methods  for  the  differing  needs  of  front-line,  middle-echelon,  and 
high-command  communications.  The  Navy’s  needs  may  not  vary  quite  so 
widely,  but  even  it  uses  strip  cipher  for  less  important  communications  and 
rotor  machines  for  more  important  ones.  The  Air  Force  probably  uses  small 
codes  for  its  airborne  communications  and  a host  of  systems  for  its  ground 
communications,  including  those  to  the  missile-launch  centers. 

Are  American  cryptosystems  secure?  Different  agencies  investigate  this 
question  in  different  ways.  N.S.A.  tests  the  theoretical  limits  of  security  of 
ciphers.  For  example,  comsec  mathematicians  might  calculate  the  maximum 


N.S.A. 


711 


number  of  messages  that  could  be  sent  with  unchanged  primary  key  (as  the 
wiring  in  a set  of  rotors)  before  enough  secondary-key  overlaps  could  be 
expected  to  make  solution  likely.  They  use  such  information  to  prescribe  key 
changes.  The  individual  agencies  probably  test  the  practical  security  of  their 
own  systems  by  monitoring  and  actual  cryptanalysis ; the  State  Department, 
for  example,  employs  half  a dozen  cryptanalysts.  In  ad<Tiion,  independent 
tests  are  made,  as  by  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analyses.  In  one  case,  I.D.A. 
cryptanalysts  were  given  1 ,000,000  letters  of  error-free  text  in  a top  military 
cryptosystem.  They  put  in  the  equivalent  of  six  man-years  on  it — and  finally 
gave  up  in  defeat.  The  episode  speaks  well  for  the  security  of  that  cipher,  and, 
by  implication,  for  that  of  other  American  cryptosystems. 

In  a jet-age  world,  voice  communications,  with  their  speed,  convenience, 
personal  quality,  and  two-way  nature,  are  essential.  Scramblers  keep  the  con- 
versations private,  comsec’s  functions  extend  to  ciphony,  though  the  Bell 
Telephone  Faboratories  also  do  a great  deal  of  development  work. 

Scramblers  today  are  vastly  improved  over  the  old  World  War  II  models, 
mainly  because  they  employ  a new  form  of  telephony  called  “pulse  code 
modulation.”  PCM  converts  the  voice  signal  into  a sequence  of  pulses  and 
nonpulses,  somewhat  like  a teletype  signal.  The  number  of  pulses  per  second 
varies  with  voice  frequency.  This  digital  form  permits  the  interlacing  of  many 
speech  signals  within  a single  circuit,  thus  increasing  the  capacity  of  a tele- 
phone network.  While  PCM  alone  affords  some  security,  since  PCM  equip- 
ment is  needed  to  reconvert  it  to  voice  form,  its  main  cryptographic  advantage 
lies  in  the  ease  and  security  of  encipherment  in  the  digital  mode.  The  scram- 
bler can  encipher  the  sequence  of  pulses  and  spaces  just  as  in  the  Vernam 
system.  The  millions  of  key  pulses  can  be  stored  as  magnetized  spots  on 
metallized  tape,  as  light  and  dark  spots  on  film,  as  holes  in  punched  cards. 
Or  a computer  can  generate  them.  (A  million  pulses  will  last  for  two  and  one 
half  minutes  of  PCM  encipherment  at  8,000  pulses  a second.)  Though  prob- 
lems of  synchronization  afflict  PCM  systems,  they  are  highly  secure,  since 
problems  of  the  voice’s  resistance  to  distortion,  which  render  the  continuous- 
wave  scramblers  so  vulnerable,  do  not  arise. 

Because  of  this  security,  the  scrambler  that  the  State  Department  and  the 
Air  Force  use  for  their  most  secret  and  highest  priority  messages  probably 
employs  PCM.  The  price  tag  seems  to  confirm  it : almost  $100,000  per  installa- 
tion. This  is  the  ky-9.  Developed  by  the  National  Security  Agency,  it  resembles 
a four-drawer  file  cabinet.  State  has  seven  in  its  headquarters,  including  one 
in  its  Crisis  Center,  which  keeps  a round-the-clock  watch  on  world  events;  it 
has  also  installed  two  each  in  Paris  and  Geneva  offices  and  one  each  in  Fon- 
don,  Bonn,  Berlin,  Rome,  and  the  U.S.  mission  to  the  U.N.  in  New  York. 
The  Air  Force  carries  ky-9’s  in  the  flying  command  posts  that  would  control 
American  retaliatory  forces  if  its  underground  headquarters  were  wiped  out 
in  a nuclear  missile  attack.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Scrambler  work  goes  hand  in  hand  with  speech  compression,  multiplexing 
(sending  several  messages  simultaneously  over  a single  channel),  narrowing 
the  bandwidth  needed  for  radiotelephone,  and  spurt  communication  systems 
(in  which  messages  are  stored  on  tape  or  on  a fluorescent  scope  and  then  read 
off  and  transmitted  at  high  speed).  Though  these  systems  aim  primarily  at 
cramming  more  messages  into  the  increasingly  crowded  electromagnetic 
spectrum,  they  also  provide  a measure  of  security  because  only  special  equip- 
ment can  receive  them.  One  Army  system  combines  both  economy  and  security. 
It  sends  teletype  signals  on  a low  frequency  and  voice  on  a higher  one  in  the 
same  transmission.  The  harmonics  of  the  teletype  signal  spill  over  into  the 
voice  frequency,  masking  it.  The  result  sounds  something  like  a buzz  saw  with 
mutterings  partly  audible  beneath  it.  The  receiver  uses  a feedback  circuit  to 
subtract  out  the  teletype,  and  with  it  its  harmonics,  leaving  the  speech  clear. 

Compression  systems  are  no  proof  against  real  cracking,  however;  the 
teletype-voice  system  was  broken  by  a radio  ham.  For  use  in  tank  battles, 
front-line  combat,  or  raids  on  fast-moving  guerrillas,  actual  scrambler 
equipment,  employing  transistors  to  make  it  lightweight,  is  probably  being 
built  into  portable  telephone  or  radio  systems.  Heavier  and  more  complex 
scramblers,  affording  more  security,  will  be  incorporated  into  the  extensive 
communications  system  of  the  dispersed  command  post  of  the  future,  in  which 
functions  traditionally  centralized  will  be  separated  by  miles  to  minimize  the 
effects  of  an  atomic  strike.  The  Army  is  working  actively  on  this  problem  in 
the  Voice  Security  Branch  of  its  Fort  Monmouth  signal  laboratories. 

One  of  comsec’s  chief  customers  is  the  Department  of  State,  comsec 
supervises  State  cryptography  and  furnishes  or  approves  State’s  equipment, 
but  State  pays  for  this  equipment,  does  its  own  enciphering  with  its  own 
personnel,  composes  its  own  keys,  and  checks  on  its  own  operation. 

The  cryptographic  advances  made  during  World  War  II,  particularly  in 
mechanization,  benefited  the  State  Department.  The  armed  forces  supplied 
the  diplomats  with  surplus  cipher  machines  needed  for  America’s  expanding 
interests.  These  machines  handled  larger  volumes  of  traffic  than  codebooks 
could — a clerk  operating  a cipher  machine  can  turn  out  10  to  15  times  as 
much  work  as  one  using  a codebook.  Some  codebooks  remained  in  use, 
however,  particularly  at  isolated  posts,  for  economy  and  brevity.  In  the  post- 
war period,  the  Division  of  Cryptography  (established  in  1944)  remained 
“responsible  for  providing  for  the  security  of  telegraphic  communications  by 
means  of  cryptographic  systems.”  By  1961,  a Cryptography  Staff  of  31  adminis- 
tered and  operated  communications  security.  It  was  still  headed  by  its  first 
chief.  Navy  cryptanalyst  Captain  Lee  W.  Parke,  by  then  a special  assistant 
to  the  deputy  assistant  secretary  for  operations. 

During  these  years,  traffic  volume  skyrocketed.  The  telegraphic  workload 
for  all  of  1930  amounted  to  2,200,000  words.  By  January  of  1960,  State  was 
sending  and  receiving  that  quantity  every  two  weeks;  4,934,000  words  were 


N.S.A. 


713 


sent  in  that  month  alone.  The  department  attempted  to  keep  up  with  this 
flood  by  partial  automation  at  its  main  communications  center  in  the  new 
State  headquarters  building.  But  the  backbone  communications  and  crypto- 
graphic equipment  at  the  various  U.S.  embassies  and  missions  remained  of 
World  War  II  vintage,  subject  to  the  mechanical  problems  of  age  and,  in  some 
cases,  to  suspicions  about  their  security  due  to  cryptanalytic  advances.  The 
tide  of  messages  rose  faster  and  faster.  June  of  1961  saw  6,929,000  words — an 
increase  of  40  per  cent  in  just  18  months. 

In  October  of  1962,  the  Cuban  missile  crisis  broke  in  full  force  upon  the 
department’s  antiquated  network.  It  barely  coped.  While  Russian  ships 
bearing  missiles  steamed  toward  blockaded  Cuba,  dispatches  that  should  have 
passed  between  President  Kennedy  and  Premier  Khrushchev  in  minutes 
consumed  precious  hours  in  transit.  Washington  heard  of  some  of  Moscow’s 
most  important  messages  through  Russian  radio  broadcasts  hours  before 
they  were  delivered  at  the  White  House.  The  situation  glaringly  revealed  the 
inadequacies  of  American  communication.  That  very  month  the  President 
set  up  an  inter-departmental  committee  to  look  into  all  aspects  of  the  prob- 
lem. It  brought  forth  the  National  Communications  System.  Within  the  State 
Department,  the  communications  organization  was  completely  revamped  and 
equipment  was  replaced  in  wholesale  lots. 

Early  in  1963,  the  department  established  the  post  of  deputy  assistant 
secretary  for  communications  to  centralize  and  streamline  all  communica- 
tions, including  the  diplomatic  pouch  and  courier  service.  Under  him  a Com- 
munications Security  Division 

prepares  and  executes  a cryptographic  program  for  the  protection  of  classified 
and  administratively  controlled  information  electrically  transmitted.  To  carry 
out  this  program  there  is  involved  the  participation  in  the  formulation  of 
National  Communications  Security  policy,  development,  issuance  and  mainten- 
ance of  communications  security  controls,  for  both  domestic  and  overseas  com- 
munications facilities,  participation  in  the  design  and  development  of  crypto- 
graphic systems  as  to  suitability  for  the  Department’s  needs,  determination  of 
quantitative  requirements,  and  ensuring  an  adequate  supply  of  cryptographic 
material,  maintaining  the  necessary  records  therefor,  and  serves  [serving]  as  a 
primary  point  of  contact  with  representatives  of  other  governments  on  com- 
munications security  matters. 

Starting  with  seven  persons  when  it  was  first  created,  the  division  nearly 
doubled  to  13  in  1964,  and  increased  to  17  the  following  year,  thereafter 
staying  that  size.  Its  personnel  includes  cryptographers  and  cryptanalysts. 
The  cryptanalysts,  who  may  qualify  for  the  job  with  experience  in  the 
physical  sciences,  presumably  evaluate  the  department’s  cryptosystems. 
William  H.  Goodman,  a former  teacher  who  joined  State  as  a cryptographer 
in  1945  after  wartime  cryptanalytic  service  in  the  War  Department,  became 
the  first  head  of  the  division.  Unlike  the  former  Cryptography  Staff,  none  of 


714 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


its  personnel  actually  encipher  or  decipher  the  department’s  messages.  That 
work  is  handled  by  $90-a-week  code  clerks  in  the  Code  Section  of  the  Tele- 
communications Operations  Division. 

At  the  same  time,  State  was  replacing  its  outmoded  cryptographic  equip- 
ment— a move  wholeheartedly  approved  by  N.S.A.  It  began  spending  mil- 
lions of  dollars  for  new  cipher  machines  and  scramblers.  It  asked  Congress 
for  a supplemental  S3, 250, 000  for  fiscal  1964  for  new  communications 
security  equipment.  For  fiscal  1965,  its  budget  request  of  $4,500,000  for  com- 
munications improvement  made  up  almost  a quarter  of  the  $24,700,000  in- 
crease in  the  State  Department  budget.  The  cryptographic  replacement 
program  was  substantially  completed  by  1965. 

By  far  the  largest  part  of  the  $3,250,000  went  for  450  hw-28’s.  This  device 
became  State’s  basic  cipher  machine.  It  may  serve  either  as  a teletype  or  a 
“tape  coding  and  decoding”  mechanism — a one-time  tape  device — or,  in 
an  on-line  capacity,  as  both.  The  Teletype  Corporation  of  Chicago  sells  them 
to  the  department  at  $7,200  apiece,  putting  a price  tag  of  well  over  $3,000,000 
on  the  entire  installation,  which  was  to  be  spread  over  two  or  more  fiscal 
years.  Deliveries  began  about  March  of  1964. 

To  mechanize  the  manual  one-time  pad  that  must  be  used  by  consulates 
and  embassies  with  no  Marine  guards  to  protect  cryptographic  equipment, 
the  department  budgeted  $221,400  in  1964  for  50  kw-7’s.  These  on-line 
transistorized  devices,  supplied  by  comsec,  appear  to  be  small  enough  to  be 
locked  up,  like  the  pads,  and  so  not  to  require  guards.  The  per-item  cost  of 
$4,500  may  be  due  in  part  to  refinements  to  prevent  inductive  or  galvanic 
interaction  between  the  key  pulses  and  the  plaintext  pulses,  which  wiretappers 
could  detect  in  the  line  pulse  and  use  to  break  the  unbreakable  system  through 
its  back  door. 

In  1963,  State  asked  for  $82,300  for  a secure  internal  communications 
system  that  would  replace  the  manual  method  of  multilithing  copies  of  “eyes- 
only”  incoming  telegrams  and  hand-carrying  them  to  the  offices  of  the 
Secretary  of  State  and  the  assistant  secretaries  for  the  several  geographic 
regions.  Urgent  messages  were  to  be  teletyped  to  their  offices;  ten  kw-1’s  at 
$8,000  each  provided  on-line  encipherment  and  decipherment  for  secrecy 
even  though  the  messages  never  went  outside  the  State  Department  building. 
The  remaining  $2,300  went  for  terminal  switch  gear. 

In  addition,  the  department  spends  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars  each 
year  “for  the  purchase  of  variable  elements  of  cryptographic  systems, 
elements  which  must  be  changed  periodically  in  all  Foreign  Service  posts  to 
achieve  the  desired  security.”  This  expense  has  ranged  between  $50,000  and 
$100,000  in  recent  years. 

The  State  Department  employs  leased  cable  circuits  between  Washington 
and  regional  communication  centers  abroad,  such  as  its  partially  computer- 
ized center  in  Paris.  This  enables  it  to  mix  volumes  of  dummy  traffic  with  the 
real  cryptograms  (at  no  extra  cost)  so  that  any  interceptor  will  not  easily 


N.S.A. 


715 


separate  the  filler  from  the  valid  text.  Indicators,  of  course,  tell  State’s  code 
clerks  which  is  which.  So  thorough  is  the  department’s  encipherment  in  some 
of  its  traffic — presumably  the  one-time  tape  systems — that  green  operators 
in  the  cable  offices  checking  the  traffic  sometimes  think  the  circuit  is  out  of 
whack!  All  of  this,  together  with  additional  personnel,  is  making  it  possible 
for  the  department  to  handle  its  telegraphic  message  load  of  16,200,000  words 
a month — about  three  out  of  every  five  messages  being  in  code — with  speed 
and  security. 

More  and  better  scramblers  were  part  of  the  department’s  improvement 
program.  The  ky-9’s  were  ordered  before  the  program  got  under  way,  but 
older  scramblers,  costing  $75,000  each,  were  to  be  junked  and  replaced  with 
better  ones.  Their  voice  quality  was  not  good  on  long-distance  circuits,  and 
they  could  not  be  used  both  to  talk  and  listen  at  the  same  time:  a push-to-talk 
button  was  used.  As  late  as  1964,  some  posts — such  as  La  Paz,  Bolivia — had  no 
telephone  privacy  at  all.  Presumably  this  was  to  be  rectified  in  the  $1,000,000 
for  voice  equipment  provided  in  State’s  supplemental  budget  for  fiscal  1964. 
This  figure  included  48  ky-3’s  at  $10,500  each  (apparently  a lower-security 
scrambler  that  was  used  primarily  in  Washington,  including  in  the  homes  of 
a few  high  officials),  ten  kg-13’s  at  $40,000  each,  five  ky-8’s  at  $14,000 
each,  and  a ky-9  spare-parts  kit  for  $32,000.  All  were  to  be  supplied  by  N.S.A. 
They  would  also  make  possible  State’s  participation  in  an  interagency  sys- 
tem for  a worldwide  network  of  protected  voice  communication. 

Another  communications  result  of  the  Cuban  missile  crisis  was  the  long- 
talked-about  "hot  line”  between  Washington  and  Moscow.  At  Geneva  on 
June  20,  1963,  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  signed  a Memorandum 
of  Understanding  that  set  up  a duplex  cable  circuit  routed  Washington- 
London-Copenhagen-Stockholm-Helsinki-Moscow  for  primary  communica- 
tions and  a duplex  radio  circuit  routed  Washington-Tangier-Moscow  for 
service  communications  and  as  a back-up. 

“In  our  negotiations,”  wrote  Brigadier  General  George  P.  Sampson, 
deputy  director  of  the  Defense  Communications  Agency  and  chief  technical 
member  of  the  American  negotiating  team  at  Geneva,  “it  was  obviously 
recognized  early  in  the  game  that  some  steps  had  to  be  taken  to  insure  the 
privacy  of  the  communications;  and  quite  as  obviously  the  technique  to  be 
employed  would  have  to  be  one  generally  known  throughout  the  world.  It  was 
with  this  background  that  the  method  for  privacy  which  was  adopted  was 
suggested  and,  if  my  memory  serves  me  correctly,  its  first  mention  was  by  the 
U.S.  side  although  the  general  subject  had  been  alluded  to  by  both  groups.” 
This  method  was  the  one-time  tape.  Section  4 of  the  annex  to  the  memoran- 
dum stated: 

The  U.S.S.R.  shall  provide  for  preparation  and  delivery  of  keying  tapes  to 

the  terminal  point  of  the  link  in  the  United  States  for  reception  of  messages  from 

the  U.S.S.R.  The  United  States  shall  provide  for  the  preparation  and  delivery  of

terminal  points  of  the  link  shall  be  effected  through  the  Embassy  of  the  U.S.S.R. 
in  Washington  (for  the  terminal  of  the  link  in  the  U.S.S.R.)  and  through  the 
Embassy  of  the  United  States  in  Moscow  (for  the  terminal  of  the  link  in  the 
United  States). 

As  its  one-time  tape  units,  the  hot  line  employs  at  the  American  end  the 
ETCRRM  II,  or  Electronic  Teleprinter  Cryptographic  Regenerative 
Repeater  Mixer  II.  One  of  many  one-time  tape  mechanisms  sold  by  com- 
mercial firms,  it  is  produced  and  sold  for  about  $1,000  by  Standard  Telefon 
og  Kabelfabrik  of  Oslo,  the  Norwegian  subsidiary  of  International  Telephone 
and  Telegraph  Corporation,  which  installed  the  American  terminal  in  the 
National  Military  Command  Center  deep  within  the  Pentagon.  It  has  four 
teleprinters — two  with  English  alphabet  and  two  with  Russian — and  four 
associated  ETCRRM  II’s.  The  Moscow  end  is  in  the  Kremlin,  near  the 
office  of  the  Premier. 

The  hot  line  became  operative  August  30,  1963.  So  far,  it  has  transmitted 
only  hourly  test  messages : sometimes  baseball  game  scores  from  the  American 
side,  excerpts  from  Ivan  Turgenev’s  Notes  of  a Hunter  from  the  Russian.  No 
official  substantive  messages  have  passed  over  its  wires,  but  it  reportedly  was 
used  the  day  of  President  Kennedy’s  assassination.  It  remains  in  readiness,  as 
President  Kennedy  said  when  inaugurating  it,  “to  help  reduce  the  risk  of  war 
occurring  by  accident  or  miscalculation.”  The  keying  tapes  that  help  prevent 
insinuation  of  a false  message  and  assure  the  privacy  of  delicate  negotiations 
are  almost  certainly  provided  by  N.S.A.’s  Office  of  Communications  Security. 

comsec  probably  also  supplies  cryptographic  protection  for  the  one  man 
who  heads  both  the  diplomatic  and  the  military  arms  of  American  foreign 
policy.  So  awesome  are  the  President’s  responsibilities  that  his  messages  must 
be  concealed  under  the  most  profound  secrecy.  And  so  quickly  can  crises 
erupt  in  this  tinderbox  world  that  communications  must  accompany  him 
wherever  he  goes. 

The  task  of  providing  them  falls  to  the  White  House  Communications 
Agency,  a unit  of  the  Defense  Communications  Agency.  Officers  of  the  agency 
precede  the  President  and  set  up  communications  facilities  at  his  stop-over 
points.  They  also  provide  for  him  in  transit.  The  presidential  plane,  Air 
Force  One,  is  equipped  with  scramblers  and  a cipher  machine  that,  with  its 
cover  on,  resembles  a closed  typewriter.  The  President’s  automobile,  a 
specially  designed  Lincoln  Continental,  has  a scrambler  attachment  for  its 
radiotelephone.  A White  House  communications  car  follows  a few  places 
behind  the  President’s  in  motorcades.  During  President  Kennedy’s  visit 
abroad  in  1963,  a State  Department  official  in  Dublin  was  contacted  by  a 
colleague  in  Washington  in  the  midst  of  the  parade  through  cheering  crowds. 
The  President,  of  course,  has  a scrambler  in  his  office — and  its  need  is  made 


N.S.A. 


717 


clear  by  West  German  Chancellor  Konrad  Adenauer’s  report  to  his  Parlia- 
ment in  1962  that  his  telephone  was  being  tapped. 

In  addition,  a warrant  officer  carrying  the  most  important  codes  in  the 
United  States — and  perhaps  in  the  world — in  a slim  black  case  inside  a port- 
folio shadows  the  President  day  and  night.  Five  officers  alternate  the  duty, 
24  hours  a day,  every  day.  When  the  President  sleeps,  they  keep  vigil  in  the 
hall  outside  his  White  House  bedroom.  When  he  works,  they  wait  nearby. 
When  he  travels,  they  accompany  him  in  civilian  clothes.  (On  John  Kennedy’s 
yacht  Marlin,  the  officer  wore  a deckhand’s  outfit.)  They  bear  the  codes  that 
would  be  used  to  transmit  the  presidential  command  to  launch  nuclear  mis- 
siles. Primarily  authenticators,  they  assure  the  button-pusher  that  the  order  is 
bona  fide,  that  it  really  does  come  from  the  President.  So  ubiquitous  and  essen- 
tial is  this  warrant  officer  that  when  the  one  on  duty  merely  flew  in  a separate 
airplane  while  accompanying  Lyndon  Johnson  to  Detroit  on  September  7, 
1964,  it  made  news. 

These  codes  form  part  of  the  elaborate  procedure  to  ensure  that  the  firing 
command  will  get  through  at  the  critical  moment  and  that  no  false  message 
will  trigger  World  War  III.  Robert  S.  McNamara  has  declared  that  he  con- 
sidered providing  complete  control  over  nuclear  weapons  to  the  President 
alone  “my  most  solemn  obligation  as  Secretary  of  Defense.  I believe  this  has 
also  been  the  view  of  every  United  States  President,  every  Secretary  of  State 
and  every  Secretary  of  Defense  in  the  nuclear  era.”  To  get  at  least  one  copy 
of  the  message  through  despite  the  fire,  blast,  radioactivity,  and  near-total 
devastation  of  an  atomic  attack,  the  Air  Force  disperses  its  communications 
centers,  “hardens”  (fortifies)  some,  makes  others  mobile  (the  flying  command 
posts),  multiplies  the  methods  of  transmission  (solid-wire  telephone,  radio, 
teletype,  perhaps  even  radio  transmission  through  deep-rock  strata),  and 
provides  alternate  routes  within  each  form  of  transmission. 

Several  layers  of  codes  make  sure  that  only  a valid  message  gets  through. 
On  some  circuits  no  messages  may  be  transmitted  until  the  receiver  confirms 
by  authenticating  codes  that  the  message  really  comes  from  the  source  it  pur- 
ports to  be  from.  Both  sides  can  challenge  and  counterchallenge  by  secondary 
codes.  The  President  would  forge  the  first  link  in  this  chain  with  codes  pro- 
vided by  his  briefcase-carrying  officer.  Though  these  are  highly  secret,  their 
secrecy  does  not  aim  at  protecting  the  content,  for  the  message  is,  in  effect, 
known.  Rather  the  secrecy  validates,  assures,  certifies. 

The  end  link  consists  of  a 3 x 5-inch  card,  sealed  in  clear  plastic  and 
framed  in  metal,  which  the  two  launch  control  officers  wear  on  chains  around 
their  necks.  They  are  forbidden  to  take  them  off  while  they  are  on  duty  in  their 
concrete  missile-control  capsule  deep  underground.  The  message  to  go  to  war 
would  come  over  the  red  telephone  of  the  Primary  Alert  System,  which  rings 
with  a high,  warbling  whippoorwill  tone,  in  a crackly  voice  reciting  letters  in 
the  phonetic  alphabet:  “tango  mike  papa  Yankee  romeo  . . . ,”  with  a mono- 
tone “Break,  break”  after  each  group  of  five.  Both  officers  must  take  down 


718  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

the  message,  decode  it  individually,  and  confirm  each  other’s  reading  before 
commencing  the  countdown. 

Further  codes  give  the  “Go”  signal  in  the  fail-safe  system  to  manned  air- 
planes. Should  the  alert  be  sounded,  jet  bombers  of  the  Strategic  Air  Com- 
mand would  immediately  streak  toward  preassigned  targets.  But  they  may 
not  pass  a certain  point — the  “fail-safe”  point — until  they  receive  positive 
instructions.  The  code  for  these  instructions  is  kept  in  the  “red  box” — 
actually  a beige  box  with  a bright  red  door  about  18  inches  square  on  the 
wall  of  the  S.A.C.  headquarters  at  Offutt  Air  Force  Base  and  in  the  flying 
command  posts.  It  is  changed  at  random  intervals.  The  headquarters  con- 
troller would  remove  the  code  documents,  each  covering  a different  contin- 
gency, from  their  sealed  X-rayproof  “unique  device.”  The  information,  fitted 
into  the  proper  context,  is  radioed  to  the  planes,  preceded  by  verification  and 
acknowledgment.  “They  have  separate  pieces  of  the  pie,  and  we  have  the 
whole  pie,”  said  an  S.A.C.  senior  controller.  “Until  we  send  out  the  whole 
pie,  their  pieces  mean  nothing.”  Three  members  of  each  crew  must  individually 
copy  down  the  go-to-war  message,  match  this  “whole  pie”  to  the  slices  that 
each  one  carries,  and  agree  with  the  others  that  it  is  the  real  thing.  Only  then, 
according  to  the  system,  can  they  “go.”  This  is  part  of  the  overall  control 
that,  President  Johnson  has  said,  the  nation  has  imposed  to  prevent  accidental 
war.  In  it,  comsec  plays  a vital  role. 

Far  and  away  the  largest  of  N.S.A.’s  three  operating  branches  is  the 
Office  of  Production,  or  prod,  with  a little  more  than  half  of  N.S.A.’s  entire 
headquarters  personnel.  What  prod  produces  is  communications  intelligence. 
The  term  must  be  taken  in  the  broadest  possible  sense.  For  although  it  in- 
cludes cryptanalysis,  traffic  analysis,  and  analysis  of  cleartext  traffic,  it  is  not 
confined  to  studies  of  man  talking  to  man.  Communications  intelligence  in  the 
Cold  War  includes  machines  talking  to  machines — the  self-interrogations  of 
radars,  the  remote-control  systems  of  guided  missiles,  the  telemetry  of  arti- 
ficial satellites,  the  l.F.F.  or  identification-friend-or-foe  systems.  All  these 
are  communications  devices,  usually  radios  modified  in  one  way  or  another, 
and  a great  deal  can  be  learned  from  their  location  and  operation.  N.S.A. 
entered  this  electronic  field  in  the  1950s,  and  began  monitoring  Soviet  missiles 
in  1958,  the  year  after  Sputnik,  largely  due  to  the  initiative  of  prod's  Joseph 
P.  Burke,  a former  traffic  analyst. 

prod  is  always  headed  by  a military  man.  The  deputy  at  one  time  was 
Abraham  Sinkov,  one  of  Friedman's  original  three  assistants.  For  many 
years  the  office  was  divided  into  eight  sections.  Four  handled  cryptanalysis  and 
associated  traffic  analysis,  adva  (for  “ADVAnced”)  attacked  high-level 
Soviet  cipher  systems  and  diplomatic  codes,  gens  (for  “GENeral  Soviet”) 
attacked  Soviet  military  code  systems  and  medium-level  ciphers;  its  chief  at 
one  time  was  Francis  A.  Raven,  who  recovered  the  key-pattern  of  the  Japan- 
ese purple  machine  in  1941.  acom  (“Asian  COMmunist”)  attacked  the  code 


N.S.A. 


719 


and  cipher  systems  of  those  nations,  and  allo  (“ALL  Others”)  attacked  the 
cryptosystems  of  neutrals,  Communist  satellites,  and  the  nations  of  the  free 
world.  A section  called  mpro  (“Machine  PROcessing”)  provided  computer 
services  to  the  cryptanalysts.  The  section  called  Communications  handled 
the  intercept  organization.  The  two  other  sections  may  have  analyzed  clear- 
text intercepts  and  studied  the  electronic  material. 

After  Martin  and  Mitchell  exposed  this  arrangement,  however,  prod  was 
reorganized  into  three  big  sections.  These  were  set  up  on  a geographical 
basis,  and  each  analyzes  all  communications  within  its  area,  from  human 
cleartext  to  coded  mechanical  “messages.” 

To  gather  the  raw  material  for  these  sections,  N.S.A.  and  the  armed  forces 
have  cast  a fine-meshed  net  over  the  world  of  electrical  communications. 
Around  the  globe  they  have  spotted  more  than  2,000  intercept  positions  (one 
man  listening  at  one  radio  set).  Most  are  on  U.S.  military  bases  overseas,  but 
some  are  on  planes  or  aboard  ship.  More  than  8,000  soldiers,  sailors,  and 
airmen,  accompanied  and  supervised  by  N.S.A.  personnel,  type  out  on  four- 
ply  paper  the  Morse  code  messages  that  peep  incessantly  in  their  earphones. 
Other  personnel  tend  the  equipment  that  intercepts  radioteletype  messages 
and  the  tape-recorders  for  voice  communications.  Still  others  forward  the 
intercepts  to  Fort  Meade.  Interception  goes  on  around  the  clock,  at  every 
wavelength,  for  every  audible  transmission,  of  every  single  country. 

American  electronic  reconnaissance  is  carried  out  mainly  by  airplane. 
“Ferret”  airplanes  patrol  the  vast  edges  drear  of  the  Communist  world.  Their 
guts  are  packed  with  complicated  electronic  gear  for  the  use  of  their  electronic 
specialists,  called  “ravens,”  in  recording  and  analyzing  radar  signals.  The 
ferret  receivers  pose  interesting  problems  in  design.  On  the  one  hand,  they 
must  be  able  to  accept  unexpected  signals  emitted  by  new  Soviet  radars.  On 
the  other  hand,  they  must  be  able  to  measure  the  radar’s  pulse  rate  and  its 
frequency  with  great  precision.  Ideally,  they  should  always  be  ready  to  accept 
another  signal  and  not  dwell  too  long  on  the  signal  passing  through  their  cir- 
cuits. Since  no  one  receiver  can  perform  all  these  functions,  the  ferrets  must 
carry  many  types  of  receivers.  In  addition  to  simply  picking  up  the  signals, 
the  ravens  try  to  locate  their  source:  it  is  obviously  more  valuable  to  know 
that  six  new  radars  are  operating  around  a region  north  of  Moscow  than 
just  somewhere  in  Russia. 

All  signals  are  not  always  heard.  The  ferrets  may  not  be  in  range.  The 
ravens  may  not  be  operating  the  right  equipment.  The  Russians  may  have 
turned  some  radars  off  so  as  not  to  show  all  their  cards.  To  tease  one  another 
into  turning  on  some  of  their  silent  and  probably  special  ones,  nations  could 
direct  a squadron  of  bombers  at  the  enemy’s  territory  on  a mock  raid.  One 
can  imagine  the  flurry  of  electronic  activity  that  would  be  created  if  a dozen 
Soviet  bombers  headed  toward  the  United  States.  Though  this  dangerous 
game  is  not  played  by  the  two  great  powers,  a modification  of  it  is.  In- 
dividual six-jet  RB-47  ferrets  fly  dangerously  close  to  the  Soviet  frontiers  and 


720 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


sometimes  actually  cross  them — though  such  practices  are  of  course  denied 
by  the  United  States  government.  Russian  fighters  and  antiaircraft  rockets 
attack  and  sometimes  down  them.  Thus  international  incidents  result. 

Such  was  the  case  of  the  RB-47  shot  down  on  July  1,  1960,  in  the  arctic 
waters  of  the  Barents  Sea,  killing  four  of  its  six-man  crew.  The  Soviet  Union 
protested  in  the  United  Nations  that  the  aircraft  had  violated  Russia’s 
territorial  rights — a charge  that  the  United  States  denied.  Later  the  newly 
elected  President  Kennedy  negotiated  the  release  of  navigator  Captain  John 
McKone  and  co-pilot  Captain  Bruce  Olmstead.  Perhaps  the  best-known 
penetration  flight  of  all  was  that  of  Francis  Gary  Powers,  whose  U-2,  like  all 
those  that  had  preceded  his,  carried  “black  boxes”  that  recorded  Soviet 
radar  signals  on  magnetic  tape  for  analysis  by  N.S.A. 

The  Soviets  engage  in  electronic  reconnaissance,  too.  They  send  their 
TU-16  Badgers  day  after  day  against  the  American  radar  picket  fence  in 
Canada’s  far  north  called  the  DEW  (Distant  Early  Warning)  Line.  They 
depend  more  heavily,  however,  upon  their  trawlers.  Most  of  the  3,000  ships 
of  Russia’s  fishing  fleet  that  regularly  ply  the  waters  of  the  North  Atlantic  are 
legitimate,  but  almost  90  during  some  major  American  exercises  in  1961  were 
getting  their  best  catch  from  the  airwaves.  The  trawlers  often  roam  the  fish- 
poor  but  intelligence-rich  waters  off  Cape  Kennedy.  Before  a missile  firing, 
tracking  and  guidance  radars  must  be  checked,  communication  links  tested, 
telemetry  circuits  energized.  All  these  give  the  Russian  eavesdroppers  a good 
picture  of  what  is  going  on.  The  trawlers  also  lurk  near  the  Army  signal 
center  at  Fort  Monmouth,  New  Jersey.  Their  appearance  off  the  New  England 
coast  once  caused  a slowdown  of  experimental  radar  tests  at  M.I.T.'s  Lincoln 
Laboratory  in  Lexington,  Massachusetts. 

The  most  sophisticated  and  most  secret  reconnaissance  and  intercept  tools 
that  serve  N.S.A.  are  the  satellites  that  eavesdrop  upon  communications. 
These  are  a subseries  in  the  samos  (for  “Satellite  And  Missile  Observation 
System”)  satellites,  other  subseries  of  which  photograph  and  televise  the 
pictures  of  missile  bases,  encampments,  and  the  like.  The  ferret  satellite  hears 
the  faint  whisperings  of  Communist  radios  and  radars  as  it  orbits  high  over 
the  windy  steppes.  Its  sensors,  developed  by  Lockheed  Aircraft  Corporation 
and  R.C.A.,  can  tap  microwave  telephone  links  and  can  pick  up  the  radio 
guidance  signals  of  missile  launch  sites.  When  commanded  by  a signal  from 
the  ground,  its  tape  recorders  spew  out  these  signals  in  what  is  probably  an 
incredibly  compressed  spurt  of  information  to  a waiting  ground  station.  With 
the  attached  second-stage  Agena  rocket,  samos  satellites  stand  22  feet  tall  and 
5 feet  in  diameter;  they  weigh  4,100  pounds,  and  circle  the  globe  upright  like  a 
giant  cigar,  carrying  a 300-to-400-pound  instrument  package.  The  Soviets 
have  their  own  cosmos  spy  satellite,  which  probably  includes  a ferret 
series. 

The  information  collected  by  ferrets  constitutes  electronic  intelligence. 
The  detection  of  a cluster  of  radars  in  a remote  part  of  Siberia  may  indicate  the 


N.S.A. 


721 


presence  of  a Soviet  rocket  base.  The  operating  parameters  of  a radar — its 
“electronic  signature” — can  disclose  its  function — a search,  height-finder,  or 
target-guidance  radar,  for  example.  Analysis  of  Russian  telemetry  signals  may 
yield  important  details  about  rocket  instrumentation.  But  most  of  this  electron- 
ic intelligence  is  studied  to  find  ways  of  tlfwarting  Soviet  radars  that  would 
detect  and  locate  U.S.  bombers  or  missiles  and  direct  their  destruction. 
These  ways  are  called  electronic  countermeasures,  or  E.C.M.’s.  The  electronic 
security  that  defends  against  enemy  E.C.M.’s  comprises  emission  security, 
which  defends  against  electronic  reconnaissance,  and  electronic  counter- 
countermeasures, or  E.C.C.M.’s.  In  operation,  E.C.M.’s  and  E.C.C.M.'s  are 
so  intimately  intertwined  and  mutually  reliant  that  the  whole  field  of  electronic 
security  and  electronic  intelligence  is  usually  considered  under  the  general 
heading  of  “electronic  warfare.” 

Electronic  warfare  began  in  World  War  II,  when  radar  itself  first  emerged; 
in  fact,  the  astonishing  employment  of  electronics  is  one  of  the  most  notable 
features  of  that  struggle.  Winston  Churchill,  who  was  intimately  involved 
with  the  warfare  of  these  invisible  radiations  during  the  Battle  of  Britain, 
gave  it  the  grandiloquent  name  of  “The  Wizard  War.”  “This  was  a secret 
war,”  he  wrote,  “whose  battles  were  lost  or  won  unknown  to  the  public,  and 
only  with  difficulty  comprehended,  even  now,  by  those  outside  the  small  high 
scientific  circles  concerned.  No  such  warfare  had  ever  been  waged  by  mortal 
men.”  It  was  vital.  “Unless  British  science  had  proved  superior  to  German, 
and  unless  its  strange  sinister  resources  had  been  effectively  brought  to  bear 
on  the  struggle  for  survival,  we  might  well  have  been  defeated,  and,  being 
defeated,  destroyed.”  One  of  its  battles  was  that  of  the  knickbein,  a German 
navigational  beam  whose  two  sections  crossed  over  British  cities  and  which 
the  British  scientists  twisted  so  that  the  Luftwaffe  bombers  unloaded  most  of 
their  high  explosive  during  the  Battle  of  Britain  into  empty  fields  and  the 
Channel. 

Later  the  British  carried  the  Wizard  War  to  the  enemy.  Radar,  of  course, 
operates  by  emitting  pulses  of  radio  energy  which  bounce  off  objects,  such  as 
airplanes,  and  return  to  the  radar  unit.  The  direction  from  which  these  echoes 
come  gives  the  location  of  the  object.  And  since  radio  waves  travel  at  the 
constant  speed  of  light,  the  radar  unit  can  determine  the  distance  of  the 
object  by  measuring  the  interval  between  the  transmission  of  the  radar  pulse 
and  the  reception  of  its  echo.  The  British  soon  discovered  that  a strip  of  metal 
cut  to  half  the  length  of  a radar  wavelength  would  return  a much  stronger 
echo  than  an  untuned  mass  of  metal,  such  as  an  aircraft.  If  these  strips  were 
dropped  like  chaff  from  airplanes,  they  would  form  an  electronic  smoke- 
screen behind  which  British  bombers  could  dispense  death  and  destruction 
undisturbed  by  German  night  fighters  and  antiaircraft  fire.  Britain  first  tried 
this  chaff,  codenamed  window,  in  a raid  on  Hamburg  July  24,  1943.  “Its 
effects  surpassed  expectations,”  Churchill  said.  “For  some  months  our  bomber 
losses  dropped  to  nearly  half.”

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


After  the  war,  as  aircraft  flew  faster  and  guided  missiles  became  common, 
radar,  which  alone  could  give  sufficient  warning  of  an  attack,  became  in- 
creasingly important.  So,  then,  did  electronic  warfare.  Three  technical 
developments  intensified  it:  the  transistor,  which  greatly  lightened  the  recon- 
naissance equipment,  giving  planes  greater  range  and  allowing  additional 
and  more  sensitive  equipment  to  be  carried;  the  traveling  wave  tube,  which 
permitted  rapid  tuning  over  a broad  frequency  band;  and  the  maser,  which 
vastly  increased  receiver  sensitivity.  Today  electronic  warfare  accounts  for 
most  of  the  huge  defense  electronics  industry  and  costs  the  taxpayers  well 
over  half  a billion  dollars  a year  for  research,  development,  and  production — 
to  say  nothing  of  the  operation  of  the  equipment. 

The  tape  recordings  and  the  photographs  of  cathode-ray  tubes  that  the 
ferrets  bring  back  are  subject  in  N.S.A.  to  intense  analysis.  This  determines 
such  radar  operating  parameters  as  frequency,  type  of  modulation,  pulse  rate, 
pulse  shape,  power,  type  of  scan,  antenna  rotation  rate,  and  polarization.  This 
information  enables  engineers  to  design  techniques  to  blind  or  trick  enemy 
radars. 

The  earliest  and  simplest  E.C.M.  was  chaff.  Modern  radars  winnow  it  out 
without  much  difficulty,  largely  because  airplanes  fly  much  faster  than  the 
drifting  cloud  of  metal  strips.  To  counter  this,  bombers  fire  rockets  packed 
with  chaff  to  explode  well  ahead  of  them  to  confuse  the  radars.  Another 
E.C.M.  uses  decoys  that  enhance  the  radar  echo,  thus  make  the  decoys  appear 
larger  on  the  radar  scope  than  they  really  are,  and  so  trick  the  operator  into 
tracking  them  instead  of  the  real  bombers.  One  such  device  is  the  corner 
reflector.  Its  three  metal  plates  are  set  at  right  angles  to  one  another,  and  the 
corner  formed  by  them  returns  a stronger  echo  than  a flat  surface.  Another 
device  is  the  Luneberg  lens,  a sphere  that  focuses  a lot  of  radar  energy  onto  a 
small  surface  that  reflects  it  all  back.  One  lens  of  12  inches  diameter  produces 
a radar  echo  equivalent  to  a target  with  a cross  section  of  700  square  feet.  A 
swarm  of  them  on  decoy  “penetration  aids”  accompanying  an  intercontinen- 
tal ballistic  missile  could  swamp  out  the  enemy  radar  defense,  making  it 
almost  impossible  for  it  to  discriminate  the  warhead  and  direct  its  antimissile 
missiles  against  it. 

Diametrically  opposed  to  the  decoy  technique  are  the  materials  that  make 
an  object  invisible  to  radar.  One  kind  is  a two-and-a-half-inch  thick  sandwich 
of  foam  plastic.  It  absorbs  and  dissipates  the  radar  energy,  somewhat  in  the 
way  that  soundproofing  material  works.  Since  missiles  can  hardly  be  encased 
in  this  spongy  material,  they  may  use  a special  ceramic  whose  inner  surface  is 
lined  with  the  radar-absorbent  stuff. 

These  are  all  passive  countermeasures.  Active  E.C.M.'s  become  much  more 
sophisticated,  although  the  simplest  is  crude — jamming.  Jamming  has  the 
great  advantage  of  disrupting  much  radar  function.  It  does  not  require  very 
much  power,  since  the  radar  echo  is  so  weak  that  it  takes  very  little  effort  to 
overcome  it.  Modern  radars  can  defeat  jamming  to  an  extent,  however,  by 


N.S.A. 


723 


the  E.C.C.M.  called  “integration.”  The  returns  from  several  sweeps  of  the 
radar  beam  are  piled  up  on  the  scope  until  eventually  the  combined  pips 
from  the  target  become  strong  enough  to  stand  out  even  against  the  back- 
ground of  noise.  Jamming’s  real  disadvantage  is  that  it  often  disrupts  one’s 
own  radars  and  radios  and  prevents  interception  of  valuable  enemy  com- 
munications. 

Another  active  E.C.M.,  the  multiple- target  generator,  emits  many  fake 
returns.  On  the  scope  of  the  enemy  radar  will  appear  a whole  flock  of  blips, 
confusing  the  operator,  who  will  not  be  able  to  pick  out  the  true  return  from 
the  many  false  ones.  A third  active  E.C.M.  forces  a precision  radar  that  has 
locked  on  to  a target  to  “de-acquire”  it.  The  target  transmits  a false  timing 
signal  that  disrupts  the  radar’s  function  and  prevents  it  from  tracking  him. 

These  three  active  E.C.M.’s  are  confusion  techniques.  They  have  the  dis- 
advantage that  the  enemy  knows  he  is  being  confused.  Subtlest  of  all  E.C.M.'s 
are  the  deception  techniques,  which  trick  the  enemy  without  his  being  aware 
of  it.  These  usually  rely  upon  two  radar  characteristics — that  a target  will 
sense  that  it  is  being  “illuminated”  by  a radar  long  before  the  echoes  are 
strong  enough  to  return  to  the  radar,  and  that  radars  usually  follow  the 
strongest  echo.  One  deception  technique  sends  out  a strong  fake  echo  timed 
to  reach  the  radar  earlier  or  later  than  the  true  echo.  The  radar  will  thus 
show  a target  much  nearer  or  farther  from  it  than  the  attackers  really  are. 
Another  technique  produces  a false  target  moving  at  a false  speed  on  the 
radar  scope.  Radars  that  depend  on  a Doppler  shift  to  determine  target  speed 
can  be  tricked  by  E.C.M.’s  that  adjust  their  frequencies  to  indicate  a false 
Doppler  shift,  showing  a target  moving  more  slowly  than  the  real  one  is,  or 
perhaps  not  moving  at  all. 

Fighting  these  techniques  are  emission  security  and  electronic  counter- 
countermeasures, or  E.C.C.M.’s.  Radars  can  be  made  to  respond  only  to  a 
particular  wave  shape.  They  can  shift  frequency  rapidly  and  irregularly,  or 
change  their  pulse  rates  unpredictably.  These  constitute  a kind  of  electronic 
code  which  the  attackers  would  have  to  break.  Electronic  warfare  has  even 
invaded  the  infrared.  Antimissile  missiles  that  home  in  on  their  targets  by  the 
heat  of  the  exhaust  can  be  decoyed  by  extremely  hot  flares. 

In  an  actual  strike,  a B-58  loaded  with  countermeasures  equipment  instead 
of  explosives  will  convoy  the  attacking  bombers  to  fight  off  the  enemy  with 
electronic  bullets.  The  electronic  warfare  officer  decides  when  to  fire  the  varied 
weapons  at  his  disposal.  As  he  approaches  the  enemy  radar  limits  and  senses 
its  illumination,  he  emits  false  range  and  speed  data.  With  closer  penetration, 
he  launches  chaff  rockets  and  reflectors  and  generates  multiple  targets  to 
deny  information  to  the  enemy.  As  the  squadron  nears  the  target  area,  he 
busily  eyeballs  his  scopes  and  listens  in  his  earphones  for  signal  characteristics 
indicating  that  the  precision  radars  have  locked  on  to  him.  When  they  do, 
he  pulls  every  trick  in  the  book  to  nullify  their  threat.  Alter  determining  their 
frequencies  and  pulse  rates,  he  confuses  the  missile-control  radars  and  jams 


724 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


their  instructions  to  their  missiles.  He  sends  out  small  but  big-looking  decoys. 
In  a few  hectic  minutes  he  must  shelter  his  squadron  under  an  impervious 
electronic  canopy  and  shield  it  from  the  enemy  radiations  that  can  be  as  lethal 
to  his  mates  as  death  rays.  Upon  him  may  rest  the  very  success  or  failure  of 
the  mission. 

Not  all  the  human  communications  that  N.S.A.  studies  are  coded.  Into  the 
headquarters  building  at  Fort  Meade  come  recordings  of  the  cleartext  chatter 
between  Soviet  pilots.  An  N.S.A.  section  transcribes  these,  not  into  ordinary 
Russian  writing,  but  into  a phonetic  representation  that  retains  the  pronunci- 
ation variations  of  the  speakers.  These  transcription  sheets  go  to  analysts  in 
another  section.  They  compare  the  pilots’  inflections  with  known  dialectical 
pronunciations  to  determine  where  the  men  in  a squadron  come  from.  Long 
residence  in  one  locality  will  sometimes  shade  an  older  pronunciation  more 
toward  the  local  one;  the  analysts  can  detect  this  and  tell  where  the  squadron 
is  stationed.  Slang  and  current  phraseology  assists  in  these  determinations. 
When  one  pilot  calls  another  “Ivan,”  and  Ivan  replies,  the  characteristics  of 
his  speech  are  carefully  noted  in  an  enormous  file  with  all  other  Ivans  so  that 
future  clues  can  be  fitted  into  the  original  ones  to  add  more  details.  Jokes, 
comments  about  superior  officers,  references  to  nearby  units,  remarks  about 
the  planes,  all  are  catalogued.  Sometimes  an  analyst  will  spend  days  on  a 
single  sentence,  checking  and  cross-checking  names  and  intonations.  And  just 
as  the  tens  of  thousands  of  points  of  pure  color  that  Georges  Seurat  dabbed 
individually  onto  his  canvas  combined  into  the  huge  and  stately  “Sunday  on 
the  Grand  Jatte,”  so  the  thousands  of  details  elucidated  by  the  analysts  build 
up  into  a broad  image  of  Soviet  air  power,  fuzzier  than  the  painting,  of  course, 
but  with  a great  deal  of  collateral  intelligence  on  capability,  morale,  eq  uipment, 
and  almost  every  subject  which  a potential  adversary  might  find  of  interest. 

But  the  National  Security  Agency  produces  its  most  valuable  intelligence 
by  breaking  foreign  codes  and  ciphers.  And  though  “practical  cryptanalysis” 
sometimes  helps,  most  of  the  results  come  from  true  cryptanalysis.  As  Martin 
and  Mitchell  said:  “Successes  obtained  by  the  National  Security  Agency  in 
reading  the  code  and  cipher  systems  of  other  nations  are  due  primarily  to  the 
skillfulness  of  cryptanalysts,  frequently  aided  by  electronic  digital  computers.” 

Who  are  the  cryptanalysts,  and  how  many  does  N.S.A.  have?  It  is  difficult 
to  give  an  exact  answer,  because  modern  cryptanalysis  is  so  specialized  and 
so  subdivided  that  many  N.S.A.  employees  engage  in  partial  or  elementary 
cryptanalysis,  or  do  the  nearly  mechanical  task  of  filling  in  the  holes  after  the 
“real”  cryptanalysts  have  made  the  entry  into  a code  or  cipher  and  have  thor- 
oughly broken  it.  However,  a rough  guess  might  place  the  number  of  “real” 
cryptanalysts  in  N.S.A. — those  who  attack  unknown  or  new  systems — at 
about  200. 

Despite  the  great  secrecy  surrounding  their  work,  and  the  great  events  that 
can  flow  from  it,  the  cryptanalysts’  labors  resemble  those  of  any  other  office 


N.S.A. 


725 


workers.  At  N.S.A.,  they  arrive  in  one  of  three  shifts,  beginning  at  7 : 20,  7:40, 
or  8:00  a.m.  (and  ending  respectively  at  3:50,  4: 10,  and  4:30  p.m.).  Once  in, 
the  first  order  of  business  must  be  to  finish  reading  the  newspaper  and  shoot 
the  breeze  with  one’s  officemates.  When  they  get  down  to  work,  they  write 
on  cross-ruled  paper  with  colored  pencils,  shuffle  pages,  look  for  significant 
patterns,  look  for  plaintext,  confer  with  colleagues,  take  coffee  breaks.  Some- 
times a yelp  of  joy  will  pierce  the  concentration  as  a cryptanalyst  breaks 
through.  They  have  one  advantage  at  least  over  workers  in  more  ordinary 
fields:  they  cannot  take  their  work  home  with  them  at  night.  But,  in  another 
sense,  they  cannot  get  away  from  it,  for  a problem  in  cryptanalysis  grips  the 
mind,  teases  and  torments  it  more  than  other  problems,  and  never  seems  to 
let  go.  If  an  idea  occurs  at  home,  the  cryptanalyst  may  write  a note  to  himself, 
or,  if  he  lives  close  enough,  he  might  perhaps  drive  down  to  the  headquarters 
building  to  work  on  it. 

As  in  other  large  white-collar  organizations,  they  probably  work  in  large 
open  offices.  Into  them  come  the  raw  intercepts — no  doubt,  in  most  cases,  the 
typewritten  copies  as  made  on  four-ply  paper  by  the  intercept  operators. 
Urgent  messages  are  most  likely  forwarded  by  radio,  as  the  magic  intercepts 
were  sent  to  Washington  from  the  Philippines.  If  several  versions  of  the  same 
message,  picked  up  by  several  intercept  operators,  reach  Fort  Meade,  editors 
will  try  to  clear  any  garbles.  Presumably  traffic  analysts  then  collate  and  com- 
pare sender  location,  routings,  and  indicators.  This  enables  them  to  sort  the 
messages  into  families  of  identical  cipher  systems  for  the  cryptanalysts.  And 
by  studying  traffic  patterns,  they  can  deduce  tables  ot  military  organization 
and  perhaps  other  information  as  well. 

The  cryptanalysts  work  in  teams.  Complex  modern  ciphers  have  rendered 
individual  work  as  much  a thing  of  the  past  in  cryptanalysis  as  in  other 
branches  of  science.  Thirty-three  atomic  physicists  signed  the  report  an- 
nouncing the  discovery  of  the  omega-minus  particle;  seemingly  as  many 
N.S.A.  cryptanalysts  would  deserve  credit  for  solving  the  rotor  system  of  a 
sophisticated  modern  nation. 

The  head  of  the  team  apparently  parcels  out  such  assignments  as  different 
statistical  tests,  calls  conferences,  decides  whether  one  attack  is  proving  more 
fruitful  than  another.  The  cryptanalysts’  work  consists  in  essence  of  looking 
for  textual  patterns  that  deviate  significantly  from  what  could  be  expected  by 
chance.  These  patterns  are  extremely  tenuous,  and  the  individual  letters  of 
which  they  are  composed  recur  only  at  extremely  long  intervals.  This  results 
from  the  efforts  of  rotor  systems,  Hagelin  machines,  and  computer-generated 
keys  to  make  it  as  hard  as  possible  for  the  cryptanalyst  to  assemble  the  mon- 
alphabetically  enciphered  letters  that  he  must  have  to  reach  a solution.  Only 
enormous  quantities  of  text  can  make  these  faint  patterns  visible,  and  only 
huge  data-processing  computers  can  engorge  the  rivers  of  letters  and  test 
the  innumerable  possibilities  to  solve  the  system  in  real  time,  which  is  to 
say  before  it  has  lost  its  usefulness.  For  computer  processing,  key-punch 


726  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

operators  very  likely  punch  the  messages  on  cards,  and  technicians  feed  the 
cards  into  the  computers. 

N.S.A.  probably  has  more  computer  equipment  than  any  other  installation 
in  the  world.  Some  of  those  it  reportedly  has  are  general-purpose  computers, 
such  as  the  l.B.M.  Stretch,  one  of  the  world’s  fastest  and  most  powerful  com- 
puters, the  $2,898,000  l.B.M.  7090,  which  can  perform  229,000  additions  per 
second,  and  late-model  Univacs;  there  is  also  the  Atlas,  which  N.S.A.  had 
built  to  its  own  specifications  early  in  the  1950s,  and  probably  several  smaller 
general-purpose  computers.  The  agency  also  has  a great  deal  of  special  com- 
puter equipment.  For  example,  a device  may  be  built  to  run  the  kappa  test 
instead  of  wasting  a general-purpose  computer  on  so  restricted  a task.  N.S.A. 
may  use  its  computers  to  determine  which  configuration  of  possible  displace- 
ments on  a rotor  produces  the  group  of  letters  that  most  closely  resembles 
plaintext.  The  giant  calculators  may  solve  or  partially  solve  the  equations  of 
group  theory  needed  in  analyzing  a rotor  machine.  They  may  run  test  de- 
cipherments, simulating  rotors  wired  in  various  ways  and  turning  in  various 
periods,  and  print  out  the  test  solutions  at  rates  up  to  600  lines  per  minute, 
starring  those  solutions  that  statistically  most  resemble  plaintext.  Undoubt- 
edly the  agency  has  prepared  and  debugged  programs  for  common  routines 
and  holds  them  in  readiness  for  immediate  use. 

The  computer  has  in  no  way  conferred  total  victory  upon  cryptanalysis  in 
its  unending  struggle  with  cryptography,  for  cryptography  has  kept  pace  with 
countervailing  developments  of  its  own.  Nor  has  the  computer  automated  the 
cryptanalyst  out  of  a job.  The  computer  has  relieved  him  of  much  drudgery, 
but  modern  cryptosystems  involve  much  more  work  than  older  ciphers. 
Computers  could  be  programmed  to  recognize  plaintext  by  stocking  their 
memories  with  letter  frequencies,  10,000  common  words,  and  basic  gram- 
matical rules.  But  it  could  not  do  so  as  quickly  as  a human  being.  Further- 
more, the  computer  would  have  to  run  through  all  of  even  the  better  possi- 
bilities in  a modified  “brute-force”  attack — something  which  would  take  im- 
possibly long.  A human  being  can  correct  and  enlarge  partial  solutions.  And 
there  is  no  machine  yet  devised  that  can,  as  quickly  as  the  living  computer 
inside  the  skull,  make  an  inspired  guess  on  the  basis  of  a half-forgotten  news 
item  in  the  Washington  Post  of  a month  ago  and  last  night’s  television  news 
that  the  formless  mess  of  letters  i-go-e-ia  must  be  a garbled  Indonesia.  Finally, 
and  above  all,  a human  brain  must  decide  which  tests  the  computer  should 
run  on  a sheaf  of  cryptograms.  Cryptanalysis  still  has  room — indeed,  may 
have  more  room  than  ever  before — for  flair,  intuition,  experience,  individual 
brilliance.  The  computers  at  N.S.A.  are — as  they  are  wherever  computers  are 
used — the  tools  of  their  operators,  not  their  replacements.  They  are  robot 
cryptanalysts  to  a very  limited  degree.  Thus,  in  the  last  half  of  the  twentieth 
century,  in  the  flowering  of  the  computer  age,  cryptanalysis  often  comes 
down  to  exactly  the  same  problem  that  four  centuries  earlier  faced  the  West's 
first  great  cryptanalyst,  Giovanni  Soro  of  Venice:  Does  x stand  for  a or  o? 


N.S.A. 


727 


The  quality  of  the  systems  N.S.A.  attacks  varies  greatly  from  country  to 
country.  Competence  in  cryptology,  as  in  other  fields  of  endeavor,  seems  to 
vary  in  direct  proportion  to  the  technological  knowledge  and  the  economic 
wealth  of  a country.  On  this  basis,  the  United  States  probably  has  the  most 
secure  cryptosystems  and  the  most  informative  communications  intelligence 
in  the  world.  Of  the  nations  whose  cryptograms  N.S.A.  attempts  to  solve, 
unquestionably  the  most  sophisticated  must  be  the  Soviet  Union,  Great 
Britain,  and  France,  probably  in  that  order. 

In  all  probability,  N.S.A.  attempts  to  solve  all  cryptosystems  of  all 
countries — at  least  in  principle.  But  manpower  and  monetary  limitations 
afflict  N.S.A.  like  other  agencies,  and  these  and  the  incessant  emergencies  that 
must  require  pulling  a cryptanalyst  off  his  regular  task  make  the  ideal  un- 
attainable. Thus,  though  N.S.A.  might  want  to  attack,  for  example,  the 
middle-echelon  military  systems  of  a Near  Eastern  country,  it  might  have  to 
concentrate  the  cryptanalysts  that  would  be  assigned  to  it  on  a Russian  system 
that  could  be  expected  to  yield  more  valuable  results.  How  long  it  will  keep  a 
team  working  upon  a system  probably  depends  upon  the  information  it  thinks 
it  will  obtain.  The  agency  may  well  keep  a team  examining  cryptograms  in  a 
given  system  for  two  or  three  years,  even  though  it  has  had  no  success,  in  the 
hope  that  one  of  the  cipher  clerks  may  some  day  blunder  and  open  the  way  to 
a solution.  For  in  modern  systems,  properly  used  and  with  frequent  key 
changes,  a cryptographer’s  error  is  the  cryptanalyst’s  only  hope.  And  when 
nations  will  pay  their  code  clerks  only  $60  a week,  as  Italy  did  in  Washington 
in  the  1960s,  to  await  such  errors  may  not  be  pointless. 

In  addition  to  the  general  cryptanalytic  effort,  N.S.A.  may  mount  special 
attacks  if  one  of  its  customers  requests  it.  The  State  Department,  for  example, 
may  request  such  a solution  in  advance  of  a high-ranking  official’s  visit  to 
another  country  or  before  a major  diplomatic  conference. 

N.S.A.  cryptanalysts  probably  solve  foreign  cryptosystems  in  degrees  of 
completeness  that  range  from  total  reading  of  all  messages  in  a given  system, 
to  fairly  full  solutions  with  a few  questionable  patches,  to  partial  solutions 
with  many  holes,  to  solutions  in  which,  say,  one  or  two  rotors  of  several  have 
been  reconstructed  but  no  plaintext  has  been  read,  to  an  absolute  blank. 
Solutions  probably  also  vary  in  time:  the  cryptanalysts  may  read  a compli- 
cated system  for  a few  months,  then  lose  out  again  in  a change  of  key. 

The  solutions  must  go  to  organizations  in  the  U.S.  government  that 
require  that  information — military  details  to  the  Defense  Department, 
diplomatic  to  State,  and  so  on.  These,  together  with  the  C.I.A.,  must  be 
N.S.A.’s  chief  customers.  Probably  each  class  of  messages  has  a distribution 
list.  Individual  messages  may  well  be  read  at  meetings  of  the  National  Security 
Council  and  the  U.S.  Intelligence  Board.  During  the  Korean  War,  the  White 
House  itself  reportedly  called  for  solutions,  even  though  some  were  frag- 
mentary. Currently,  the  President  sees  the  N.S.A.  “Black  Book”  every  morn- 
ing, brought  to  him  by  his  military  aide. 


728  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

What  does  it  all  consist  of?  How  successful  is  N.S.A.,  and  how  valuable 
are  its  results? 

It  is  likely  that  N.S.A.  reads  only  a small  minority  of  the  total  volume  of 
intercepts  sent  it — perhaps  under  10  per  cent.  In  peacetime,  encipherers  can 
work  more  slowly  and  more  accurately  than  in  war — yet  even  in  the  wartime 
conditions  of  the  Russian  front,  with  a great  volume  of  messages  and  un- 
questionably many  more  errors,  Germany’s  Army  Group  North  solved  less 
than  30  per  cent  of  Russian  military  cryptograms.  Moreover,  the  N.S.A. 
intercept  posts  probably  concentrate  on  messages  in  the  highest  priority 
systems,  yet  these  must  be  the  best  systems  and  must  often  resist  solution, 
thus  lowering  N.S.A.’s  average. 

Nevertheless,  N.S.A.  does  solve  enough  cryptograms  to  produce  informa- 
tion of  great  value  to  the  nation.  Martin  and  Mitchell  delineated  the  extent 
of  N.S.A.  success.  The  agency,  they  said,  solved  the  codes  of  more  than  40 
nations — or  just  about  half  of  all  that  there  were  when  they  spoke.  Asked 
which  ones,  Martin  replied:  “Italy,  Turkey,  France,  Yugoslavia,  the  United 
Arab  Republic,  Indonesia,  Uruguay— that’s  enough  to  give  a general  picture, 
I guess.”  This  range  is  remarkable.  France  is  one  of  the  world’s  great  powers 
and  has  a long  and  strong  cryptologic  tradition.  It  stands  as  an  American  ally 
in  the  free  world,  as  do  the  other  major  European  country  (Italy),  the  small 
Latin  American  country  (Uruguay),  and  the  neighbor  of  Russia  (Turkey). 
Indonesia  and  the  U.A.R.  are  both  important  neutrals  in  the  Cold  War. 
Yugoslavia  is  a renegade  Communist  country.  The  two  defectors  would  not 
say  whether  the  United  States  reads  Soviet  messages.  But  the  Soviet  pre- 
dilection for  the  one-time  pad  in  diplomatic  messages,  and  its  known  cryp- 
tologic sophistication,  make  it  most  unlikely,  except  by  a lucky  accident. 
Hamilton,  the  Arab,  filled  in  some  details  of  the  Martin-Mitchell  outline: 

I was  listed  as  an  expert  on  the  Near  East  Sector  in  the  office  designated  allo, 
which  means  “All  other  countries.”  This  sector  concerns  itself  with  the  U.A.R., 
Syria,  Iraq,  Lebanon,  Jordan,  Saudi  Arabia,  Yemen,  Libya,  Morocco,  Tunisia, 
Turkey,  Iran,  Greece,  and  Ethiopia.  The  duties  of  my  colleagues  in  allo  included 
the  study  and  breaking  of  military  ciphers  of  these  countries,  and  also  the 
deciphering  of  all  correspondence  reaching  their  diplomatic  representatives  in 
any  part  of  the  world.  . . . N.S.A.  reads  the  ciphers  of  all  these  countries  by 
applying  cryptanalysis.  . . . 

I knew  for  a fact  that  the  State  Department  and  Defense  Department  sys- 
tematically read,  analyzed,  and  utilized  in  their  own  interests  the  enciphered 
correspondence  between  the  U.A.R.  embassies  in  Europe  and  the  U.A.R. 
government  in  Cairo. 

For  example,  I had  in  my  desk  all  the  deciphered  communications  between 
Cairo  and  the  U.A.R.  Embassy  in  Moscow  relating  to  the  visit  of  the  U.A.R. 
government  mission  to  the  U.S.S.R.  in  1958  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing  petro- 
leum in  the  Soviet  Union.  N.S.A.  sent  all  these  communications  to  the  State 
Department  just  as  it  continually  sends  it  the  deciphered  instructions  of  the 
U.A.R.  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  to  its  embassy  in  Washington.  . . .

It  is  especially  important  to  note  that  American  authorities  take  advantage 
of  the  fact  that  the  U.N.  headquarters  is  located  on  American  soil.  Their  high- 
handedness has  reached  the  point  where  the  enciphered  instructions  of  the 
governments  of  the  U.A.R.,  Iraq,  Jordan,  Lebanon,  Turkey,  and  Greece  to  their 
missions  to  the  U.N.  General  Assembly  fall  into  the  hands  of  the  State  Depart- 
ment before  arriving  at  their  proper  address. 

The  intelligence  that  flows  out  of  Fort  Meade  mingles  with  intelligence 
from  many  other  sources  to  help  high  officials  determine  national  policy  and 
tactics  within  the  framework  of  American  goals.  N.S.A.  intelligence  is  not  as 
voluminous  as  C.I.A.’s,  a former  top  C.I.A.  official  has  said,  but  it  is  of  a 
higher  grade.  All  intelligence  is  evaluated  for  credibility,  and  cryptanalyzed 
intelligence  must  nearly  always  get  the  highest  rating  (some  messages  may  be 
dummies)  because  it  comes  straight  from  the  mouths  of  the  subjects  them- 
selves. N.S.A.’s  intelligence  covers  the  gamut  of  communications  of  modern 
nations,  from  the  minutiae  of  legation  routine  to  the  secret  instructions  to  am- 
bassadors. Even  at  its  most  complete,  however,  it  can  illuminate  but  part  of 
the  intelligence  picture.  The  solutions  allude  to  persons  and  facts  and  basic 
policies  half  known  or  unknown  to  the  interceptor;  they  presuppose  a com- 
mon knowledge  not  at  his  disposal;  they  do  not  include  information  exchanged 
by  personal  contact,  letter,  telephone.  Most  messages  mean  little  standing 
alone;  only  context  makes  them  comprehensible.  Cryptanalysis  thus  com- 
plements other  forms  of  intelligence,  overt  and  covert,  just  as  they  comple- 
ment it. 

Perhaps  it  is  the  incompleteness  of  cryptanalytic  intelligence  that  led  to 
American  officials’  apparently  disbelieving  it  at  the  time  of  the  Suez  crisis, 
despite  its  seemingly  unimpeachable  authenticity.  Just  after  that  crisis  had 
passed  its  peak,  George  Wigg,  a Labor  Member  of  Parliament,  told  news- 
papermen that  the  United  States  had  broken  British,  French,  and  Israeli  codes 
and  so  had  prior  knowledge  of  plans  for  their  invasion  of  Egypt  at  the  end  of 
October  and  beginning  of  November,  1956.  Though  he  attributed  the  solution 
to  the  “United  States  Air  Research  and  Development  Command,  Griffis 
Air  Force  Base,  Rome,  New  York,”  Wigg’s  basic  point  seems  to  have  been 
independently  confirmed  by  C.I.A.  chief  Allen  Dulles,  who  wrote  several 
years  later  of  the  Suez  invasion:  “Here  intelligence  was  well  alerted  as  to  both 
the  possibility  and  later  the  probability  of  the  actions  taken  by  Israel  and  then 
by  Britain  and  France.”  Why,  then,  did  the  United  States  take  no  action? 
Dulles  does  not  say,  but  Wigg  thought  “that  the  United  States  State  Depart- 
ment knew  from  the  middle  of  October  what  the  French  and  the  Israelis  were 
planning  to  do.  What  I think  they  may  have  doubted  was  that  the  British 
Government  would  ever  be  so  foolish  as  to  get  caught  up  in  an  adventure 
which  was  bound  to  end  in  disaster.”  Secretary  of  State  John  Foster  Dulles 
said  at  the  time:  “We  had  no  advance  information  of  any  kind.  The  later 
contradiction  by  his  brother  Allen  suggests  that  this  may  be  a cover-up  for 
failure  to  act.  Wigg,  moreover,  is  not  an  M.P.  whose  inside  information  can

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


be  taken  lightly:  in  1963  he  exposed  the  John  Profumo-Christine  Keeler 
scandal  that  very  nearly  toppled  England’s  Conservative  government.  Suez 
has  been  called  one  of  America’s  worst  intelligence  disasters.  It  seems  more 
likely  that  the  fault  lay,  not  with  the  producers  of  intelligence,  but  with  the 
consumers.  No  human  being  has  ever  had  difficulty  in  finding  an  excuse  to 
overlook  an  unpleasant  fact.  The  consumers  did  not  want  to  believe  the  con- 
trary evidence  of  the  cryptanalyzed  intelligence  (assuming  that  it  existed).  So 
they  simply  did  not  believe  it — and  perhaps  justified  their  disbelief  on  the 
basis  of  its  incompleteness.  Against  this  human  predilection  no  form  of 
intelligence  can  prevail. 

Yet  where  personal  factors  are  less  strongly  engaged,  cryptanalysis  must 
assert  itself  as  one  of  the  most  useful  of  intelligence  sources.  Its  intermingling 
with  other  sources  makes  it  difficult  to  gauge  its  own  particular  value  to  the 
American  government.  The  message  that  by  itself  leads  to  results  as  spectacu- 
lar as  those  of  a Zimmermann  telegram  or  a Yamamoto  flight  schedule  must 
be  exceedingly  rare.  The  impact  of  cryptanalysis  must  come  in  the  way 
that  the  falling  of  many  snowflakes,  each  one  imperceptible  to  the  ear,  adds 
up  to  make  an  audible  hiss  in  a wood. 

Occasionally,  however,  instances  occur  in  which  the  importance  of  crypt- 
analysis has  been  made  manifest.  One  such  case  was  Hamilton’s  referring 
to  “the  letter  in  which  Henry  Cabot  Lodge,  then  the  American  ambassador 
to  the  United  Nations,  expressed  his  appreciation  to  members  of  allo  for 
information  about  the  instructions  sent  by  the  Near  East  governments  to  their 
U.N.  missions.”  Another — which  showed  the  unsung  workers  at  N.S.A.  that 
the  highest  official  in  the  land  appreciates  their  work — came  on  March  2,  1966, 
when  career  cryptanalyst  Frank  B.  Rowlett  received  the  National  Security 
Medal  in  a White  House  ceremony  from  the  hands  of  the  President  of  the 
United  States  himself. 

What  about  other  countries?  Many  of  them  do  have  cryptanalytic  bur- 
eaus, particularly  the  older  ones.  Britain  of  course  does;  her  General  Com- 
munication Headquarters  lies  within  her  Foreign  Office.  Germany’s  is  likewise 
within  her  Foreign  Office.  France’s  appears  to  be  within  her  Ministere  des 
Armees.  It  seems  likely  that  about  two  thirds  of  the  Latin  American  countries 
have  codebreaking  agencies,  but  few  of  the  new  nations  of  Africa  do.  Some 
Arab  nations  must  have  them,  perhaps  started  by  German  cryptanalysts 
who  went  to  the  Near  East  after  the  war  (but  have  reportedly  since  returned 
home).  In  Scandinavia,  Sweden’s  agency  remains  active.  In  the  Far  East,  the 
cryptanalytic  unit  within  Japan’s  Naikaku  Chosashitsu  (“Cabinet  Investiga- 
tion Board”),  a general  intelligence  agency,  solved  the  codes  of  South  Korea 
and  exploited  the  information  in  political  negotiations  early  in  the  1960s  so 
effectively  that  when  South  Korea  found  out,  it  stopped  cabling  messages  to 
its  negotiators  and  sent  instructions  by  diplomatic  pouch  instead. 

But  none  of  these  can  compare  with  N.S.A. — any  more  than  the  countries 


N.S.A.

themselves  can  compare  with  the  United  States  in  any  other  field.  It  comes 
down,  as  always,  to  a question  of  economics.  Though  these  smaller  countries 
are  usually  chiefly  interested  in  the  cryptograms  of  their  neighbors,  they  can- 
not maintain  the  worldwide  intercept  facilities  that  would  give  them  different 
encipherments  of  circular  messages  that  are  often  essential  for  modern 
cryptanalysis.  They  cannot  get  enough  messages  to  make  it  likely  that  one  of 
them  will  contain  an  encipherer’s  error.  They  cannot  support  the  large  crypt- 
analytic organizations  that  alone  can  build  the  experience  and  resources  to 
solve  today’s  machine  ciphers.  In  many  of  these  countries,  the  cryptanalysts 
are  more  gifted  amateurs  than  professionals.  Their  governments  are  hard- 
pressed  to  build  schools  and  irrigation  systems.  They  do  not  have  the  money 
to  buy  electronic  computers  for  their  codebreakers.  In  cryptology,  as  elsewhere, 
success  breeds  success. 

Where,  then,  is  the  science  headed?  Are  there  any  trends  that  can  be 
foreseen?  For  there  are  fashions  in  cryptology  as  in  other  things.  The  one- 
time pad,  very  popular  after  World  War  II,  has  fallen  out  of  favor.  More 
popular  now  seem  to  be  rotor  machines — with  from  three  to  eight  rotors 
and  Hagelin  machines.  For  airplane  and  front-line  messages,  small  codes 
seem  to  be  common. 

Future  developments  may  be  foreshadowed  by  a U.S.  Air  Force  state- 
ment that 

One  of  the  primary  Air  Force  communications  security  objectives  is  total 
security  of  aircomnet  [the  basic  wire  and  radio  teletype  network]  at  the  earliest 
date.  It  is  intended  to  accomplish  this  by  means  of  link  encryption.  This  is  a 
system  which  is  integral  to  the  communications  system  and  which  automatically 
secures  all  links  of  the  communications  system  by  on-line  synchronous  devices. 
When  total  security  of  aircomnet  is  achieved,  two  distinct  advantages  will  occur : 

(1)  Unclassified  common-user  traffic  introduced  into  aircomnet  will  not  be 
vulnerable  to  unfriendly  intercept  and  analysis.  U.S.A.F.  Security  Service  has 
repeatedly  revealed,  through  analysis  of  clear  text  unclassified  traffic  now  being 
handled  over  aircomnet,  vital  information  regarding  the  Air  Force  order  of 
battle,  disposition  and  employment  of  combat  air  power,  functions  of  key 
personnel,  and  similar  data. 

(2)  It  will  be  possible  to  introduce  classified  messages  up  to  and  including 
secret  into  aircomnet,  without  first  resorting  to  off-line  processing. 

This  is  part  of  a more  basic  Air  Force  aim  of  a communications  complex 
that  will  “provide  full  protection  for  information  flowing  within  Air  Force 
communications  channels,  including  the  exclusion  of  unauthorized  entry  into 
the  systems.  This  goal  will  be  approached,  first,  by  providing  comsec  pro- 
tection to  each  of  the  individual  communications  networks  and  later  by  pro- 
viding total  end-to-end  encryption  throughout  the  complex.” 

The  Air  Force  drive  toward  total  end-to-end  encipherment  carries  with  it 
a tendency  toward  a single  all-purpose  cipher,  for  such  encipherment  can 


732 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


most  easily  and  most  safely  be  applied  by  such  a cipher.  A single  all-purpose 
cipher,  simple  enough  for  the  lowest  echelon,  secure  enough  for  the  highest, 
variable  enough  to  nullify  the  danger  of  capture  or  compromise,  would 
eliminate  or  reduce  many  of  the  problems  produced  by  the  present  multiplicity 
of  systems — the  need  sometimes  to  reencipher  a message  in  a system  the 
ultimate  recipient  holds,  the  difficulties  of  storing,  distributing,  and  account- 
ing for  half  a dozen  different  sets  of  ciphers  instead  of  for  just  one. 

One  possible  form  of  this  ideal  cipher — perhaps  the  most  likely — is  that  of 
a system  using  a long,  quasi-random  key  generated  by  mathematical  methods 
and  “added”  to  the  plaintext,  either  numerically  as  with  the  one-time  pad  or 
electrically  as  with  the  Vernam  method.  A special-purpose  computer  might 
produce  such  a key  from  a few  key  digits,  some  of  them  common  to  the  whole 
communications  net  and  changing  at  fixed  intervals,  some  chosen  at  random 
by  the  encipherer  for  each  message  and  inserted  at  a prearranged  place  in  the 
cryptogram. 

Many  generating  methods  are  possible.  The  simplest  is  chain  addition. 
Successive  digits  of  the  priming  key  are  added  together  and  the  sum  tacked 
onto  the  end  of  the  keynumber,  forming  part  of  it,  and  the  process  repeated 
with  these  digits.  For  example,  with  the  priming  key  3 9 6 4,  3 and  9 are  12, 
which  is  listed  as  2,  since  all  addition  is  noncarrying  and  tens  digits  are 
dropped;  9 and  6 are  5,  and  6 and  4 are  0.  These  three  figures  join  the  key 
at  its  tail : 3 9 6 4 2 5 0.  The  process  is  then  continued  with  4 and  2,  making  6, 
which  is  put  on  after  the  0,  with  2 and  5,  making  a 7 which  is  put  on  after  the  6, 
and  soon:39642506756321....  More  complex  methods  are  possible. 
The  computer  might  multiply  a base  keynumber  for  the  day  by  a message 
keynumber  to  ten  places,  then  multiply  the  product  by  the  basic  key  to  ten 
places,  that  product  again  by  the  basic  key  to  ten  places,  and  so  on,  each  time 
extracting  the  last  four  digits  of  each  product  as  the  final  key. 

These  systems  are  not  unbreakable.  Recovery  of  any  portion  of  a chain- 
added  key  will  yield  the  entire  key,  assuming  the  length  of  the  priming  key  is 
known,  or  one  of  several  possible  keys,  assuming  that  the  priming-key  length 
is  not  known.  In  more  complicated  systems,  a probable  word  could  yield  a 
fragment  of  possible  key  which  mathematical  analysis  could  extend  forward 
and  backward  for  tests  and  possible  solution. 

Nevertheless,  if  the  key  generation  system  could  be  made  both  sufficiently 
flexible  and  sufficiently  complex,  such  a cipher  might  attain  sufficient  security. 
A computer  the  size  of  a transistor  radio  could  produce  a stream  of  digital 
pulses  or  numbers.  Plugged  into  an  ordinary  teletype  or  a front-line  pulse- 
code  modulation  scrambler,  it  could  provide  an  on-line  encipherment  of 
sufficient  security.  This  might  be  the  cipher  of  the  future,  and  thus  cryptology 
would  return  in  a more  sophisticated  way  to  a universal  system,  from  which 
it  has  been  divorced  since  the  telegraph  destroyed  the  nomenclator. 

But  what  about  the  field  as  a whole?  The  growth  of  political  cryptology 
has  been  exponential  since  it  began  4,000  years  ago.  Will  new  methods  like 


N.S.A. 


733 


lasers,  which  provide  hard-to-intercept  line-of-sight  communications,  reverse 
that  trend  for  the  first  time? 

Probably  not.  Radio’s  advantage  in  establishing  out-of-sight  communica- 
tion is  so  great  that  its  use  will  probably  continue  to  increase,  just  as  com- 
munication and  literacy  itself  always  have.  In  any  case,  the  advent  of  such 
techniques  as  the  laser  would  merely  shift  the  element  of  secrecy  from  crypto- 
graphy to  transmission  security.  It  would  not  diminish  the  amount  of  secrecy 
in  communication.  Though  in  the  past  the  amount  of  secrecy — the  amount  of 
cryptology,  in  other  words — has  always  grown  as  rapidly  as  communication 
itself  has,  the  secrecy  comes  not  from  the  communication  but  from  politics, 
from  statecraft,  from  the  governments  who  apply  and  seek  to  remove  that 
secrecy.  The  future  of  cryptology  contains  many  questions  of  technology, 
but  the  waxing  or  waning  of  the  field  as  a whole  is  not  among  them.  That 
question  is  human.

THE  ANATOMY  OF  CRYPTOLOGY 


cryptography  and  cryptanalysis  are  sometimes  called  twin  or 
reciprocal  sciences,  and  in  function  they  indeed  mirror  one  another.  What 
one  does  the  other  undoes.  Their  natures,  however,  differ  fundamentally. 
Cryptography  is  theoretical  and  abstract.  Cryptanalysis  is  empirical  and 
concrete. 

The  methods  of  cryptography  are  mathematical.  “It  would  not  be  an 
exaggeration  to  state  that  abstract  cryptography  is  identical  with  abstract 
mathematics,”  declared  Dr.  A.  Adrian  Albert.  Maurits  de  Vries,  a Dutch 
statistician  and  theoretician  of  cryptology,  wrote  of  cryptography:  The 
transformations  are  generally  of  a simple  mathematical  nature.  E.g.  permuta- 
tions in  the  set  of  primary  elements  (the  alphabet);  coordinate  transforma- 
tions of  lattice  points;  addition  and  subtraction  in  finite  rings;  linear  algebraic 
transformations.  ...  A simple  example  of  such  a secrecy-transformation  is . 
v = ax  +b,  where  x represents  a letter  of  the  message;  y is  the  resulting  letter 
of  the  cryptogram;  a and  b denote  constants  which  determine  this  particular 
transformation.  Calculations  with  the  letters  are  easily  carried  out  after 
defining  a suitable  algebra.” 

Thus  the  operations  and  results  of  cryptography  are  as  universally  and 
eternally  true  as  those  of  mathematics.  Within  the  “suitable  algebra”  of  the 
ordinary  26-letter  Vigenere,  it  would  be  as  logically  impossible  to  deny  that 
plaintext  b keyed  with  C yields  d as  to  deny  that  1+2  = 3.  And  this  holds  on 
Mars  in  the  25th  century  as  equally  as  in  France  in  the  16th.  Different  ciphers, 
like  different  geometries,  yield  results  that  are  different  but  equally  valid. 

The  situation  is  not  at  all  the  same  with  cryptanalysis.  Its  methods  are 
those  of  the  physical  sciences.  They  rest,  not  upon  the  unchanging  verities  of 
mathematical  logic,  but  upon  observable  facts  of  the  real  world.  The  crypt- 
analyst must  obtain  these  data  by  experiment,  by  measurement.  Unlike  the 
cryptographer,  who  can  deduce  any  enciphering  equation  in  Vigenere  from  a 
few  initial  conditions  without  recourse  to  any  further  experience,  the  crypt- 
analyst cannot  tell  from  any  number  of  statements  about  English  which  is  its 
most  frequent  letter.  He  has  to  count  the  letters.  The  facts  may  be  constants, 
but  they  are  not  logical  necessities.  They  depend  upon  circumstance,  upon 
reality. 


737

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Philosophy  offers  a useful  distinction  between  statements  like  those  of 
cryptography  and  statements  like  those  of  cryptanalysis.  The  statements  of 
cryptography,  whose  denial  would  be  self-contradictory,  are  analytic.  The 
statements  of  cryptanalysis,  whose  denial  would  not  be  self-contradictory,  are 
synthetic.  It  might  even  be  said  that  cryptography  deals  with  noumena, 
cryptanalysis  with  phenomena. 

The  empirical  nature  of  cryptanalysis  appears  in  its  operations.  These  con- 
sist of  the  four  steps  of  what  is  commonly  called  the  “scientific  method,” 
which  scientists  apply  in  attacking  problems  in  the  natural  sciences.  They  are: 
analysis  (such  as  counting  the  letters),  hypothesis  (x  might  be  e),  prediction 
(if  x is  e,  then  some  plaintext  possibilities  should  emerge),  and  verification 
(they  do)  or  refutation  (they  don’t,  so  x is  probably  not  e),  either  case  starting 
a new  chain  of  reasoning.  (This  common  ground  of  scientific  method  between 
cryptanalysis  and  other  sciences  validates  such  metaphorical  statements  as 
“He  sought  to  decipher  the  history  of  the  earth  from  layers  of  rock.”) 

Within  this  general  format,  cryptanalysis  operates  in  two  ways,  deductive 
and  inductive.  Deductive  solutions  are  those  based  on  frequency  analysis; 
they  are  the  general  solution  for  any  cipher  system.  Inductive  solutions  are 
those  based  on  probable  words  or  on  lucky  occurrences,  such  as  two  crypto- 
grams with  the  same  plaintext;  they  are  special  solutions. 

Solutions  based  on  frequency  analysis  move  from  a knowledge  of  letter 
frequency  to  an  application  of  it  to  the  cryptogram  at  hand.  Reasoning  that 
flows  from  the  general  to  the  specific  like  this  is  deduction.  A typical  syllogism 
in  the  frequency  analysis  of  an  English  mon  alphabetic  substitution  would 
have  as  its  major  premise,  “The  most  frequent  letter  in  the  cryptogram  is 
probably  the  substitute  for  e,”  as  its  minor  premise,  “x  is  the  most  frequent 
letter  in  the  cryptogram,”  and  as  its  conclusion,  “x  is  probably  the  substitute 
for  e.”  Since  all  languages  have  well-defined  characteristics  of  letter  frequency, 
this  deductive  pattern  is  known  to  apply  to  any  cryptogram  even  before  it  is 
inspected.  Such  a solution  is  thus  a priori  in  its  nature.  And  because  this  kind 
of  solution  will  always  work,  given  enough  text,  it  is  the  general  solution. 

Inductive  solutions,  on  the  other  hand,  will  work  only  when  certain  condi- 
tions are  fulfilled.  Because  the  cryptanalyst  cannot  tell  whether  those  condi- 
tions are  indeed  fulfilled  until  after  he  has  obtained  the  cryptogram  and 
knowledge  of  its  circumstances,  inductive  solutions  are  a posteriori  in  nature. 

If  an  enemy  post  radios  a message  just  after  it  has  been  subjected  to  heavy 
fire  followed  by  a tank  assault,  the  cryptanalyst  might  well  conclude  that  the 
cryptogram  contains  bombardment  and  attack  in  its  plaintext.  These  are  prob- 
able words,  which  he  can  use  to  jimmy  open  the  cryptogram.  (Common 
words  such  as  the,  that,  and,  and  so  on,  which  are  probable  in  all  texts  because 
of  their  high  frequency,  do  not  constitute  probable  words  in  this  sense.)  The 
cryptanalyst’s  reasoning  issues  from  the  numerous  specific  facts  surrounding 
the  message  and  crystallizes  into  a single  conclusion  concerning  its  plaintext. 
Such  reasoning  is  inductive.  So  is  the  reasoning  used  in  lucky-break,  or 


739 


The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology 

special-case,  solutions.  Only  after  Painvin  had  noticed  the  identical  bits  and 
pieces  of  text  in  two  adfgx  cryptograms  could  he  assume  that  they  both  had 
identical  plaintext  beginnings  and  thus  commence  his  cryptanalysis  (which 
in  this  case  might  better  be  called  a “cryptosynthesis”). 

Because  probable  words  and  special  cases  enable  the  cryptanalyst  to  bring 
extra  information  to  bear,  such  solutions  display  great  power  and  fruitfulness 
and  are  often  the  first  to  be  achieved  in  new  systems.  But  they  are  limited  to 
particular  situations,  and  so  cryptanalysts  seek  the  deductive  general  solution 
of  frequency  analysis  that  will  always  apply. 

The  realization  that  cryptography  was  essentially  mathematical,  glimpsed 
by  Babbage  and  de  Viaris  and  Hill  and  others,  and  made  explicit  by  Albert, 
afforded  great  insight  into  cryptography.  It  also  paved  ways  to  new  solutions. 
In  cryptanalysis,  the  principles  of  letter  frequency  gradually  expanded  to  help 
solve  ciphers  that  at  first  seemed  outside  their  ambient  (such  as  columnar 
transposition).  When  Friedman  brought  those  principles  within  the  broader 
field  of  statistics,  cryptanalysts  could  train  really  powerful  new  guns  upon 
ciphers.  But  even  this  great  expansion  of  knowledge  did  not  reach  to  the 
frontiers  of  cryptanalysis  and  there  confront  the  phenomenon  upon  which 
cryptanalysis  rests — the  constancy  ofletter  frequency.  Shortly  after  World  War 
II,  however,  a remarkable  new  theory  emerged  that  has  provided  an  explanation 
of  that  phenomenon  and  ol  the  whole  process  of  cryptanalysis  itself.  It  has 
not  had  the  practical  effects  that  Friedman’s  work  has  had,  but  it  affords,  for 
the  first  time,  a thorough  understanding  of  why  cryptanalysis  is  possible. 

The  astonishing  stability  and  universality  of  the  phenomenon  of  letter 
frequency  is  not  often  realized.  Other  activities  besides  cryptanalysis  depend 
upon  the  fixity  ofletter  frequency,  and  flouting  it  can  cause  economic  losses. 
A demonstration  of  these  matters  leads  through  some  amusing  and  little- 
known  byways. 

In  1939,  the  Wetzel  Publishing  Company  of  Los  Angeles  issued  a 267-page 
novel  of  but  moderate  literary  merit  but  so  distinctive  that  in  its  way  it  stands 
unrivalled  by  any  other  work  in  the  entire  history  of  the  English  language. 
Here  is  how  the  author  summarizes  his  tale  in  his  opening  pages.  The  excerpt 
fairly  illustrates  the  book’s  unique  feature: 

Upon  this  basis  I am  going  to  show  you  how  a bunch  of  bright  young  folks 
did  find  a champion ; a man  with  boys  and  girls  of  his  own ; a man  of  so  dominat- 
ing and  happy  individuality  that  Youth  is  drawn  to  him  as  is  a fly  to  a sugar 
bowl.  It  is  a story  about  a small  town.  It  is  not  a gossipy  yarn;  nor  is  it  a dry, 
monotonous  account,  full  of  such  customary  “fill-ins”  as  "romantic  moonlight 
casting  murky  shadows  down  a long,  winding  country  road.’  Nor  will  it  say 
anything  about  twinklings  lulling  distant  folds;  robins  carolling  at  twilight,  nor 
any  “warm  glow  of  lamplight”  from  a cabin  window.  No.  It  is  an  account  of 
up-and-doing  activity;  a vivid  portrayal  of  Youth  as  it  is  today;  and  a practical 
discarding  of  that  worn-out  notion  that  “a  child  don’t  know  anything.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  title  divulges  the  novel’s  distinction:  Gadsby,  A Story  of  Over  50,000 
Words  Without  Using  the  Letter  E.  It  is  an  amazing  tour  de  force.  Let  the 
skeptical  reader  see  how  long  it  takes  to  compose  even  a sentence  without  an 
e.  The  author  of  Gadsby,  a persevering,  dauntless,  white-haired  old  gentleman 
named  Ernest  Vincent  Wright,  enumerated  some  of  the  problems  of  his  self- 
imposed  task.  He  had  to  avoid  most  verbs  in  the  past  tense  because  they  end 
in  -ed.  He  could  never  use  the  or  the  pronouns  he,  she,  they,  we,  me,  and  them. 
Gadsby  had  to  omit  such  seemingly  indispensable  verbs  as  are,  have,  were,  be 
and  been  and  such  basic  words  as  there,  these,  those,  when,  then,  more,  after 
and  very.  A purist,  Wright  refused  to  use  numbers  between  6 and  30,  even  as 
digits,  because  an  e was  implied  when  they  were  spelled  out.  (“When  intro- 
ducing young  ladies  into  the  story,  this  is  a real  barrier,”  Wright  complained, 
“for  what  young  woman  wants  to  have  it  known  that  she  is  over  thirty.”) 
Similarly,  he  banned  Mr.  and  Mrs.  because  of  the  e in  their  unabbreviated 
form.  One  of  the  most  annoying  problems  would  arise,  when,  near  the  end  of 
a long  paragraph,  he  could  find  no  e-less  word  with  which  to  complete  the 
thought,  and  had  to  go  back  and  rewrite  the  entire  paragraph.  So  frequently 
did  Wright  find  himself  wanting  to  use  a word  containing  an  e that  he  had  to  tie 
down  the  e typebar  of  his  typewriter  to  make  it  impossible  for  one  to  slip  in. 

“And  many  did  try  to  do  so,”  he  says  in  his  preface.  “As  I wrote  along,  in 
long-hand  at  first,  a whole  army  of  little  e’s  gathered  around  my  desk,  all 
eagerly  expecting  to  be  called  upon.  But  gradually  as  they  saw  me  writing  on 
and  on,  without  even  noticing  them,  they  grew  uneasy;  and,  with  excited 
whisperings  amongst  themselves,  began  hopping  up  and  riding  on  my  pen, 
looking  down  constantly  for  a chance  to  drop  off  into  some  word;  for  all  the 
world  like  seabirds  perched,  watching  for  a passing  fish!  But  when  they  saw 
that  I had  covered  138  pages  of  typewriter  size  paper,  they  slid  off  onto  the 
floor,  walking  sadly  away,  arm  in  arm;  but  shouting  back:  ‘You  certainly 
must  have  a hodge-podge  of  a yarn  there  without  Us\  Why,  man!  We  are  in 
every  story  ever  written,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  times ! This  is  the  first  time 
we  ever  were  shut  out !’  ” The  story  required,  Wright  declared,  “five  and  a half 
months  of  concentrated  endeavor,  with  so  many  erasures  and  retrenchments 
that  I tremble  as  I think  of  them.” 

Wright’s  trembling  dramatizes  the  tenacity  and  pervasiveness  of  the  mere 
presence  of  a single  letter  in  English.  Others  are  equally  tenacious,  and  other 
writers  have,  as  literary  curiosities,  produced  lipograms — writings  in  which 
one  or  more  letters  are  deliberately  omitted.  A classical  Greek  author  named 
Tryphiodorus  reportedly  composed  an  Odyssey  whose  first  book  excluded 
alpha,  the  second,  beta,  and  so  on  through  all  24  books.  But  despite  the 
inflexibility  of  letter  frequency  and  the  wide  variation  among  the  frequencies 
of  individual  letters  in  all  languages,  it  is  so  inconspicuous  that  many  people 
never  even  suspect  its  presence. 

One  such  was  Christopher  Latham  Sholes,  the  inventor  of  the  typewriter 
and,  apparently,  the  perpetrator  of  its  atrocious  keyboard.  The  keyboard 


741 


The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology 

arrangement  first  appeared  in  a preproduction  model  produced  in  1872. 
Vestiges  of  an  alphabetical  order  appear  in  the  dfghjkl  of  the  second  row, 
and  it  is  rumored  but  not  substantiated  that  the  top  row  included  the  letters 
of  the  word  “typewriter”  so  that  salesmen  could  find  them  easily  in  demonstra- 
tions. The  inefficiency  of  the  qwertyuiop  keyboard  costs  businessmen  time 
and  money.  In  a right-handed  world,  it  gives  the  left  hand  56  per  cent  of  all 
strokes.  Of  all  motions  for  successive  letters,  48  per  cent  use  only  one  hand 
instead  of  two.  Thus  words  like  federated  and  addressed  force  the  left  hand  to 
leap  frantically  among  the  keys  while  the  right  languishes  in  unemployed 
torpor.  Much  more  efficient  is  the  even  rhythm  of  the  two-handed  thicken. 
As  if  to  emphasize  the  problem,  touch-typing  places  the  two  most  agile  fingers 
of  the  right  hand  directly  on  keys  for  two  of  the  least  frequent  letters  of  the 
alphabet,  j and  k. 

These  glaring  faults  have  spurred  design  of  numerous  keyboards.  The 
Minimotion  keyboard,  developed  after  an  exhaustive  statistical  analysis  by 
engineer  Roy  T.  Griffith,  raises  the  percentage  of  right-handed  strokes  to  52, 
of  two-handed  motions  to  67  and  of  strokes  in  the  touch-typist’s  home  row  to 
71  over  the  qwertyuiop  keyboard’s  32.  Tests  in  a Chicago  elementary  school 
showed  that  pupils  learned  to  type  twice  as  fast  on  another  simplified  key- 
board, the  Dvorak-Dealey,  than  on  the  standard.  Experiments  by  a New 
York  management  consultant  firm  conclusively  demonstrated  the  superiority 
of  a keyboard  that  fits  instead  of  fights  principles  of  frequency.  But  all  reform 
has  been  blocked  by  the  inertia  of  typists  who  do  not  want  to  learn  a new 
touch  system  all  over  again  and  by  business  firms  who  do  not  want  to  pay  for 
the  conversion  of  standard-keyboard  typewriters. 

Where  men  take  advantage  of  the  facts  of  letter  frequency,  they  may  reap 
extra  profits.  Samuel  F.  B.  Morse  is  probably  the  best  example.  When  he 
decided  about  1838  to  use  an  alphabetical  system  of  signals  for  his  newly 
invented  electromagnetic  telegraph,  he  counted  the  letters  in  a Philadelphia 
newspaper’s  typecase  so  he  could  assign  the  shorter  dot-and-dash  symbols  to 
the  more  common  letters.  He  found  12,000  e’s,  9,000  t s,  8,000  each  of  a,  o, 
n,  i,  and  5,  6,400,  K s,  and  so  on.  With  few  exceptions,  he  followed  this  list  in 
his  original  code,  assigning  the  shortest  symbol,  a dot,  to  the  most  common 
letter,  e,  another  short  symbol,  a dash,  to  t,  and  so  forth.  With  the  modern 
International  Morse  Code,  slightly  different  from  his  original  American 
Morse,  transmission  of  an  English  message  of  100  letters  requires  about  940 
dot-units.  (The  duration  of  a dot  equals  one  dot-unit,  a dash  equals  three  dot- 
units,  space  between  dots  and  dashes  of  a letter  equals  one  dot-unit,  space 
between  letters  equals  three  dot-units.)  If  the  symbols  had  been  assigned  at 
random,  the  same  message  would  run  about  1,160  dot-units — or  about  23 
per  cent  longer.  Morse’s  perspicacity  may  have  rewarded  his  successors 
financially  by  making  it  possible  to  handle  almost  one  quarter  more  messages 
on  a telegraph  line  within  a rush  period  than  if  he  had  made  up  his  code 
haphazardly.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Long  before  Morse,  typefounders  realized  that  it  was  to  their  advantage 
not  to  case  as  many  q's  or  z’s  as  e’s  in  a font,  though  they  had  to  add  extras 
in  the  rare  letters  to  allow  for  occasional  odd  combinations,  such  as  Hamlet’s 
“Buzz,  Buzz!”  The  practice  is  still  current:  the  font  of  12-point  Bodoni  Book 
(a  standard  body  type)  sold  by  American  Type  Founders  contains  53  lower- 
case e’s  and  only  6 z’s.  Similarly,  Ottmar  Mergenthaler  decided  that  the  letter 
matrices  in  his  Linotype  should  be  arranged  in  order  of  the  demand  for  each

The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology  743 

This  accounts  for  the  etaoin  shrdlu  sometimes  seen  in  newspapers:  linotypists 
just  run  their  fingers  down  the  keys  to  fill  out  an  incorrect  line. 

Even  more  scientifically  designed  is  the  panel  of  the  Mergenthaler  com- 
pany’s Linofilm  system.  This  system  passes  light  through  pictures  of  letters 
onto  a film,  where  the  successive  images  form  text  usable  in  offset  photo- 
lithography. The  pictures  are  mounted  on  the  panel  in  an  arrangement  that 
exploits  not  only  monographic  but  digraphic  frequencies  to  minimize  the 
shifting  of  the  panel  during  composition.  For  example,  t and  h lie  next  to 
one  another. 

These  examples  imply  that  the  frequencies  of  letters  do  remain  fairly 
constant.  Actual  frequency  counts  back  this  up.  A number  of  cryptologists 
have  counted  the  numbers  of  e’s  in  German  texts  of  about  1,000  letters,  and 
their  percentages  vary  only  slightly:  Kasiski,  18.4;  Valerio,  18.3;  Carmona, 
18.5;  Hitt,  16;  Givierge,  18;  Lange  and  Soudart,  18.8;  Baudouin,  19.2;  Pratt, 
16.7.  These  may  be  compared  with  a frequency  count  that  is  as  close  to 
completeness  as  anyone  is  likely  to  get — a tabulation  of  no  fewer  than 
59,298,274  letters,  derived  from  a count  of  20,000,000  German  syllables 
made  for  linguistic  purposes  in  1898  by  the  philologist  F.  W.  Kaeding,  who 
was  nothing  if  not  indefatigable.  Kaeding  found  10,598,015  e’s,  or  17.9  per 
cent.  What  is  perhaps  most  striking  is  that  the  eight  shorter  counts  average  to 
18.0  per  cent— a difference  of  only  one  e per  thousand  letters  from  the  Kaed- 
ing standard.  Thus  does  language  cleave  to  its  statistical  norms! 

Why  ? The  answer  may  be  found  within  the  theory  formulated  after  World 
War  II  that  not  only  explains  cryptanalysis  but  also  extends  far  beyond.  It  is 
called  “information  theory”  or,  sometimes,  a “mathematical  theory  of  com- 
munication.” It  deals  in  general  with  the  mathematical  laws  that  govern 
systems  designed  to  communicate  information.  Originating  in  transmission 
problems  of  telephony  and  telegraphy,  it  has  grown  to  embrace  virtually  all 
information-processing  devices,  from  standard  communications  systems  to 
electronic  computers  and  servomechanisms,  and  even  the  nerve  networks  of 
animals  and  men.  Its  ideas  have  proved  so  suggestive  that  they  have  been 
adapted  to  such  fields  as  psychology,  linguistics,  molecular  genetics,  history, 
statistics,  and  neurophysiology.  Because  of  this  fertility,  and  because  of  its 
potential  in  helping  to  manage  the  information  explosion  of  the  20th  century, 
information  theory  may  eventually  rank.  Fortune  magazine  has  speculated, 
among  the  “enduring  great”  theories  of  man.  The  brilliant  mind  that  fathered 
it  also  sired  its  cryptologic  applications. 

Claude  Elwood  Shannon  was  born  in  Petoskey,  Michigan,  on  April  30, 
1916,  and  was  raised  in  nearby  Gaylord,  a small  town  in  the  north-central 
portion  of  Michigan’s  southern  peninsula.  He  majored  in  electrical  engineer- 
ing and  mathematics  at  the  University  of  Michigan  and  there  developed  an 
interest  in  communications  and  cryptology.  At  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of 
Technology,  where  in  1940  he  was  awarded  a Ph.D.  in  mathematics,  he  wrote  a 
master’s  thesis  of  such  originality  that  it  had  an  immediate  impact  on  the

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


designing  of  telephone  systems.  After  a year  at  the  Institute  for  Advanced 
Study  in  Princeton,  he  joined  the  staff  of  the  Bell  Telephone  Laboratories. 

There  he  built  a maze-solving  mouse,  used  to  study  circuitry  for  logic 
machines,  and  worked  on  a chess-playing  machine,  which  may  be  regarded 
as  the  first  step  in  the  construction  of  computers  for  evaluating  military 
situations  and  deciding  the  best  move.  At  one  time,  he  was  an  expert  tightrope 
walker  and  unicycle  rider  and  could  be  seen  riding  his  one-wheeler  up  and 
down  the  halls  of  the  Bell  Laboratories.  These  proficiencies  resulted  from  his 
attempts  to  design  a form  of  Pogo  stick  that  would  bounce  around  by  itself ; 
this  never  materialized,  but  he  did  succeed  in  producing  a bicycle  that  main- 
tained its  own  balance.  He  has  been  teaching  at  M.I.T.  since  1956.  A thin 
(135  pounds  on  a five-foot,  ten-inch  frame),  shy  man,  he  likes  science  fiction, 
jazz,  chess,  and  mathematics  and  admits  to  changing  hobbies  very  rapidly. 
He  lives  with  his  wife  and  co-worker,  Betty,  and  their  three  children  in  a 
house  full  of  awards  and  honors  in  Winchester,  Massachusetts. 

“During  World  War  II,”  he  has  said,  “Bell  Labs  were  working  on  secrecy 
systems.  I’d  worked  on  communication  systems  and  I was  appointed  to  some 
of  the  committees  studying  cryptanalytic  techniques.  The  work  on  both  the 
mathematical  theory  of  communications  and  the  cryptology  went  forward 
concurrently  from  about  1941.  I worked  on  both  of  them  together  and  1 had 
some  of  the  ideas  while  working  on  the  other.  1 wouldn't  say  one  came  before 
the  other — they  were  so  close  together  you  couldn’t  separate  them.”  Though 
the  work  on  both  was  substantially  complete  by  about  1944,  he  continued 
polishing  them  until  their  publication  as  separate  papers  in  the  abstruse  Bell 
System  Technical  Journal  in  1948  and  1949. 

Both  articles — “A  Mathematical  Theory  of  Communication”  and  “Com- 
munication Theory  of  Secrecy  Systems” — present  their  ideas  in  densely 
mathematical  form,  pocked  with  phrases  like  “this  inverse  must  exist  uniquely” 
and  expressions  like  “TjR^TkR,)-  ‘TmRn.”  But  Shannon’s  terse  and  incisive 
style  breathes  life  into  them.  The  first  paper  gave  birth  to  information  theory; 
the  second  dealt  with  cryptology  in  information-theory  terms. 

Chief  among  their  new  concepts  is  that  of  redundancy.  Redundancy 
retains,  in  information  theory,  the  essence  of  its  lay  meaning  of  needless 
excess,  but  it  is  refined  and  extended.  Roughly,  redundancy  means  that  more 
symbols  are  transmitted  in  a message  than  are  actually  needed  to  bear  the 
information.  To  take  Shannon’s  own  elementary  example,  the  u of  qu  is 
redundant  because  q is  always  followed  by  u in  English  words.  Many  of  the 
the' s of  ordinary  language  are  redundant:  persons  sending  telegrams  get 
along  without  them.  Just  how  great  the  excess  of  symbols  is  in  English  words 
is  vividly  demonstrated  by  some  of  those  Army  or  Air  Force  adjutant-general 
communications  that  take  off  into  a wild  blue  yonder  of  abbreviated  words 
and  phrases  like  “Off  pres  on  AD  for  an  indef  per.”  The  initiated  usually  has 
no  trouble  in  understanding  this  as  what  would  normally  be  written,  “Officer 
present  on  active  duty  for  an  indefinite  period.” 


745 


The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology 

Redundancy  arises  from  the  excess  of  rules  with  which  languages  burden 
themselves.  These  rules  are  mostly  prohibitions — “Thou  shalt  not  say  ‘dese’  or 
‘dose’  for  ‘ these ’ or  ‘ those “Thou  shalt  not  spell  ‘separate’  as  ‘seperate’”; 
“Thou  shalt  not  say  ‘is’  after  ‘I.’  ” All  such  limitations  exclude  perfectly  usable 
combinations  of  letters.  If  a language  permitted  any  permutation  of,  say,  four 
letters  to  be  a word,  such  as  “ngwv,”  then  456,976  words  would  exist.  This  is 
approximately  the  number  of  entries  in  an  unabridged  English  dictionary. 
Such  a language  could,  therefore,  express  the  same  amount  of  information  as 
English.  But  because  English  prohibits  such  combinations  as  “ngwv,”  it 
must  go  beyond  the  four-letter  limit  to  express  its  ideas.  Thus  English  is 
more  wasteful,  more  redundant  than  this  hypothetical  four-letter  language. 

The  rules  that  lead  to  redundancy  come  from  grammar  (“I  am,”  not  “I 
is”),  phonetics  (no  word  in  English  may  begin  with  ng ),  idiom  (“believe” 
alone  may  not  be  followed  by  an  infinitive,  only  by  a clause  beginning  with 
“that”).  Others  come  from  etymology,  in  which  the  derivation  of  a word 
has  left  many  now-silent  letters,  as  in  “through”  or  “knight.”  Still  others 
come  from  limitations  on  vocabulary.  A teen-ager  who  uses  “swell”  to  mean 
what  an  adult  might  designate  by  a dozen  different  terms  of  approbation 
utters  speech  that  is  much  more  redundant,  more  restricted,  less  variable,  less 
flexible  than  the  adult’s.  As  Shannon  wrote,  “Two  extremes  of  redundancy  in 
English  prose  are  represented  by  Basic  English  and  by  James  Joyce’s  book 
Finnegans  Wake.  The  Basic  English  vocabulary  is  limited  to  850  words  and 
the  redundancy  is  very  high.  This  is  reflected  in  the  expansion  that  occurs 
when  a passage  is  translated  into  Basic  English.  Joyce  on  the  other  hand 
enlarges  the  vocabulary  and  is  alleged  to  achieve  a compression  of  semantic 
content.” 

Two  other  sources  of  redundancy  are  of  particular  importance  for  their 
role  in  determining  the  frequency  table.  One  derives  from  the  relationships  to 
which  human  beings  refer  so  often  and  which  language  necessarily  reflects. 
These  are  the  relations  of  one  person  to  another  (“the  son  of  John”),  of 
one  object  to  another  (“the  book  on  the  table”),  of  an  object  to  an  action 
(“put  it  down”).  English  expresses  many  of  these  relationships  by  separate 
words,  called  “function  words.”  Pronouns,  prepositions,  articles,  conjunc- 
tions are  all  function  words.  Some  stand  for  purely  grammatical  relationships 
that  serve  as  a kind  of  linguistic  shorthand — saying  “I”  instead  of  repeating 
one’s  name  all  the  time.  Function  words  mean  nothing  standing  alone.  Yet 
they  are  among  the  most  common  words  in  English  because  the  relationships 
they  express  are  so  common.  In  English,  only  ten  of  these  words  constitute 
more  than  one  quarter  of  any  text:  the,  of,  and,  to,  a,  in,  that,  it,  is,  and  I 
totalled  26,677  of  100,000  words  in  a count  made  by  Godfrey  Dewey.  In- 
evitably this  preponderance  will  affect  the  frequency  table.  H,  for  example, 
owes  most  of  its  occurrences  to  the. 

The  second  source  of  redundancy  stems  from  the  human  laziness  that 
favors  sounds  easier  to  pronounce  and  identify.  The  voiceless  stops  / p t k / 


746 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


require  less  energy  to  articulate  than  the  corresponding  voiced  stops  /bdg/ 
and  they  average  twice  the  frequency  of  voiced  stops  in  sixteen  widely  varying 
languages  surveyed  by  George  K.  Zipf.  Similarly,  short  vowels  are  markedly 
more  frequent  than  long  vowels  or  diphthongs.  In  the  same  way,  auditors  of 
English,  at  least,  seem  to  prefer  sounds  that  are  easier  to  identify.  Tests  made 
with  nonsense  syllables  show  that  listeners  seldom  confuse  consonants  pro- 
duced with  the  vocal  organs  held  in  the  same  position  but  used  in  a different 
manner  (such  as  /ntrsdlz/),  but  usually  fail  to  distinguish  consonants  pro- 
duced with  the  vocal  organs  used  in  the  same  manner  but  held  in  different 
positions  (such  as  / p t k /).  In  the  first  group  (the  alveolar  consonants),  the 
tongue  stays  at  the  upper  gum  ridge  but  molds  or  interrupts  the  breath 
stream  in  different  ways.  In  the  second  group  (the  voiceless  stops),  all  the 
consonants  block  the  breath  stream  and  explosively  release  it,  but  at  different 
positions  of  the  lips  and  tongue.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  easy-to- 
identify  alveolar  consonants  comprise  seven  of  the  eight  more-frequent 
consonants  in  English,  while  the  two  stops  that  are  not  alveolar  (/ p k /)  lie 
well  down  in  the  frequency  table.  Incidentally,  this  preference  for  easily 
distinguishable  consonants  is  one  of  the  few  explanations  for  the  arrangement 
of  even  a few  of  the  letters  in  the  English  frequency  table.* 

All  these  prohibitions  and  rules  and  tendencies  help  create  redundancy. 
English  is  about  75  per  cent  redundant. f In  other  words,  about  three  quarters 
of  English  text  is  “unnecessary.”  English  could  theoretically  express  the  same 
things  with  one  quarter  its  present  letters  if  it  were  wholly  nonredundant.  A 
literary  curiosity  demonstrates  graphically  how  a few  letters  carry  most  of  the 
information  of  a text  while  the  others  are  redundant.  The  curiosity  is  entitled 
“Death  and  Life”: 

cur  f w d dis  and  p 

A sed  iend  rought  eath  ease  ain 

bles  fr  b br  and  ag 

In  this,  65  per  cent  of  the  letters  are  in  the  central  row  (reading  it  twice),  and 
serve  both  contradictory  meanings  equally  well.  Thus  they  add  nothing  to  the 
information  of  the  passage,  all  of  which  is  carried  in  the  remaining  35  per 
cent. 

Anyone  who  knows  English  will  know  the  rules  of  spelling  and  grammar 
and  pronunciation  that  help  engender  its  redundancy,  and  he  will  know  these 
rules  prior  to  the  receipt  of  any  new  text  in  the  language.  This  is  almost 
tautological:  it  is  only  the  existence  of  such  rules  that  makes  communication 
possible.  If  a hearer  interprets  “to”  to  mean  “from,”  he  will  not  understand 
very  much.  If  he  pronounces  a written  m as  / v /,  a 1 as  / s /,  and  so  on,  he  will 
not  get  through  to  his  listeners.  These  redundant  elements,  these  rules,  may 
be  considered  the  invariant  portion  of  language.  They  may  not  be  changed

without  loss  of  comprehension.  But  one  may  say  what  he  wishes  as  long  as 
he  follows  them.  They  are  the  preexistent  mold  into  which  the  free-will 
portion  of  a communication  is  poured.  Hence  the  enormous  range  ot  texts, 
from  laws  to  poems,  in  the  same  language — which  is  to  say,  following  the 
same  rules. 

If  one  hears  the  fragment  “It’s  not  hard  for  you  to  . . . ,”  the  redundant 
elements  say  that  a verb  is  likely  to  follow,  although  the  free-will  portion 
makes  it  impossible  to  know  which  one.  This  same  prior  knowledge,  or,  in 
other  words,  the  redundant  elements,  detects  and  corrects  errors  that  arise 
during  the  transmission  of  messages.  This  is  why  language  tolerates  so  heavy 
a burden  of  redundancy.  For  example,  if  a dot  is  dropped  in  a telegraphed 
message  in  English,  so  that  an  i (••)  becomes  an  e (•)  and  individual  becomes 
“endividual,”  the  recipient  will  know  that  an  error  was  made  because  English 
lacks  the  sequence  “endividual.”  But  if  the  language  used  were  the  hypotheti- 
cal four-letter  language,  in  which  all  sequences  of  four  letters  were  used  and 
therefore  all  were  potentially  acceptable  in  the  message,  the  same  dropping 
of  a dot  would  go  undetected.  “Xfim,”  meaning  perhaps  “come,”  would  be 
changed  to  “xfem,”  maybe  meaning  “go”  and,  without  redundancy,  no 
alarm  bells  would  ring.  (There  is,  of  course,  a higher  order  of  redundancy— 
that  mandated  by  context — which  might  sound  the  alarm.  If  “xfem"  meant 
“green,”  it  would  not  fit  the  context.  A perfectly  nonredundant  language  can 
therefore  probably  not  exist,  since  at  least  a few  basic  agreements  that  a few 
recurring  experiences  of  the  real  world  will  be  represented  by  the  same  verbal 
symbols  appear  to  be  essential  for  communication.) 

Where  the  language  has  no  redundancy — as  with  telephone  numbers, 
where  a single  wrong  digit  can  lead  to  a wrong  connection — people  put  in 
their  own  redundancy.  They  repeat  the  number  in  giving  it  to  someone.  Or,  in 
spelling  out  names,  they  say  “b  as  in  baby,  not  v as  in  Victor.”  For  the  greater 
the  redundancy,  the  easier  it  becomes  to  detect  mistakes.  If  a language 
consisted  only  of  alternations  of  consonants  and  vowels,  any  deviation  from 
that  pattern  would  flag  an  error. 

This  detection  of  errors  is  the  first  step  toward  their  correction.  And  in 
this  correction  redundancy  again  plays  the  central  role.  After  the  recipient  of 
“endividual”  has  hunted  through  his  memory  and  his  dictionary  and  found 
that  it  does  not  exist  in  English,  he  brings  up  the  sequence  “individual, 
which  does  exist,  from  his  store  of  prior  information  about  English,  and 
corrects  his  message.  If  the  reader  of  a business  letter  sees  the  sequence  “rhe 
company,”  he  will  recognize  “rhe"  as  a nonword,  will  remember  that  the 
rules  of  English  often  call  for  a similar-appearing  group  of  letters,  "the,”  be- 
fore a noun  like  “company,”  will  perhaps  consider  that  r is  near  t on  the  type- 
writer keyboard,  and  then  will  conclude  that  “rhe"  should  be  "the. 

This  process  is  a first  cousin  to  cryptanalysis. 

For  cryptanalysts  bring  to  bear  in  their  solutions  the  same  prior  knowledge 
of  rules  and  spelling  and  phonetic  preferences  (that  is,  redundancy)  that  the 


748 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

ordinary  reader  does  to  correct  a typographical  error.  What  laymen  do  with 
accidental  errors,  cryptanalysts  do  with  deliberate  deformations.  Of  course  a 
cryptogram  is  immensely  more  involved  and  obscure  than  an  isolated  mis- 
print, but  it  has  an  underlying  regularity  that  the  single  random  error  does 
not,  and  this  structure  assists  and  confirms  the  successive  “corrections”  that 
constitute  a cryptanalysis. 

But  how  does  the  cryptanalyst  begin  in  the  first  place  ? In  correcting  a typo- 
graphical error,  all  the  redundant  elements  lie  in  plain  view,  ready  for  use. 
With  a cryptogram,  they  are  obscured.  The  cryptanalyst  begins  by  breaking 
these  elements  down  to  their  atomic  form — letters.  He  then  compares  them  to 
the  redundant  elements  of  a language  that  have  been  reduced  to  the  same 
common  denominator.  In  other  words,  he  takes  a frequency  count  of  the 
letters  of  the  cryptogram  and  matches  it  against  a frequency  count  of  the  letters 
of  the  assumed  plaintext  language.  (These  counts  must  sometimes  be  modified 
by  the  conditions  of  the  cipher.  In  polyalphabetics,  a count  must  be  made  for 
each  alphabet;  in  digraphics,  the  count  must  be  of  pairs.  If  the  cryptogram 
is  in  code,  the  atomic  forms  are  words,  but  the  same  principle  applies.) 

Having  done  this,  how  can  the  cryptanalyst  be  confident  that  the  crypto- 
gram's plaintext  will  have  approximately  the  same  frequencies  as  those  of 
plaintext  in  general?  Why  won't  the  differences  in  subjects  of  discussion,  in 
vocabulary,  in  expression,  upset  the  frequencies?  Because  the  redundant 
elements  of  language  far  outweigh  the  variable  ones.  The  75  per  cent  redund- 
ancy in  English  overwhelms  the  25  per  cent  of  “free  will”— though  this  25  per 
cent  does  keep  frequency  counts  from  matching  one  another  exactly.  The 
redundant  elements  in  any  text  converge  to  make  its  frequency  table.  The 
need  in  any  English  text  to  use  “the”  frequently  ensures  that  h will  be  a high- 
frequency  letter.  English’s  preference  for  alveolar  consonants  will  make  n,  t, 
r,  s,  d,  and  / all  high-  or  medium-frequency  letters.  The  language’s  aversion 
to  p and  k keeps  their  frequencies  low.  These  redundant  elements  are  fixed 
and  predetermined— necessarily  so,  if  communication  is  to  take  place— and 
hence  they  stabilize  the  frequency  tables  that  reflect  them.  The  enormous 
preponderance  of  redundancy  manifests  itself  in  the  closely  equal  proportions 
of  e in  the  nine  separate  German  frequency  counts.  And  of  course  it  manifests 
itself  in  the  daily  successes  of  cryptanalysts. 

Shannon’s  insight,  his  great  contribution  to  cryptology,  lay  in  pointing 
out  that  redundancy  furnishes  the  ground  for  cryptanalysis.  “In  ...  the 
majority  of  ciphers,”  he  wrote,  “it  is  only  the  existence  of  redundancy  in  the 
original  messages  that  makes  a solution  possible.”  This  is  the  very  basis  of 
codebreaking.  Shannon  has  here  given  an  explanation  for  the  constancy  of 
letter  frequency,  and  hence  for  the  phenomena  that  depend  on  it,  such  as 
cryptanalysis.  He  has  thus  made  possible,  for  the  first  time,  a fundamental 
understanding  of  the  process  of  cryptogram  solution. 

From  this  insight  flow  several  corollaries.  It  follows  that  the  lower  the 
redundancy,  the  more  difficult  it  is  to  solve  a cryptogram.  Shannon’s  own 


749 


The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology 

two  extremes  of  redundancy  illustrate  this.  The  last  few  words  of  Finnegans 
Wake  are  these:  “End  here.  Us  then.  Finn,  again!  Take.  Bussoftlee,  meme- 
mormee!  Till  thousendsthee.  Lps.  The  keys  to.  Given!  A way  a lone  a last  a 
loved  a long  the.”  This  would  interpose  distinctly  more  difficulties  to  a 
cryptanalyst  than  a portion  of  the  New  Testament  in  Basic  English:  “And  the 
disciples  were  full  of  wonder  at  his  words.  But  Jesus  said  to  them  again. 
Children,  how  hard  it  is  for  those  who  put  faith  in  wealth  to  come  into  the 
kingdom  of  God!” 

Puzzle  cryptograms  achieve  their  goal  of  being  as  hard  as  possible  to 
solve  by  using  archaic  and  esoteric  words  dredged  from  the  far  corners  of  the 
dictionary  and  combined  in  almost  meaningless  texts.  Their  redundancy  is 
relatively  low.  One  such  cryptogram  gives  a self-description:  Tough  cryptos 
contain  traps  snaring  unwary  solvers:  abnormal  frequencies,  consonantal  com- 
binations unthinkable,  terminals  freakish,  quaint  twisters  like  "myrrh.'  But  even 
here  the  redundant  elements  win  out.  Though  a few  may  be  suppressed, 
others  remain,  and  these  permit  solution.  The  interesting  question  of  whether 
the  differences  in  redundancy  among  natural  languages  make  cryptograms  in 
some  inherently  more  difficult  to  solve  seems  never  to  have  been  put  to  a test. 

The  problem  of  low  redundancy  arises  in  practice  with  a vengeance  when 
the  cryptanalyst  is  faced  with  enciphered  code.  To  strip  the  encipherment 
from  encicode,  the  cryptanalyst  must  solve  a cryptogram  whose  plaintext 
consists  of  codewords  and  which  may  look  like  ixkdywukjtplkje.  . . . This 
is  of  very  low  redundancy  because  of  the  more  even  use  of  letters,  the  greater 
freedom  in  combining  them,  the  suppression  of  frequencies  by  the  use  of 
homophones,  and  so  on.  But  the  unavoidable  repetitions  of  orders  and  reports, 
the  pressure  of  the  redundancy  of  the  language  pent  within  the  vessel  of  the 
code,  and  the  engineering  of  codewords  so  that  garbles  can  be  corrected— all 
these  give  the  underlying  codetext  a fibrous  enough  texture  for  the  crypt- 
analyst to  grasp  it  for  solution. 

These  considerations  suggest  that  reducing  the  redundancy  will  hinder 
cryptanalysis.  Shannon  himself  prescribes  operating  on  the  plaintext  “with  a 
transducer  which  removes  all  redundancies.  . . . The  fact  that  the  vowels  in  a 
passage  can  be  omitted  without  essential  loss  suggests  a simple  way  of  greatly 
improving  almost  any  ciphering  system.  First  delete  all  vowels,  or  as  much  of 
the  message  as  possible  without  running  the  risk  of  multiple  reconstructions, 
and  then  encipher  the  residue."  Experts  who  have  attacked  cryptograms  from 
whose  plaintexts  only  the  letter  e has  been  eliminated  have  found  that  the 
difficulty  of  solution  increased  noticeably.  Reducing  redundancy  is  especially 
effective  because  it  robs  the  cryptanalyst  of  one  of  his  chief  tools  for  attack 
instead  of  just  bolstering  the  wall  of  secrecy.  Cryptographers  of  the  Italian 
Renaissance  did  this  when  they  ordered  cipher  clerks  to  drop  the  second  letter 
of  a doublet,  as  the  second  / in  sigillo. 

Such  techniques  rely  upon  the  cipher  clerks'  knowledge  of  their  language 
to  supply  the  suppressed  elements  of  redundancy.  Abbreviations  likewise  may 


750 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


have  such  low  redundancy,  may  require  such  an  extensive  furnishing  of 
information,  as  bn  for  battalion,  that  they  may  not  only  make  plaintexts 
harder  to  solve,  but  may  themselves  function  as  a rough  form  of  crypto- 
graphy. Two  gossips,  for  example,  may  refer  to  a third  party  by  her  initials. 
They  hope  that  no  one  within  hearing  will  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  the 
contextual  situation  to  restore  the  eliminated  portion  of  the  name.  Much  of 
the  Masonic  ritual  is  printed  in  that  form:  “Do  u declr,  upn  ur  honr,  tt  u r 
promptd  to.  . . .” 

Another  corollary  is  that  more  text  is  needed  to  solve  a low-redundancy 
cryptogram  than  one  with  a high-redundancy  plaintext.  Shannon  has  managed 
to  quantify  the  amount  of  material  needed  to  achieve  a unique  and  unambi- 
guous solution  when  the  plaintext  has  a known  degree  of  redundancy.  He 
calls  the  number  of  letters  the  “unicity  distance”  (or  “unicity  point”),  and  he 
calculates  it  by  means  of  a rather  complicated  formula.  This  formula  natur- 
ally differs  for  different  ciphers,  but  it  always  includes  the  redundancy  as  one 
of  its  terms.  In  his  original  paper,  in  which  he  considered  the  redundancy  of 
English  at  only  50  per  cent,  Shannon  found  the  unicity  point  for  mon- 
alphabetic  substitution  at  27  letters,  for  polyalphabetics  with  known  alpha- 
bets at  twice  the  period  length,  for  those  with  unknown  alphabets  at  53  times 
the  period  length,  for  transposition  at  the  keylength  times  the  logarithm  of 
the  keylength  factorial. 

One  of  the  most  interesting  uses  of  the  unicity-point  formula  is  in  deter- 
mining the  validity  of  an  alleged  solution  to  a cryptogram,  especially  one  of 
the  questionable  solutions,  such  as  those  claimed  to  be  hidden  in  the  Shakes- 
pearean plays  to  prove  that  Francis  Bacon  wrote  them.  “In  general,”  wrote 
Shannon,  “we  may  say  that  if  a proposed  system  and  key  solves  a cryptogram 
for  a length  of  material  considerably  greater  than  the  unicity  distance  the 
solution  is  trustworthy.  If  the  material  is  of  the  same  order  or  shorter  than  the 
unicity  distance  the  solution  is  highly  suspicious.”  Shannon’s  formula  was 
not  applied  to  most  of  these  “decipherments”  because  most  were  published 
before  his  work  was;  furthermore,  the  formula  would  ramify  to  unmanage- 
able terms  to  account  for  the  many  subrules  and  exceptions  in  these  extremely 
flexible  “systems.”  It  triumphed  in  its  only  known  combat  action — one  that 
took  place  in  the  pages  of  Life  magazine  on  a solution  proposed  by  lb  Mel- 
chior, son  of  the  opera  star  Lauritz  Melchior. 

Melchior  thought  that  the  decipherment  of  a cryptogram  that  he  detected 
on  Shakespeare’s  tombstone  might  lead  him  to  an  early  text  of  a play.  He 
obtained  a numerical  ciphertext  by  counting  the  number  of  successive  capitals 
and  small  letters  in  the  epitaph  on  Shakespeare’s  grave.  This  he  solved  to  read : 
elesennrelaledelleemnaamleetedeeasen.  But  the  eleven  letters  ledelleemna  made 
no  sense  to  Melchior,  and,  noting  that  they  came  from  the  letters  between  the 
two  the  ligatures  on  the  tombstone,  he  concluded  that  they  were  change 
symbols  to  signal  a shift  in  cipher  alphabets.  With  this  change,  the  new 
“solution”  read:  elesennrelaedewedgeeereamleetedeeasen.  Taking  away  the 


751 


The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology 

“obvious  nulls”  and  modernizing  the  Elizabethan  spelling,  Melchior  read : 
Elsinore  laid  wedge  first  Hamlet  edition.  This  was  supposed  to  mean  that  a 
first  edition  of  Hamlet  was  buried  in  a wedge-shaped  cell  deep  within  the 
castle  of  Elsinore.  But  even  granting  the  generously  low  redundancy  of  only 
50  per  cent,  a crucial  section  of  the  cipher  flunks  the  Shannon  unicity  test 
completely,  while  the  remaining  letters  barely  meet  the  minimum  and  do 
not  fulfill  the  requirement  for  a “length  of  material  considerably  greater  than 
the  unicity  distance.”  Despite  this  implied  prediction  of  failure,  Melchior, 
backed  by  a Life  expedition,  went  to  Elsinore  anyway.  Cryptologists  were  not 
surprised  when  the  team  brought  back  an  excellent  picture  story  for  the 
magazine — but  no  “first  Hamlet  edition.” 

The  concept  of  redundancy  thus  repeatedly  demonstrates  its  power  by 
bringing  under  a single  broad  generalization  numerous  cryptologic  pheno- 
mena that  had  heretofore  to  be  given  individual  explanations.  Why  are 
puzzle  cryptograms  harder  to  solve  than  ordinary  messages?  Previously, 
cryptanalysts  could  only  say  that  it  was  because  they  used  rarer  and  odder 
words;  today  they  can  invoke  the  wide-ranging  principle  of  redundancy  and 
point  out  that  such  cryptograms  have  a lower  redundancy  than  the  normal 
ones.  Why  have  stereotyped  expressions— “Reference  your  telegram  of.  . 
—so  often  helped  cryptanalysts?  Because  they  raise  the  redundancy  to 
delightfully  high  levels.  On  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  codenames  for  places, 
operations,  and  so  forth,  within  a plaintext  lowers  redundancy.  As  General 
Marcel  Givierge  wrote,  “the  fact  that  one  expects  to  find  Paris  in  a text  will 
cause  him  to  search  for  the  letters  and  syllables  in  Paris  and  not  that  of  the 
codename  which  replaces  Paris.”  Similarly,  bisection  of  a message  cutting 
it  in  half  and  tacking  the  start  onto  the  end— buries  the  frequently  routine 
start  of  a message  in  the  middle  and  brings  the  middle  of  a phrase  to  the  head 
of  the  message.  This  substantially  lowers  the  redundancy  of  that  vulnerable 
point.  Shannon’s  information  theory  shows  how  to  make  cryptanalysis  more 
difficult  and  tells  how  much  ciphertext  is  needed  to  reach  a valid  solution.  In 
all  these  ways  it  has  contributed  to  a deeper  understanding  of  cryptology. 

Shannon  has  also  viewed  cryptology  from  a couple  of  other  perspectives, 
which,  while  not  as  useful  as  information  theory,  are  enlightening.  The  first, 
in  fact,  is  a kind  of  corollary  to  the  information-theory  view. 

“From  the  point  of  view  of  the  cryptanalyst,”  Shannon  wrote,  “a 
secrecy  system  is  almost  identical  with  a noisy  communication  system.  In 
information  theory,  the  term  “noise”  has  a special  meaning.  Noise  is  any 
unpredictable  disturbance  that  creates  transmission  errors  in  any  channel  of 
communication.  Examples  are  static  on  the  radio,  “snow”  on  a television 
screen,  misprints,  background  chatter  at  a cocktail  party,  fog,  a bad 
connection  on  the  telephone,  a foreign  accent,  perhaps  even  mental  pre- 
conceptions. Shannon  is  suggesting  that  noise  is  analogous  to  encipherment. 
“The  chief  differences  in  the  two  cases,”  he  wrote,  “are:  first,  that  the  operation 


752 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


of  the  enciphering  transformation  is  generally  of  a more  complex  nature  than 
the  perturbing  noise  in  a channel;  and,  second,  the  key  for  a secrecy  system  is 
usually  chosen  from  a finite  set  of  possibilities  while  the  noise  in  a channel  is 
more  often  continually  introduced,  in  effect  chosen  from  an  infinite  set.” 

When  Carl  W.  Helstrom,  author  of  Statistical  Theory  of  Signal  Detection, 
was  asked  whether  the  techniques  of  isolating  signals  from  noise  had  any 
relevance  to  cryptanalysis,  he  replied:  “I  suspect  that  the  analogy  between 
the  enciphering  rule  of  ‘key’  and  random  noise  will  not  prove  very  fruitful.  It 
seems  to  me  more  appropriate  to  regard  the  encipherment  as  a filtering  of  the 
original  message  to  produce  a transformed  version.  The  ‘filter’  is  a definite 
transformation  rule,  but  the  analyst  doesn’t  know  what  it  is.  . . . The  problem 
is  then  to  discover  the  transformation  rule,  or  the  nature  of  the  filter,  when 
given  the  statistics  of  the  input  and  output.  It  is  like  finding  the  structure  of 
an  electrical  filter  by  passing  random  noise  through  it  and  measuring  the 
statistical  distributions  of  the  input  and  output  voltages.” 

Cryptology  may  also  be  regarded  as  a conflict  in  the  sense  employed  in  The 
Theory  of  Games  and  Economic  Behavior  by  John  Von  Neumann  and  Oskar 
Morgenstern.  As  Shannon,  who  first  made  the  allusion,  puts  it:  “The  situation 
between  the  cipher  designer  and  cryptanalyst  can  be  thought  of  as  a ‘game’  of 
a very  simple  structure;  a zero-sum  two-person  game  with  complete  informa- 
tion, and  just  two  ‘moves.’  [A  zero-sum  game  is  one  in  which  one  contestant’s 
advances  are  made  at  the  expense  of  the  other.]  The  cipher  designer  chooses  a 
system  for  his  ‘move.’  Then  the  cryptanalyst  is  informed  of  this  choice  and 
chooses  a method  of  analysis.  The  ‘value’  of  the  play  is  the  average  work 
required  to  break  a cryptogram  in  the  system  by  the  method  chosen.” 

Cryptology  is,  by  definition,  a social  activity,  and  so  it  may  be  examined 
from  a sociological  point  of  view.  It  is  secret  communication,  and  communi- 
cation is  perhaps  man’s  most  complex  and  varied  activity.  It  encompasses  not 
just  words  but  gestures,  facial  expressions,  tone  of  voice,  even  silence.  A glance 
can  express  a tale  more  sweetly  than  a rhyme.  Basically,  all  forms  of  com- 
munication are  sets  of  agreements  that  certain  sounds  or  signs  or  symbols 
shall  stand  for  certain  things.  One  must  be  a party  to  these  preconcerted  rules 
if  one  wants  to  communicate. 

But  all  forms  of  communication  are  not  at  all  times  and  all  places  known. 
Those  who  happen  to  know  one  system  that  others  around  them  do  not  can 
use  it  for  secret  communication.  Irish  troops  sent  to  the  Congo  as  part  of  the 
United  Nations  force  in  1960  spoke  Gaelic  over  the  radio,  and  the  U.N. 
commander,  General  Carl  von  Horn  of  Sweden,  called  it  the  best  code  in  the 
Congo.  This  is  a kind  of  cryptography  by  default,  depending  upon  a fortui- 
tous ignorance — a defective  cryptography.  Effective  cryptography  deliberately 
establishes  special  rules  of  communication  that  deny  information  to  those 
who  would  otherwise  understand  the  messages. 

This  withholding  of  information  constitutes  the  essential  element  of  that 
which  is  called  “secrecy.”  All  the  manifestations  of  secrecy — hiding  places, 


753 


The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology 

disguises,  locked  doors— share  the  basic  idea  of  not  communicating  objects 
or  information.  Its  extreme  form  is  silence  (which  conjures  up  an  Orwellian 
nightmare  of  the  extreme  form  of  eavesdropping— detection  and  interpreta- 
tion of  brain  waves).  An  exhaustive  investigation  of  the  concept  of  secrecy 
would  require,  as  Maurits  de  Vries  has  pointed  out,  “a  complete  examination 
of  the  relations  between  individuals  and  between  groups  in  our  society, 
because  secrecy  is  the  antithesis  of  communication,  and  communication — as 
that  which  makes  man  a social  being— encompasses  all  aspects  of  cultural 
behavior.  Cryptography  combines  these  antitheses  into  a single  operation; 
a wag  might  define  it  as  “noncommunicating  communication.” 

The  relation  between  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis  is  not  logically 
necessary;  it  is  contingent.  One  can  envision  men  communicating  by  secret 
means  with  others  not  even  thinking  of  prying.  But  in  the  real  world,  the 
cryptanalyst — or  more  accurately  the  potential  cryptanalyst — comes  first. 
What  need  for  cryptography  if  no  one  would  eavesdrop?  Why  build  forts  if 
no  one  would  attack?  Thus  the  assumption  that  someone  will  attempt  a 
cryptanalysis,  no  matter  how  tentatively  or  incompetently,  engenders 
cryptography. 

Experience  of  the  interreaction  between  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis 
has  precipitated  out  certain  practical  principles.  They  all  refer  to  time,  be- 
cause all  practical  matters  involving  mortal  men  connect  eventually  with  that 
one  inexorable,  irreversible,  irretrievable  factor. 

Time,  for  the  cryptographer,  controls  a variable  relationship.  The  most 
general  of  the  cryptographer’s  principles  deals  with  the  sliding  ratio  between 
speed  and  security;  as  the  need  for  speed  in  communications  increases,  the 
need  for  security  decreases.  Early  in  the  planning  of  a major  operation, 
messages  demand  great  security  because  the  enemy,  if  he  could  read  them, 
would  have  time  to  prepare  countermoves.  But  in  the  heat  of  battle,  com- 
manders may  use  plain  language  because  the  enemy,  though  he  intercepts  the 
messages,  may  not  have  time  to  react  effectively.  This  principle  arranges  a 
nation’s  cryptosystems  in  a hierarchy  in  which  front-line  systems  are  simple 
and  diplomatic  systems  secure  and  more  complex.  “Of  each  such  system,” 
Friedman  wrote,  “the  best  that  can  be  expected  is  that  the  degree  of  security 
be  great  enough  to  delay  solution  by  the  enemy  for  such  a length  of  time  that 
when  the  solution  is  finally  reached  the  information  thus  obtained  has  lost 
all  its  ‘short  term,’  immediate,  or  operational  value,  and  much  of  its  ‘long 
term,’  research,  or  historical  value.” 

The  paramount  requirement  for  all  cryptosystems  is  reliability.  This  means 
that  cryptograms  must  be  decipherable  without  ambiguity,  without  delay, 
and  without  error.  It  implies,  for  example,  that  cipher  machines  will  be 
sturdy  enough  to  withstand  ordinary  abuse  so  that  they  will  be  ready  to 
operate  properly  when  a message  comes  in.  Usually  the  simpler  the  system, 
the  more  reliable.  The  requirement  excludes  from  the  combat  zone  ciphers 
of  more  than  two  steps.  Any  encipherer’s  errors  or  garbles  should  be 


754 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

correctable  without  having  to  call  for  a retransmission.  This  bans  systems  in 
which  a single  error  garbles  the  message  from  the  point  of  error  on,  as  in 
autokey  ciphers  (such  systems  are  said  to  have  an  undesirable  error- 
propagation  characteristic).  Obviously,  if  a general  cannot  rely  upon  the 
validity  of  messages  that  come  out  of  his  cipher  machines,  the  cryptosystem 
is  worse  than  useless. 

Secondary  requirements  for  a cryptosystem  are  security  and  rapidity. 
Which  one  comes  first  depends  upon  the  needs  of  the  users.  Further  down  the 
scale  of  importance  stands  the  requirement  of  economy.  This  rules  out  any 
system  that  requires  several  men  to  encipher,  makes  the  ciphertext  more  than 
twice  as  long  as  the  plaintext,  or  is  too  complicated  or  expensive  to  manu- 
facture or  distribute. 

In  addition  to  these  general  requirements,  military  and  diplomatic  crypto- 
systems must  meet  two  specific  ones— both  first  enunciated  by  Kerckhoffs. 
The  first  rests  upon  the  almost  universal  employment  of  telegraphy  or  radio- 
telegraphy for  military  and  diplomatic  communications.  No  system  is 
acceptable  whose  cryptogram  characters  cannot  be  sent  in  Morse  code; 
excluded  are  squares,  angles,  crosses,  or  other  designs.  The  second  rests  upon 
a working  assumption  of  military  cryptography:  that  the  enemy  knows  in 
general  how  a cipher  works.  Secrecy  must  depend  upon  the  keys  used.  No 
method  is  acceptable  that  does  not  accede  to  this  requirement,  that  does  not 
provide  for  both  a general  system  and  specific  keys. 

For  the  cryptanalyst,  time’s  demands  remain  fixed.  Always  at  his  back  he 
hears  time’s  winged  chariot  hurrying  near.  He  seeks  to  get  out  his  solutions  as 
quickly  as  possible.  It  is  probably  true  that  a message  will  always  have  some 
historical  value,  but  that  is  small  comfort  to  a commander  who  does  not  get  a 
cryptanalysis  that  would  have  warned  him  of  an  enemy  attack  until  after  the 
attack  is  under  way.  The  factors  that  affect  the  time  required  to  solve  crypto- 
grams— aside  from  external  factors,  like  the  speed  of  sending  the  intercepts 
back  to  the  cryptanalyst— are  the  strength  of  the  system,  the  soundness  of  the 
regulations  for  its  use,  how  closely  the  cipher  clerks  follow  those  regulations, 
the  volume  of  text,  the  size  and  skill  of  the  cryptanalytic  organization,  and 
the  amount  and  character  of  collateral  information. 

Bringing  skill  into  the  picture  raises  the  question  of  whether  cryptanalysis 
is  a science  or  an  art.  It  is  both.  On  the  one  hand,  cryptanalysis— or,  more 
properly  in  this  context,  cryptanalytics— is  an  organized  body  of  knowledge. 

It  studies  and  controls  phenomena.  Its  whole  spirit  is  scientific,  but  that  of  an 
applied  science,  like  engineering.  On  the  other  hand,  cryptanalysis— here 
meaning  the  steps  performed  in  solution— clearly  depends  upon  personal 
ability.  Some  cryptanalysts  are  better  than  others.  In  this  sense,  cryptanalysis 
is  an  art.  So,  in  this  sense,  is  any  human  activity  that  demands  a certain  apti- 
tude for  its  superior  practice.  Yardley  said  that  outstanding  cryptanalysts 
were  gifted  with  “cipher  brains,”  and  rather  glamorized  the  faculty,  but  in 
fact  “cipher  brains”  are  just  the  cryptologic  manifestation  of  a general 


755 


The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology 

characteristic— talent  in  a given  field.  Who  possesses  “cipher  brains”  and 
why,  however,  raise  complicated  questions. 

Human  knowledge  not  only  cannot  answer  them  now,  it  does  not  even 
understand  how  the  mind  performs  the  basic  psychological  operation  of 
cryptanalysis — pattern  recognition.  How  the  brain  can  supply  the  missing 
letters  to  a fragment  of  plaintext  which  it  has  never  before  seen  resembles  such 
problems  as  how  one  can  read  words  in  a handwriting  one  has  never  seen  or 
recognize  a piece  of  music  as  Mozart’s  even  though  one  has  never  heard  it 
before.  These  problems  remain  among  the  still  unsolved  ones  of  psychology 
and  biochemistry,  as  convoluted  as  the  cerebral  cortex  and  molecular  chains 
which  may  hold  the  answer. 

Nor  does  anyone  know  the  emotional  bases  of  cryptology.  Freud  stated 
that  the  motivation  for  learning,  for  the  acquisition  of  knowledge,  derives 
ultimately  from  the  child’s  impulse  to  see  the  hidden  sexual  organs  of  adults 
and  other  children.  If  curiosity  is  a sublimation  of  this,  then  cryptanalysis 
may  be  even  more  positively  a manifestation  of  voyeurism.  This  view  has 
won  some  qualified  support.  Psychoanalyst  Theodor  Reik,  author  of  Listening 
with  the  Third  Ear,  The  Secret  Self  and  many  other  books,  replied  to  a query 
about  it:  “I  am  inclined  to  assume  that  there  is  at  the  bottom  of  the  wish  to 
break  a code  a continuation  of  the  infantile  desire  to  find  out  what  is  the 
secret  of  sexuality  which  the  parents  or  the  adult  hide  before  the  little  boy.  . . . 
1 think  that  it  is  . . . one  of  the  roots  of  scientific  inquiry,”  he  added,  suggest- 
ing the  Freudian  view  that  scientists,  art  critics,  and  anyone  else  whose  work 
involves  either  literal  or  figurative  looking  is  similarly  motivated.  Psycho- 
logist Erich  Fromm,  author  of  Escape  From  Freedom  and  May  Man  Prevail  ? 
conceded  that  the  voyeuristic  explanation  “may  sometimes  be  correct,  but  by 
no  means  as  generally  as  the  Freudians  believe.  The  eminent  psychiatrist  Karl 
Menninger  assented  to  the  idea,  adding  that  “this  is  not  a new  ‘theory. 

But  this  view  has  been  challenged,  and  by  a Freudian  psychiatrist.  Jeptha 
R.  Macfarlane  thought  that  cryptanalysis  represents  a power  drive.  “The 
codebreaker  isn’t  interested  in  the  content  of  the  message  but  in  the  solution 
of  the  code,”  he  said.  “He  does  not  take  a sneaking  interest  in  the  cryptogram 
but  pride  in  its  mastery.  Cryptanalysis  is  not  peeking  through  a keyhole.  It  is 
breaking  down  a door.”  Supporting  Macfarlane’s  hypothesis  are  remarks  by 
or  about  cryptanalysts.  Werner  Kunze  of  Pers  z,  excusing  his  lack  of  know- 
ledge of  the  results  of  his  work,  said  that  he  did  not  pay  much  attention  to 
what  the  messages  said,  and  lost  interest  after  the  system  had  been  solved— 
hardly  a voyeuristic  impulse!  Of  John  Wallis  it  was  said  that  he  “never  con- 
cerned himself  in  the  matter,  but  only  in  ye  art  & ingenuity.”  Even  the  experi- 
ence of  the  solvers  of  newspaper  cryptograms  attests  to  Macfarlane's  power 
explanation:  they  are  not  curious  about  the  answer,  they  only  want  to  solve 
the  puzzle. 

Though  the  evidence  seems  to  support  the  power  hypothesis  better,  neither 
it  nor  the  voyeuristic  one  has  ever  been  put  to  the  test.  Perhaps  part  of  the 


756 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


answer  to  the  apparent  contradiction  lies  in  the  theory  that  the  voyeuristic 
motivation  might  lead  a man  to  a general  interest  in  cryptanalysis  and  that 
the  power  drive  leads  him  to  success  in  specific  solutions. 

What  relation,  if  any,  these  explanations  have  to  those  for  an  interest  in 
cryptography,  in  inventing  secret  codes  and  unbreakable  ciphers,  is  not 
wholly  clear.  Reik  thought  this  interest  “might  be  a suspiciousness  that  others 
could  find  out  about  ourselves  (not  only  about  our  sex-life,  but  our  hostility, 
aggressiveness,  and  so  on)  and  a wish  to  prevent  them.”  Fromm’s  view  was 
not  dissimilar,  though  he  linked  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis:  “I  think  the 
interest  in  deciphering,  as  well  as  in  secret  codes,  may  have  a great  deal  to  do 
with  a person’s  relatedness  to  the  world,  and  specifically  with  the  sense  of 
aloneness  and  isolation  and  the  hope  that  he  might  find  the  related  soul  with 
whom  he  could  communicate  ...  the  world  is  closed  to  him  . . . and  hence  he 
has  to  decipher  what  is  not  meant  for  him.”  Psychologist  Harold  Greenwald, 
who  was  once  interested  in  cryptology,  wrote:  “The  patients  I have  seen  who 
were  interested  in  this  subject  seemed  to  display  another  motive  [than  voyeur- 
ism], Predominantly  they  were  the  kind  of  people  who  attempted  to  establish 
feelings  of  power  through  either  hiding  their  own  behavior  (putting  things  in 
secret  code)  or  discerning  the  things  that  others  wish  to  keep  secret  (breaking 
codes).”  A psychological  study  of  secrets  in  general  states  that  secrets  have 
their  origin  in  the  anal  stage  of  psychosexual  development.  This  implies  that 
cryptography  may  come  ultimately  from  the  infantile  sexual  pleasure  that 
Freud  says  children  obtain  from  the  muscle  tension  of  retaining  the 
feces. 

There  appear  to  be  as  many  theories  as  there  are  writers.  Ernest  Jones,  the 
distinguished  psychoanalyst  and  biographer  of  Freud,  put  his  finger  on  what 
may  be  a significant  point.  Many  youngsters  become  interested  in  cryptology 
when  they  are  12  or  13,  and  Jones  told  in  his  autobiography  how  “When  1 
was  nearly  twelve,  the  secretiveness  that  so  often  heralds  the  approach  of 
puberty  combined  with  an  always  strong  curiosity  to  impel  me  towards  a 
passionate  interest  in  ciphers,  about  which  I still  know  a good  deal.  1 devised 
one  myself  which  I was  satisfied  would  baffle  any  opponent;  I must  admit, 
however,  that  it  would  not  have  been  a convenient  code  for  purposes  of  rapid 
communication,  since  it  involved  the  interplay  of  so  many  subciphers  that  it 
took  the  best  part  of  a day  to  transcribe  a sentence  into  it.  The  complex,  thus 
allayed,  was  able  to  transmute  itself  into  a more  useful  form  . . . ,”  which  was 
shorthand.  Unfortunately,  Jones  never  said  why  he  thought  secretiveness  was 
related  to  puberty. 

Novelist  Aldous  Huxley  seemed  to  have  glimpsed  the  voyeuristic  idea  for 
cryptanalysis  and  inverted  it  into  antivoyeurism  as  an  explanation  for  crypto- 
graphy. In  Those  Barren  Leaves,  he  wrote: 

Did  she  love  me?  At  any  rate  she  often  said  so,  even  in  writing.  I have  all  her 

letters  still — a score  of  scribbled  notes  sent  up  by  messenger  from  one  wing  of  the 

Hotel  Cecil  to  the  other  and  a few  longer  letters  written  when  she  was  on  her 


757

holiday  or  week-ending  somewhere  apart  from  me.  Here,  I spread  out  the  sheets. 
It  is  a competent,  well-educated  writing;  the  pen  rarely  leaves  the  paper,  running 
on  from  letter  to  letter,  from  word  to  word.  A rapid  writing,  flowing,  clear  and 
legible.  Only  here  and  there,  generally  towards  the  ends  of  her  brief  notes,  is  the 
clarity  troubled;  there  are  scrawled  words  made  up  of  formless  letters.  I pore 
over  them  in  an  attempt  to  interpret  their  meaning.  “I  adore  you,  my  beloved . . . 
kiss  you  a thousand  times  . . . long  for  it  to  be  night . . . love  you  madly.”  These 
are  the  fragmentary  meanings  I contrive  to  disengage  from  the  scribbles.  We 
write  such  things  illegibly  for  the  same  reason  as  we  clothe  our  bodies.  Modesty 
does  not  permit  us  to  walk  naked,  and  the  expression  of  our  most  intimate 
thoughts,  our  most  urgent  desires  and  secret  memories,  must  not — even  when  we 
have  so  far  done  violence  to  ourselves  as  to  commit  the  words  to  paper — be  too 
easily  read  and  understood.  Pepys,  when  he  recorded  the  most  scabrous  details 
of  his  loves,  is  not  content  with  writing  in  cipher;  he  breaks  into  bad  French  as 
well.  And  I remember,  now  that  I mention  Pepys,  having  done  the  same  sort  of 
thing  in  my  own  letters  to  Barbara;  winding  up  with  a “Bellissima,  ti  voglio  un 
bene  enorme,”  or  a “Je  t’embrasse  en  peu  partout.” 

This  is  illuminating,  though  no  more  conclusive  than  the  other  theories. 
But  if  the  psychological  roots  of  cryptology  remain  obscure,  the  biological 
roots  are  clear.  Those  roots  reach  back  through  the  eons  to  the  first  protozoa 
struggling  for  life  in  the  warm  seas  of  the  primordial  earth.  For  cryptography 
and  cryptanalysis,  though  they  are  highly  sophisticated  technologies,  retain 
at  their  inmost  cores,  like  chromosomes  that  determine  their  heredity,  the 
most  primitive  of  functions. 

Cryptography  is  protection.  It  is  to  that  extension  of  modern  man — 
communications — what  the  carapace  is  to  the  turtle,  ink  to  the  squid,  camou- 
flage to  the  chameleon.  Cryptanalysis  corresponds  to  the  senses.  Like  the  ear 
of  the  bat,  the  chemical  sensitivity  of  an  amoeba,  the  eye  of  an  eagle,  it 
collects  information  about  the  outside  world. 

The  objective  is  self-preservation.  This  is  the  first  law  of  life,  as  imperative 
for  a body  politic  as  for  an  individual  organism.  And  if  biological  evolution 
demonstrates  anything,  it  is  that  intelligence  best  secures  that  goal.  Know- 
ledge is  power.  In  an  atmosphere  of  competition,  it  may  exist  in  two  modes: 
mine  and  mine  enemy’s.  All  organisms  attempt  to  maximize  the  former  and 
minimize  the  latter.  Cryptography  and  cryptanalysis  exemplify  the  two 
modes.  Cryptography  seeks  to  conserve  in  exclusivity  a nation’s  store  of 
knowledge,  cryptanalysis  to  increase  that  store. 

But  knowledge  alone  is  not  power.  To  have  any  effect  it  must  be  linked  to 
physical  force.  Cryptology,  like  the  services  of  supply  and  transportation  and 
administration,  aids  the  fighting  troops  that  constitute  a main  element  of 
national  power.  Nations  use  that  power  to  advance  their  political  and  social 
goals.  Cryptography  and  cryptanalysis  are  means  to  those  ends.  And  that  is 
their  position  in  the  ultimate  scheme  of  things. 

Even  when  the  ends  that  they  serve  are  purely  defensive  in  regard  to  other 
nations,  there  exists  a difference  in  morality  between  the  means  of  crypt- 


758

analysis  and  such  means  as  armies  and  navies.  The  latter  are  honest  and 
above-board,  open  deterrents  to  aggression ; they  are  like  strong  men  armed. 
Cryptanalysis  is  itself  an  aggression — often  a preventive  one,  to  be  sure — but 
still  an  aggression,  a trespass.  Moreover,  it  is  surreptitious,  snooping,  sneak- 
ing; it  makes  its  government  hypocritical.  It  is  the  very  opposite  of  all  that 
is  best  in  mankind.  It  shatters  the  highest  ethical  precept:  to  do  unto  others 
as  we  would  have  others  do  unto  us. 

Is  it,  then,  ever  morally  justified?  It  is.  A single  act  can  be  both  moral  and 
immoral,  depending  on  circumstances.  Killing  is  permissible  in  self-defense. 
So  is  cryptanalysis.  In  war,  of  course,  cryptanalysis  can  look  like  a positive 
good,  especially  when  it  saves  lives.  Even  in  peace,  cryptanalysis  may  be  a 
form  of  self-defense.  It  can  warn  of  hostile  intent  and  enable  the  government 
to  preserve  life  and  liberty,  without  which  there  is  no  doing  to  others  of  any 
kind.  But  when  a nation  is  not  threatened,  it  is  wrong  for  it  to  violate  another’s 
dignity  by  clandestine  pryings  into  its  messages,  just  as  it  is  wrong  to  indis- 
criminately tap  telephone  lines  or  invade  the  privacy  of  a man’s  castle.  That 
is  why  it  is  indefensible  for  the  United  States  to  read  the  messages  of  friendly 
nations  like  Norway,  Britain,  or  Peru. 

Even  when  justified,  cryptanalysis  remains  an  evil,  and  it  goes  against  the 
American  grain.  Ever  since  July  4,  1776,  the  United  States  has  stood  for 
morality  and  integrity,  in  international  affairs  as  in  domestic,  in  the  Fourteen 
Points  as  in  the  Emancipation  Proclamation.  It  is  this  stand  that,  in  large 
measure,  makes  America  great.  Cryptanalysis  therefore  poses  a much  greater 
problem  for  the  United  States  than  for  other  nations.  It  perhaps  reflects  this 
concern  that  the  United  States  places  her  national  cryptanalytic  agency  within 
the  Defense  Department,  where  it  belongs  in  ethical  terms,  while  Great  Britain 
puts  hers  in  the  Foreign  Office,  where  it  belongs  in  a practical  way. 

Only  once  has  cryptanalysis  been  treated  as  the  sin  against  morality  that  it 
is:  in  1929,  before  Hitler  and  the  Japanese  militarists,  with  no  nations  poten- 
tially dangerous  to  the  United  States  and  self-preservation  not  at  issue, 
Henry  L.  Stimson  closed  Yardley’s  Black  Chamber.  Even  though  it  was  done 
at  a time  when  the  United  States  could  afford  it,  the  decision  was  a profoundly 
moral  one,  and  it  marched  in  the  center  rank  of  American  belief.  Was  it  soft- 
headed, unrealistic?  No.  Idealism  is  the  ultimate  realism.  Ideas  of  truth  and 
justice  always  eventually  triumph.  Mankind  can  learn.  America’s  whole 
history  shows  this,  as  does  humanity’s  ascent  from  barbarism.  The  growth  of 
wisdom  and  morality — urged  on  in  these  present  times  by  the  very  real  danger 
of  total  annihilation — may  some  day  lead  mankind  to  beat  its  swords  into 
plowshares.  When  it  does,  it  will  no  longer  need  cryptanalysis,  and  will 
dismantle  organizations  like  N.S.A.  and  the  Spets-Otdel.  Their  nonexistence 
then  will  testify  to  a true  peace  on  earth.  And  may  such  be  their  glorious 
destiny!

Note  1 : Variations  in  Letter  Frequency 

The  problems  of  why  certain  letters  should  be  more  frequent  than  others  within 
a language,  and  why  one  language  should  prefer  sounds  that  another  abhors,  remain 
unsolved.  Why  should  e be  the  most  frequent  letter  in  English?  (This  question  is 
admittedly  complicated  in  English  by  the  discontinuity  between  speech  and  spelling, 
but  even  languages  whose  orthography  fits  their  phonetics  have  high-  and  low- 
frequency  letters.)  Why  should  o be  the  most  common  in  Russian,  a in  Serbo- 
Croatian,  and  e again  in  German,  French,  and  Spanish? 

Various  hypotheses  have  been  proposed ; none  is  entirely  satisfactory.  The  theory 
that  the  most  common  sounds  are  those  learned  earliest  in  babyhood  has  been 
proven  false.  The  suggestion  that  people  inhabiting  a cold,  damp  area  might  select 
a set  of  sounds  requiring  minimal  lip-opening  is  not  supported  by  the  facts.  Nor  is 
the  opposing  one  that  a community  of  fishermen  will  evolve  a language  rich  in 
vowels  to  better  communicate  over  great  distances  and  the  noises  of  the  sea.  The 
tendency  toward  economy  of  effort  explains  many  phenomena,  such  as  the  greater 
frequency  of  voiceless  stops  compared  with  voiced  stops,  but  founders  on  other 
facts,  such  as  the  development  in  some  languages  of  sounds  harder  to  pronounce 
than  those  they  are  replacing.  An  entire  book  has  discussed  the  correlation  between 
the  geographic  distribution  of  the  o-factor  in  blood  and  the  development  of  the 
/th/  sounds  in  Europe  to  demonstrate  that  hereditary  factors  predispose  populations 
to  certain  speech  sounds.  But,  as  a reviewer  has  pointed  out,  the  two  correspond 
“only  because  both  reflect  the  distribution,  movement  and  mixing  of  historic  people 
and  not  for  any  causal  relation”  between  genetics  and  phonetics.  Theories  that 
languages  tend  to  fill  holes  in  their  linguistic  patterns,  that  sounds  are  selected  on  the 
basis  of  auditory  or  articulatory  distinctiveness,  that  unusual  sounds  gain  in  popul- 
arity because  they  are  more  expressive  than  ordinary  ones,  that  the  culture  of  a com- 
munity (such  as  agricultural  versus  nomadic)  affects  its  sound  complement — each 
of  these  may  contain  a grain  of  truth  and  explain  certain  isolated  phenomena.  But 
no  one  thesis  provides  a single  explanation  of  why  one  language  evolves  one  set  of 
sounds  and  another  a different  set,  nor  explains  why  each  language  favors  certain 
sounds  over  others. 


Note  2:  Calculation  of  Redundancy 

Determining  the  percentage  of  redundancy  begins  with  the  calculation  of  a 
quantity  called  “entropy.”  Shannon  borrowed  this  term  from  physics  because  the 
form  of  the  equation  that  he  developed  for  the  amount  of  information  in  a set  of 
utterances  is  identical  with  that  used  in  physics  to  represent  entropy.  In  both  fields, 
entropy  measures  disorder,  randomness,  lack  of  structure.  The  greater  the  entropy, 
the  greater  the  chaos.  It  marks  a negative,  dispersive  tendency.  Entropy  is  of  great 
importance  in  physics  because  it  figures  in  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics, 
perhaps  the  sovereign  physical  principle.  This  states  that  “entropy  always  increases” 
— that  energy,  in  other  words,  always  passes  from  the  more  organized  state  to  the 
less  organized,  as,  for  example,  a star  dissipates  its  energy  in  radiation.  This  one- 
way flow  has  given  entropy  the  epithet  of  “time’s  arrow,”  because  an  increase  in

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


entropy  invariably  means  an  increase  in  the  age  of  an  (isolated)  physical  system.  If 
this  process  were  to  continue  to  its  end  within  the  universe,  Sir  James  Jeans  wrote, 
“there  would  be  neither  sunlight  nor  starlight,  but  only  a cool  glow  of  radiation 
uniformly  diffused  through  space.”  This  state  of  ultimate  maximum  entropy  has 
been  called  the  “heat-death  of  the  universe.” 

Since  an  increase  in  entropy  means  an  increase  in  anarchy,  the  language  with  the 
most  entropy  is  the  language  with  the  greatest  freedom.  This  is  obviously  a language 
with  no  rules  at  all  to  limit  it.  Such  a language  would  naturally  have  no  statistics  to 
govern  which  letters  would  be  used  most  often,  which  letters  would  be  likely  to 
follow  a given  letter,  and  so  on.  A text  can  be  written  in  such  a language  by  putting 
the  26  letters  and  the  space  (eliminating,  for  simplicity’s  sake,  signs  of  punctuation, 
capital  letters,  etc.)  into  an  urn,  drawing  one  item  out,  recording  it,  replacing  it, 
stirring  the  elements,  and  redrawing.  Chance  alone  controls,  and  the  text  would  be 
purely  random.  It  would  look  like  the  sample  Shannon  composed  by  just  such  a 
process :

The  Argentine  author  Jorge  Luis  Borges  has  written  a haunting  short  story  about 
an  imaginary  and  infinite  Library  of  Babel  whose  volumes  were  written  in  just  such 
a random  fashion.  It  therefore  contains  every  possible  combination  of  letters,  and, 
consequently,  “all  that  it  is  given  to  express  in  all  languages.  Everything:  the 
minutely  detailed  history  of  the  future,  the  archangels’  autobiographies,  the  faithful 
catalogue  of  the  Library,  thousands  and  thousands  of  false  catalogues,  the  demon- 
stration of  the  fallacy  of  those  catalogues,  the  demonstration  of  the  fallacy  of  the 
true  catalogues  ...  the  true  story  of  your  death,  the  translation  of  every  book  in  all 
languages.  ...  I cannot  combine  some  characters — dhcmrlchtdj — which  the  divine 
Library  has  not  foreseen.”  When  the  people  of  the  library  realized  that  it  was  total, 
they  rejoiced  because  they  knew  it  contained  the  answers  to  the  mysteries  of  the 
world.  Their  elation  was  followed  by  extreme  depression : they  could  not  find  the 
answers.  Thus  the  entropy  of  the  library  as  a whole  was  great  as  it  could  be.  The 
coherent  texts  were  as  much  the  result  of  chance  as  a line  of  poetry  accidentally 
tapped  out  by  those  typewriting  monkeys  of  Emile  Borel. 

But  natural  languages  are  not  random  affairs.  Their  many  rules  impart  a highly 
organized  structure  and  so  lower  their  entropy.  In  theory,  to  compute  the  entropy, 
one  must  1)  count  each  letter  in  the  universe  of  discourse,  figure  its  probability  of 
occurrence  by  dividing  into  the  total  number  of  letters,  multiply  this  probability  by 
its  logarithm  and  then  add  up  all  these  products,  changing  the  minus  signs  to  plus; 
2)  count  each  letter-pair,  figure  its  probability  of  occurrence,  multiply  the  probability 
by  its  logarithm,  total  the  products,  change  the  signs,  then  divide  by  two  (since 
entropy  is  specified  on  a per-letter  basis);  3)  count  each  trigram,  figure  its  probability, 
total  the  products  of  their  probabilities  and  the  logarithms  of  these  probabilities, 
change  signs,  and  divide  by  three;  4)  tally  all  the  four-letter  groups,  figure  the  prob- 
ability of  each,  multiply  their  probabilities  by  the  logarithms  of  their  probabilities, 
sum  the  products,  change  signs,  and  divide  by  four;  5)  repeat  this  process  with  ever- 
increasing  sizes  of  letter-groups  up  to  the  largest  utterances  that  can  give  a valid 
probability  of  occurrence.  Each  step  gives  a closer  approximation  to  the  entropy  of 
the  language  as  a whole.

The  Anatomy  of  Cryptology 

Shannon  has  actually  carried  out  the  first  three  steps  on  a sufficiently  large 
sample.  Using  a 27-item  alphabet  (including  the  word-space)  and  English  frequency 
tables,  he  found  that  the  entropy  for  single  letters  is  4.03  bits*  per  letter.  For  digraphs, 
it  falls  to  3.32  bits  per  letter,  and  for  trigrams  to  3.1  bits  per  letter.  The  decrease 
stems  from  the  fact  that  each  letter  influences  what  follows  it:  a t is  more  likely  to 
drag  an  h behind  it  than  an  /.  This  probability  constitutes  an  increase  in  order  and  a 
decrease  in  entropy. 

This  direct  technique  cannot  be  extended  very  far  in  practice,  because  the 
frequency  counts  rapidly  become  unwieldy.  By  the  time  1 2-letter  groups  are  reached, 
more  than  a billion  billion  frequency  pigeonholes  would  be  needed.  Consequently, 
Shannon  resorted  to  indirect  methods,  which  draw  upon  the  fact  that  “anyone 
speaking  a language  possesses,  implicitly,  an  enormous  knowledge  of  the  statistics 
of  the  language.”  Mathematics  can  extract  the  entropy  from  these  results.  In  one 
experiment,  Shannon  counted  how  many  guesses  a subject  needed  to  determine  the 
right  letter  in  an  unknown  text.  The  number  beneath  the  letter  gives  the  number  of 
guesses  one  subject  made :

Of  the  102  symbols,  the  subject  guessed  right  on  the  first  try  79  times  and  required 
three  or  more  guesses  only  1 5 times.  Most  of  these  occur  where  the  line  of  thought  has 
more  possibilities  of  branching  out. 

In  another  experiment,  subjects  tried  to  complete  a phrase  from  which  the  spaces 
and  the  vowels  had  been  deleted,  yielding  a text  half  as  long  as  the  original : 

FCTSSTRNGRTHNFCTN 

Six  subjects  restored  an  average  of  93  per  cent  of  the  deletions,  and  several  recon- 
structed the  full  text : Fact  is  stranger  than  fiction. 

On  the  basis  of  tests  like  this,  Shannon  estimated  that  the  entropy  of  English  in 
100-letter  groups  stands  at  about  1 bit  per  letter.  It  is  this  low  because  the  cumula- 
tive effect  of  the  long  preceding  passage  quite  substantially  constrains  the  last  letter. 

* “Bits”  is  a blend-word  for  “binary  digits.”  Binary  digits  are  the  two  figures  in  a 
system  of  numerical  notation  that  uses  only  two  different  numbers  to  express  quantities,  the 
two  digits  are  commonly  0 and  1.  Ordinary  notation  uses  decimal  digits  in  its  ten-number 
system.  To  count  in  bits,  one  goes  through  the  same  procedure  with  two  numbers  that  one 
goes  through  in  decimal  digits  with  ten.  Thus  the  quantities  which  in  decimal  notation  are  0, 
1,2,  3, 4,  5, 6,  7, 8,  9,  10,  1 1,  are  in  binary  notation  0,  1,  10,  11,  100,  101,  110,  111,  1000,  1001, 
1010,  1011.  Binary  digits  express  results  in  terms  of  a choice  of  one  of  two  exclusive  possibili- 
ties, in  terms  of  this  or  that,  on  or  off,  all  or  nothing,  1 or  0.  Thus  4.03  bits  per  letter  simply 
means  that  4.03  yes-no  choices  must  be  made  to  determine  the  right  letter.  This  form  has  a 
variety  of  conceptual  advantages  in  information  theory  over  the  10  alternatives  presented  by 
decimal  digits.  The  binary  is  just  another  form  of  numerical  notation,  like  the  octal  system 
used  in  computers  and  the  duodecimal  system  sometimes  urged  for  daily  life  because  12  has 
more  divisors  than  10.  The  binary  system  requires  the  use  of  logarithms  to  the  base  2 instead 
of  to  the  base  10  in  calculations. 


762 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Actually,  other  tests  indicate  that  entropy  ceases  to  decline  after  about  32  letters  are 
taken  as  a group.  In  other  words,  32  letters  exert  virtually  the  same  influence  over 
those  that  follow  them  as  100  do. 

Naturally,  no  such  cohesion  exists  in  the  “urn  language,”  or  that  of  the  Library 
of  Babel,  where  letters  were  generated  independently.  Nor  are  there  any  frequency 
variations,  because  chance  will  select  all  equally  often.  This  “urn  language,”  whose 
entropy  is  strictly  a function  of  the  number  of  elements  in  its  alphabet,  becomes  the 
standard  against  which  natural  languages  are  measured.  The  result  of  the  compari- 
son is  redundancy.  Technically  speaking,  redundancy  is  the  ratio  of  the  entropy  of  a 
language  to  the  maximum  value  entropy  can  have  with  the  same  number  of  elements, 
subtracted  from  1.  It  is  expressed  as  a percentage.  The  maximum  entropy  of  an 
alphabet  of  27  items  is  the  logarithm  of  27,  or  4.76  bits  per  letter,  of  26  items,  4.70. 
With  English’s  entropy  of  I bit  per  letter,  this  gives  a redundancy  for  English  of 
1 — 1/4.7,  or  79  per  cent,  which  is  usually  reduced  to  the  simpler  and  more  conserva- 
tive 75  per  cent.

HETEROGENEOUS  IMPULSES 


few  false  ideas  have  more  firmly  gripped  the  minds  of  so  many  intelligent 
men  than  the  one  that,  if  they  just  tried,  they  could  invent  a cipher  that  no  one 
could  break.  Many  have  tried  and,  although  only  a fraction  of  their  ciphers 
have  been  published  or  patented,  the  quantity  and  variety  of  even  this  small 
sample  is  astounding. 

Emile  Myzskowski,  a retired  French  colonel,  devised  a kind  of  repeated- 
key  transposition  and  published  it  in  his  Cryptographie  indechiffrable. 
Collon,  a Belgian  Army  officer,  proposed  a number  of  fractionating  systems. 
One  Rozier  marched  his  plaintext  letters  through  the  interior  of  a Vigenere 
tableau  in  a dizzily  twisting  path  in  an  attempt  to  lose  the  cryptanalyst.  The 
so-called  Phillips  cipher  enciphers  five  letters  mon  alphabetically  in  a 5 x 5 
square,  then  shifts  the  lines  of  the  square  and  repeats  the  process.  The  Amsco 
transposition  cipher  accepts  both  single  letters  and  pairs  as  its  plaintext 
elements.  A.  de  Grandpre  filled  a 10x10  square  with  ten  10-letter  words 
whose  first  letters  form  a mnemonic  acrostic,  then  ranged  coordinates  on  the 
outside  and  used  these  to  encipher;  the  use  of  plaintext  words  inside  provides 
homophones  in  approximately  the  proportion  required  to  disguise  the  fre- 
quencies of  normal  plaintext.  A French  major,  Louis-Marie-Jules  Schneider, 
concocted  an  enormously  complex  polyalphabetic  whose  alphabets  were 
generated  one  from  the  other;  this  was  one  of  the  systems  William  F.  Fried- 
man broke  in  evolving  the  principle  of  the  index  of  coincidence.  A mathe- 
matician named  Arthur  Porges  devised  a system  based  upon  a continuing 
fraction.  The  Nicodemus  cipher  sets  out  a plaintext  beneath  a keyword, 
enciphers  it  in  Vigenere  according  to  that  keyword,  and  then  transposes  it 
vertically  by  keynumbers  derived  from  the  keyword.  The  Count  de  Mirabeau, 
an  18th-century  French  revolutionist,  enciphered  in  a Polybius  square  whose 
sets  of  coordinates  both  ran  from  1 to  5;  he  wrote  each  two-digit  equivalent 
vertically  and  then  transcribed  all  of  the  first  digits  and  then  all  of  the  second, 
inserting  numbers  from  6 to  0 at  will  as  nulls.  Some  amateurs  just  propose 
enciphering  a message  in  Vigenere  and  superenciphering  the  text  in  Playfair. 
There  have  been  autokey  transpositions  and  a cipher  invented  by  W.  B. 
Homan  that  produces  a cryptogram  in  which  every  letter  of  the  alphabet 
occurs  as  often  as  every  other.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Beyond  these  pencil-and-paper  systems,  the  files  of  the  patent  offices  bulge 
with  quantities  of  cipher  disks — probably  the  most  popular  single  kind  of 
cipher  invention — and  with  gear  arrangements,  grilles,  cylinders,  mechanized 
tableaux,  strip  systems,  and  so  on.  (Most  of  these  mechanisms  produce 
substitution  ciphers  because  of  a very  basic  difference  between  substitution 
and  transposition.  A transposition  cipher  resembles  what  industrial  engineers 
call  a “batch”  manufacturing  process,  in  which  quantities  of  material  are 
cooked  at  a time,  the  product  issuing  in  batches.  This  is  because  a trans- 
position requires  a whole  group  of  letters  that  will  all  be  mixed  together,  and  it 
is  hard  for  a mechanical  device  to  store  letters.  A substitution  cipher,  on  the 
other  hand,  is  like  a “continuous”  process.  Here  the  raw  materials — letters  in 
one  case,  ingredients  in  the  other — flow  continually,  are  not  stored,  and  may 
be  cut  off  at  any  point.) 

Probably  most  ciphers  get  invented  as  a bit  of  recreation,  as  a part  of  the 
spell  of  interest  in  cryptology  that  so  many  people  seem  to  go  through.  Sooner 
or  later  it  occurs  to  every  cryptologist  that  an  acquaintance  will  say,  “It  can’t 
be  too  hard  to  make  a cipher  that  can’t  be  solved.”  The  friend  then  offers  his 
theories,  which  often  involve  some  crude  sort  of  polyalphabeticity  or  a book 
code.  Frequently  he  dredges  up  some  system  from  his  adolescence  and,  taking 
half  an  hour  to  put  a ten-word  message  into  that  cipher,  challenges  the  crypto- 
logist to  break  it  on  the  spot.  William  Jerdan,  a 19th-century  British  journalist, 
told  in  his  autobiography  a very  typical  story  of  the  birth  of  a cipher,  report- 
ing with  a refreshing  touch  of  humor  on  the  dreams  of  glory  that  often 
accompany  the  nativity. 

One  evening,  while  Jerdan  and  his  young  friends  were  talking,  the  subject 
of  ciphers  came  up.  Jerdan  boasted  that  “I  myself  could  frame  a system  which 
nobody  on  earth  could  decypher  and  read”  and  bet  a dinner  on  it.  Then  some- 
body pulled  down  an  encyclopedia  to  show  him  the  many  systems  that  had 
been  invented,  and,  said  Jerdan,  “when  I retired  to  rest  [1]  was  on  no  very 
pleasant  terms  with  myself,  for  I had  looked  very  like  what  I had  no  chance 
of  inventing — a Cypher.”  But  in  the  morning  he  awoke  “with  a secret  cypher 
concocted  in  my  brain,”  which  he  discussed  with  his  friends,  among  them 
Thomas  Wilde,  a future  Lord  Chancellor.  They  agreed  that  “It  ought  to  be 
laid  before  the  government,  and  I cannot  tell  how  immense  a reward  I was  to 
reap  for  my  wonderful  discovery.  No  castle  in  the  air  was  ever  more  stupen- 
dous and  gorgeous  than  mine.  . . . Wilde  and  I were  now  all  agog  for  an 
audience  of  the  Prime  Minister,  to  put  him  in  possession  of  the  good  fortune 
which  had  befallen  his  government,  and  ourselves  in  the  way  of  wealth  and 
promotion.”  They  did  manage  to  describe  the  cipher  to  a government  secre- 
tary, and  many  years  later,  Jerdan,  visiting  a high  Foreign  Office  official,  saw 
a cipher  being  used  based  on  his  principle.  He  naturally  thought  that  it  was 
his,  but  it  may  have  been  invented  independently  by  someone  else. 

Nearly  every  inventor  of  a cipher  system  has  been  convinced  of  the  un- 
solvability of  his  brainchild.  (The  tendency  to  claim  this  in  patents  has, 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  765 

however,  been  receding  with  the  rise  of  cryptologic  sophistication.)  In  1744, 
Leonhard  Euler,  the  great  Swiss  mathematician,  sent  to  a friend  a mon- 
alphabetic  substitution  cryptogram  that  had  a few  homophones,  expressing 
his  belief  that  it  could  not  be  deciphered.  He  was  only  slightly  more  naive 
than  most  inventors.  A representative  of  the  humanities,  Walter  W.  Skeat,  a 
distinguished  English  philologist  and  editor  of  Chaucer,  proposed  a cipher  in 
1896  that  amounted  to  a Vigenere  with  key  ABCDE;  when  hordes  of  amateur 
cryptanalysts  knocked  it  off,  he  had  the  grace  to  bow  and  retire.  Nearly  all  the 
cryptographic  fossils  entombed  in  dusty  books  or  in  old  files  of  patent  offices 
deserve  their  oblivion.  They  are  too  prone  to  error  or  too  easy  to  solve  or  too 
cumbersome.  Many  an  inventor  delights  in  intricacy.  Poorly  endowed  with 
empathy,  he  never  considers  the  possibility  that  cipher  clerks  will  not  dote  as 
lovingly  upon  the  complex  calculations  of  his  cipher  as  he  does ; he  fails  to 
realize  that  to  the  clerks  ciphering  is  not  a pleasant  after-hours  recreation  but 
a day-long,  dull,  boring  job,  about  as  exciting  as  adding  up  columns  of 
figures,  and  that  they  would  rather  be  out  on  a date  with  a girl  friend. 

Charles  Babbage  asserted  that  no  man’s  cipher  was  worth  looking  at  unless 
the  inventor  had  himself  solved  a very  difficult  cipher.  This  rule  holds  true  in 
the  great  majority  of  cases  and  if  observed  would  have  saved  cryptologists  a 
great  deal  of  time.  But  it  would  be  like  having  required  Thomas  Edison  to 
pass  a stiff  examination  in  acoustical  theory  before  deigning  to  look  at  his 
phonograph.  The  Babbage  rule  would  have  deprived  cryptologists  of  some 
of  the  most  important  features  of  modern  cryptography,  such  as  the  Vernam 
mechanism,  the  rotor,  the  Hagelin  machine.  Cryptologists  must  process  a lot 
of  ore  to  get  something  valuable — but  so  must  diamond  miners. 

In  evaluating  their  ciphers,  many  inventors  err  by  thinking  that  the 
cryptanalyst  must  retrace  the  decipherment  steps  in  his  solution  and  that, 
since  some  of  these  steps  are  recoverable  only  with  the  key,  the  cipher  must 
remain  inviolate.  For  example,  a simple  cipher  decomposes  the  plaintext  into 
the  coordinates  of  a checkerboard,  regroups  these  by  uniting  the  second  co- 
ordinate of  each  letter  with  the  first  coordinate  of  the  next  letter  (combining 


the  leftover  coordinates  of  the  first  and  last  letters),  and  recomposes  them  as

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


To  the  inventor,  it  appears  that  because  the  cryptanalyst  does  not  know  the 
coordinates  of  the  letters,  which  are  necessary  to  reconstruct  the  intermediate 
numerical  text — which  in  turn  seems  essential  to  the  recovery  of  the  plaintext 
— he  cannot  make  an  entry  into  the  cryptogram.  A smooth  unbroken  surface, 
upon  which  the  cryptanalyst  can  find  no  purchase,  apparently  protects  the 
cipher.  But  the  cryptanalyst  does  not  think  like  that.  Analyzing  the  structure 
and  not  the  operation  of  the  cipher,  he  observes  that  the  second,  or  column, 
coordinate  of  the  ciphertext  letter  k is  the  first,  or  row,  coordinate  of  the 
unknown  plaintext  letter,  and  that  the  first,  or  row,  coordinate  of  the  next 
ciphertext  letter,  b,  forms  the  second,  or  column,  coordinate  of  that  same 
plaintext  letter.  This  observation  circumvents  any  need  to  find  the  actual 
numerical  coordinates,  and  from  there  the  cryptanalyst  can  proceed  with  his 
solution. 

Many  inventors  also  invoke  the  vast  number  of  combinations  of  keys 
afforded  by  their  system  as  proof  of  its  invulnerability.  To  exhaust  the  possible 
solutions  would  take  eons,  they  contend,  unwittingly  using  the  same  argument 
to  defend  their  systems  as  Cardano  used  to  defend  a mon  alphabetic — and 
with  the  same  lack  of  validity.  For,  as  Shannon  has  shown,  the  cryptanalyst 
does  not  go  after  these  possibilities  one  by  one.  He  eliminates  millions  at  a 
time.  Moreover,  the  trials  progress  from  the  more  probable  to  the  less  prob- 
able hypotheses,  increasing  the  cryptanalyst’s  chance  of  striking  the  right  one 
early.  “Whereas  complete  trial  and  error  requires  trials  to  the  order  of  the 
number  of  keys,”  Shannon  wrote,  “this  subdividing  trial  and  error  requires 
only  trials  to  the  order  of  the  key  size  in  bits,”  a very  much  smaller  number. 

Such  observations  seldom  have  much  effect  upon  a determined  inventor. 
If  a cryptologist  points  out  a chink  in  the  cryptologic  armor,  the  inventor 
patches  it  with  an  extra  complication.  The  less  the  inventor  knows  about 
cryptology,  the  more  stubbornly  will  he  cling  to  his  conviction  of  unbreak- 
ability;  and  the  more  intelligent  he  is,  the  more  ingeniously  will  he  palter  with 
the  cryptologist.  If  the  cryptologist  objects  that  the  cipher  will  not  stand  up 
to  heavy  traffic  or  will  engender  too  many  bad  errors,  the  inventor  replies 
that  the  cipher  must  be  used  properly  for  it  to  remain  unbreakable.  By 
“properly”  he  means  the  conditions  that  obtain  only  in  cryptography’s 
Utopia — no  enciphering  or  transmission  errors,  no  traffic  volume  exceeding 
the  prescribed  bounds  for  a particular  key. 

But  this  at  once  reduces  his  cipher  to  triviality  as  a practical  method  of 
cryptography.  For  with  such  a definition  of  “properly”  any  cipher  may  be 
regarded  as  unbreakable.  Even  a monalphabetic  substitution  would  be  used 
properly,  in  this  sense,  if  only  a single,  very  short  cryptogram  were  sent  in  it. 
The  inventor,  concentrating  on  those  rare  occasions  on  which  his  cipher  would 
be  used  properly,  refuses  to  see  the  vast  domain  in  which  it  will  not  serve. 
But  the  ratio  of  the  area  in  which  a cipher  will  serve  to  the  area  in  which  it  will 
not  counts  as  much  in  evaluating  it  as  its  intrinsic  merits.  The  cryptologist  of 
course  sees  this,  but  when  he  attempts  to  direct  the  inventor’s  gaze  to  this 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  767 

outside  world  the  inventor  tells  him,  “I  am  not  talking  about  that.”  The 
cryptologist  and  the  inventor  are  indeed  talking  about  two  different  things, 
and  each  in  his  way  is  right.  The  inventor  is  right  when  he  says  that  the  cipher 
is  impregnable  within  its  tiny  duchy.  But  the  cryptologist  is  even  more 
right  when  he  says  that  it  is  insignificant. 

Classic  in  the  annals  of  cryptographic  invention  is  the  case  history  of  J.  F. 
Byrne,  who  stuck  with  his  cipher  through  repeated  rebuffs  for  more  than  35 
years.  Byrne  was  an  intimate  of  James  Joyce;  they  were  students  together  at 
Dublin,  and  Joyce  modeled  Cranly  in  his  Portrait  of  the  Artist  as  a Young 
Man  upon  Byrne,  and  made  Byrne’s  residence,  7 Eccles  Street,  Dublin,  the 
home  of  Leopold  and  Mollie  Bloom,  the  two  protagonists  of  his  great  Ulysses* 
It  was  in  1918  that  Byrne  hit  upon  the  principle  of  what  he  later  called  his 
“Chaocipher,”  which  he  never  disclosed  publicly.  It  required  nothing  more 
than  a cigar  box  and  a few  bits  of  string  and  odds  and  ends  for  its  operation. 
When  he  showed  it  to  his  sister,  she  exclaimed  that  it  would  bring  him  a Nobel 
Prize — not  for  science,  apparently,  but  for  ushering  in  an  age  of  universal 
peace  by  conferring  the  gift  of  perfect  security  upon  the  communications  of 
all  nations  and  all  men.  Wrote  Byrne: 

When  I first  set  out  to  discover  a system  for  concocting  an  indecipherable 
cipher,  I had  it  clearly  in  mind  that  such  a system  would  and  should  be  univer- 
sally available.  I envisioned,  for  instance,  the  utilization  of  my  method  and 
machine  by  business  men  for  business  communications,  and  by  brotherhoods 
and  social  and  religious  institutions.  I believe  that  my  method  and  machine 
would  be  an  invaluable  asset  to  big  religious  institutions,  as  for  example  the 
Catholic  Church  with  its  world-wide  ramifications.  I had,  and  still  have  in  mind 


* It  may  not  be  coincidence  that  in  Ulysses  an  inventory  of  Mr.  Leopold  Bloom’s  locked 
private  drawer  at  7 Eccles  Street  included,  among  other  things,  “3  typewritten  letters, 
addressee,  Henry  Flower,  c/o  P.O.  Westland  Row,  addresser,  Martha  Clifford,  c/o  P.O. 
Dolphin’s  Barn : the  transliterated  name  and  address  of  the  addresser  of  the  3 letters  in 
reversed  alphabetic  boustrephodontic  punctuated  quadrilinear  cryptogram  (vowels  sup- 
pressed) n.igs./wi.uu.ox/w.oks.mh/y.im  : . . . .”  “Quadrilinear”  meant  to  set  the  cipher  in 
four  lines;  “reversed  alphabetic”  indicated  the  key  of  a = z,  b = y,  etc.;  “boustrepho- 
dontic,” an  adjective  concocted  from  the  adjective  “boustrephodon,”  a technical  term  in 
paleography  referring  to  writing  that  runs  left  and  right  in  alternate  lines,  indicating  that  the 
lines  of  the  cryptogram  were  to  be  read  in  that  way.  Unfortunately,  Joyce  or  Bloom  forgot 
about  this  in  the  fourth  line,  which  incorrectly  reads  left  to  right.  The  cryptogram  and  its 
solution  thus  are:

the  universal  use  of  my  machine  and  method  by  husband,  wife,  or  lover.  My 
machine  would  be  on  hire,  as  typewriter  machines  now  are,  in  hotels,  steamships, 
and,  maybe  even  on  trains  and  airliners,  available  for  anyone  anywhere  and  at 
any  time.  And  I believe,  too,  that  the  time  will  come — and  come  soon — when  my 
system  will  be  used  in  the  publication  of  pamphlets  and  books  written  in  cipher 
which  will  be  unreadable  except  by  those  who  are  specially  initiated. 

Byrne  corresponded  with  Colonel  Parker  Hitt,  and  in  1922  demonstrated 
his  machine  before  Friedman  and  Colonel  Frank  Moorman,  former  head  of 
g.2  a.6,  then  handling  cryptography  for  the  Signal  Corps.  They  did  not  want 
it.  He  offered  it  to  the  State  Department,  which  replied  with  a form  letter 
stating  that  its  “ciphers  are  adequate  to  its  needs” — a statement  that  Byrne 
rightly  damned  as  “a  paragon  of  smugness.”  He  submitted  it  to  the  Navy  in 
1937-38,  negotiating  apparently  with  Commander  Joseph  N.  Wenger,  and  to 
A.  T.  & T.’s  Ralzemond  D.  Parker,  chief  of  company  development  and 
research  and  Vernam’s  boss  when  he  invented  the  on-line  mechanism.  Nobody 
took  it. 

Byrne’s  faith  remained  undaunted.  He  had  a little  brochure  printed  in 
which  he  enciphered  known  texts  in  his  Chaocipher  and  defied  the  world  to 
break  it.  Toward  the  close  of  his  life,  he  wrote  a book  of  reminiscences.  It 
told  much  about  his  days  with  Joyce,  but  his  real  reason  for  writing  it  was  not 
to  shed  light  on  early  Joyce  but  to  get  his  Chaocipher  before  a larger  audience. 
The  21st  and  last  chapter  of  Silent  Years:  An  Autobiography  with  Memoirs  of 
James  Joyce  and  Our  Ireland , comprising  fully  one  eighth  of  the  book,  re- 
capitulated the  story  of  his  Chaocipher.  Byrne  concluded  by  betting  $5,000 
or  the  total  royalties  of  the  first  three  months  after  publication  of  his  book 
that  no  one  would  be  able  to  solve  the  message  in  Chaocipher  that  he  printed 
in  extenso  in  the  final  pages.  He  flung  the  challenge  also  at  the  amateurs  of 
the  American  Cryptogram  Association  and  the  New  York  Cipher  Society 
and  at  Norbert  Wiener,  father  of  cybernetics,  and  to  other  believers  in  the 
capabilities  of  the  electronic  calculating  machines. 

Nobody  ever  claimed  the  money,  and  Byrne  died  a few  years  later.  One 
may  presume  that  the  reason  both  for  the  failure  of  the  public  to  read  his 
cipher  and  the  failure  of  the  government  to  adopt  it  was  that  while  the  cipher 
probably  had  many  merits,  its  many  demerits  outweighed  them  for  practical 
use.  Byrne,  like  many  inventors,  both  won  and  lost.  His  cipher  was  never 
broken.  But  his  dream  never  came  true. 

Codemaking  appears  to  be  such  a popular  sport  because  it  is  literally 
fancy-free.  If  cryptography  is  a form  of  abstract  algebra,  then  inventing  a new 
cipher  system  is  nothing  more  than  building  abstract  castles  in  the  air  with 
material  and  design  of  one’s  own  choosing.  To  make  the  system  work  is 
little  more  than  to  avoid  self-contradiction,  yet  when  the  answer  comes  out 
right  it  always  satisfies  the  inventor.  Codemaking  is  much  more  popular  than 
codebreaking  because  it  is  easier  and  more  esthetic;  it  flings  together  shining 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  ^69 

theories  however  it  pleases,  whereas  cryptanalysis  forces  the  mind  to  concen- 
trate upon  the  data,  upon  the  coarse  rubble  of  reality.  But  cryptanalysis  is 
much  more  rewarding.  For  it  subdues  these  hard  and  unyielding  facts,  it 
represents  a victory  of  the  mind  over  something,  whereas  codemaking 
represents  a triumph  over  nothing.  This  mental  mastery  is  the  keen  pleasure- 
pang  of  solution ; it  is  what  men  of  the  intellectual  caliber  of  Babbage  and 
Wheatstone  see  in  cryptanalysis,  and  it  explains  the  most  extraordinary 
testimonial  ever  given  to  cryptanalysis.  The  testimonial’s  phraseology  is 
undistinguished  and  the  cryptogram  was  elementary ; what  gives  it  its  weight 
is  that  it  was  uttered  by  Harry  Houdini.  “I  managed,  after  some  worry,  to 
solve  the  message,  and  very  few  things  in  after  life  gave  me  as  much  pleasure 
as  did  the  unraveling  of  that  code,”  wrote  the  man  who,  one  would  think, 
would  say  that  about  his  ability  to  untangle  the  physical  puzzles  of  knotted 
ropes  and  straitjackets  and  of  locks  on  trunks  thrown  into  the  water  to  which 
he  daily  owed  his  life. 

Consequently  it  is  not  surprising  to  learn  that  those  addicted  to  this 
mental  enjoyment  have  banded  together  to  assure  themselves  of  it.  The  Ameri- 
can Cryptogram  Association  was  founded  in  1932  by  members  of  the  National 
Puzzlers  League  who  wanted  to  concentrate  more  on  cryptology,  taking  as 
their  motto  “The  cryptogram  is  the  aristocrat  of  puzzles.”  Today  the  A.C.A. 
numbers  about  500  members,  including  some  from  Japan,  Australia,  New 
Zealand,  India,  Israel,  Algeria,  England,  Netherlands,  Spain,  Northern 
Ireland,  Germany,  Sweden,  Argentina,  Venezuela,  and  Canada.  Their  pro- 
fessions are  varied ; included  are  lawyers,  editors,  physicians,  professors,  civil 
servants,  teachers,  housewives,  widows,  engineers,  mathematicians,  computer 
programmers,  a puzzle  maker,  and  retired  people.  Most  of  the  members  affect 
a nom  de  plume,  or  sort  of  sprightly  codename,  like  b.  natural,  ab  struse, 
frinkus,  dr.  cryptogram;  this  is  a carry-over  from  the  National  Puzzlers 
League  and  is  alleged  to  increase  informality  among  the  membership.  Every 
other  month,  the  association  publishes  The  Cryptogram,  a magazine  usually 
of  24  pages  with  articles  on  cryptanalysis,  new  ciphers,  and  cryptologic 
history.  It  offers  the  members  several  kinds  of  cryptograms  for  solution— 
monalphabetics  with  word  divisions  ranging  from  the  simplest  to  the  kind 
with  the  most  twisted  syntax  and  vocabulary  (these  are  called  "Aristocrats” 
in  recognition  of  the  association’s  motto),  monalphabetics  without  word 
divisions  (“Patristocrats”),  cryptograms  in  all  the  varieties  of  cipher  that  can 
be  solved  within  the  compass  of  a 150-letter  message,  sometimes  with  tips, 
and  cryptograms  in  foreign  languages,  including  occasionally  Esperanto, 
Latin,  and  Hungarian.  Solvers’  noms  and  scores  are  listed.  The  association 
holds  an  annual  convention  at  which  members  hear  talks  on  cryptology, 
engage  in  a cipher  contest,  are  interviewed  by  slightly  befuddled  newspaper- 
men, and  banquet.  In  the  larger  cities,  members  have  banded  together  to  form 
local’  groups,  such  as  the  New  York  Cipher  Society,  which  usually  meet 
monthly  to  talk,  exchange  ideas,  and  socialize.  The  association  appears  to  be

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  only  one  of  its  kind  in  the  world,  though  France  has  an  Amicale  des 
Reservistes  du  Chiffre,  a quasi-official  organization  of  Army,  Navy,  and  Air 
reservists  and  active  officers  in  cryptology. 

Tens  of  thousands  of  people  not  in  the  A.C.A.  get  the  thrill  of  cryptan- 
alysis by  solving  the  monalphabetic  substitutions  printed  in  daily  newspapers 
as  puzzles  much  like  the  crossword  puzzle.  Some  of  these  are  relatively  simple, 
using  ordinary  words  in  a quotation  from  a famous  author,  while  other  news- 
papers print  short,  rather  tough  cryptograms  made  of  rare  and  almost  non- 
sensical words.  Most  of  these  cryptograms  are  syndicated.  In  addition,  cross- 
word puzzle  magazines  usually  include  a few  monalphabetics.  One  magazine, 
which  paid  a dollar  apiece  for  the  cryptograms,  got  most  of  its  supply  from 
an  inmate  of  an  Ohio  prison. 

While  many  people  make  and  break  ciphers  in  sport,  others  do  it  in  earnest. 
The  variety  and  quantity  of  nonpolitical  cryptography  can  only  equal  the 
number  of  motives  that  impel  people  to  secrecy,  and  these  motives,  like  their 
ciphers,  are  most  heterogeneous. 

In  the  graveyard  of  New  York’s  Trinity  Church,  on  Broadway  at  the  foot 
of  Wall  Street  in  the  very  heart  of  the  financial  district,  stands  a tombstone 
with  an  epitaph  partly  in  cipher.  Under  it  lies  James  Leeson,  who  died  Sep- 
tember 28,  1794,  aged  38.  The  cipher  inscription  is  in  the  ancient  pigpen 
cipher,  whose  use  goes  back  hundreds  of  years,  and  it  reads  Remember  Death. 
Why  Leeson  had  it  carved  there  no  one,  perhaps,  will  ever  know,  but  his 
motive  may  well  have  been  that  of  the  ancient  Egyptians  who  first  used 
cryptography  in  their  sepulchral  inscriptions:  to  stay  passersby  and  bring  the 
dead  to  life  in  their  memory. 

More  obscure  are  the  motives  that  led  several  people  to  encipher  entries  in 
church  registers,  though  the  conjectures  can  be  tantalizing.  At  Cleator, 
Cumberland,  England,  someone  used  the  very  simple  cipher 

a e i o u 1 m n r 
123456789 

with  the  rest  of  the  plaintext  letters  left  unenciphered  to  record  in  Latin  the 
baptism  on  January  1,  1645,  of  Janet  Barne,  daughter  of  William  Barne, 
curate  of  the  parish.  The  mother’s  name  is  not  given.  Could  the  encipherer 
have  been  Barne  himself?  And  if  so,  was  he  perhaps  hiding  an  illegitimate 
birth?  The  same  system  was  used  in  the  fee-book  for  the  parish  of  Iver  near 
Uxbridge,  England,  to  note  on  January  17,  1767,  the  marriage  of  188  b58y48. 
Why  Ann  Bunyon’s  name  should  be  veiled  while  her  husband’s  was  left  in 
clear  remains  unknown. 

In  two  spirals  on  a minute  of  a letter  of  September  14,  1750,  Gabriel 
Cramer,  a teacher  of  mathematics  at  the  Calvin  Academy  in  Geneva,  who 
corresponded  with  the  most  learned  men  of  his  time,  inscribed  two  cipher 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  771 

messages.  Simple  columnar  transpositions,  they  counseled.  The  oracle  tells 
thee  to  fear  nothing;  thou  art  permitted  to  hope  for  everything;  dare  boldly; 
banish  fear;  thou  canst  surely  give  thyself  over  to  joy.”  Cramer  almost 
certainly  composed  the  messages  only  for  his  own  pleasure  or  encouragement, 
perhaps  choosing  the  spiral  because  it  symbolized  unrolling  time  and  so  a 
future  to  which  he  may  have  looked  forward. 

The  location  of  a hidden  treasure  remains  concealed  beneath  a crypto- 
gram that  has  resisted  the  digging  of  cryptanalytic  treasure  hunters  for  more 
than  a century.  The  story  begins  in  1817,  when  one  Thomas  Jefferson  Beale 
and  his  company  of  30  men  were  following  an  immense  herd  of  buffalo  about 
250  miles  north  of  Santa  Fe.  They  camped  for  the  night  in  a small  ravine,  and 
in  the  firelight  something  sparkled  in  the  rocks:  gold!  For  18  months,  Beale 
and  the  others  mined  quantities  of  both  gold  and  silver.  He  and  ten  com- 
panions returned  to  Virginia  in  November,  1819,  to  hide  half  a ton  of  gold 
and  almost  two  tons  of  silver  in  an  excavation  six  feet  deep  “in  the  county  of 
Bedford  about  four  miles  from  Bufords.”  Two  years  later  he  deposited  almost 
a ton  of  gold,  half  a ton  of  silver,  and  $13,000  worth  of  jewels.  Beale  then  left 
again  for  the  West.  He  never  returned.  But  he  had  left  a locked  box  with 
Robert  Morris,  a tavern  keeper  for  whose  integrity  he  had  great  respect, 
asking  Morris  to  wait  ten  years  and  then,  if  Beale  had  not  returned,  to 
open  it. 

Morris  waited  more  than  twenty  years  before  breaking  the  lock.  Inside  he 
found  several  sheets  of  paper  covered  with  numbers  and  two  letters  addressed 
to  him.  They  told  the  story  of  the  discovery  of  the  gold  and  directed  him  to 
divide  the  treasure  into  31  equal  parts — one  part  for  himself  and  one  to  be 
given  to  the  next  of  kin  of  each  of  the  30  men.  The  cryptograms  gave  the 
names  of  the  next  of  kin  and  the  location  of  the  treasure.  The  letters  promised 
that  their  key  would  be  sent  to  Morris,  but  none  had  ever  arrived. 

Morris  set  about  trying  to  solve  the  cryptograms.  He  got  nowhere.  After 
a number  of  years  of  failure,  he  shared  the  secret  with  James  B.  Ward,  of 
Campbell  County,  Virginia,  who  also  strove  to  read  the  messages.  Ward 
eventually  succeeded  in  breaking  the  cipher  of  the  paper  marked  No.  2,  which 
specified  the  amount  of  the  treasure  and  how  and  when  Beale  had  buried  it. 
But  it  did  not  say  where.  The  message  ended:  Paper  Number  One  describes  the 
exact  locality  of  the  vault,  so  that  no  difficulty  will  be  had  in  finding  it. 

The  key  to  Paper  No.  2 lay  in  the  Declaration  of  Independence.  Beale  had 
numbered  each  word  from  1 to  1322  and  had  used  the  word  s number  as  the 
cipher  equivalent  for  the  first  letter  ot  the  word.  But  the  Declaration  of 
Independence  did  not  unlock  the  desperately  sought  cryptogram  of  Paper 
No.  1 . This  is  a numerical  message  of  496  groups  ranging  from  1 to  2906, 
with  a moderate  quantity  of  repeats.  Cryptanalysts  or  more  accurately, 
would-be  cryptanalysts — have  attacked  it  repeatedly,  trying  the  Constitution, 
books  of  the  Bible,  plays  of  Shakespeare.  Nothing  has  worked.  A copy  was 
sent  to  Fabyan’s  Riverbank  Laboratories,  but  no  solution  came  back.  In

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


1964,  Dr.  Carl  Hammer,  of  Washington,  D.C.,  ran  elaborate  statistical  tests 
on  an  electronic  computer,  the  Univac  1107,  to  determine  the  cryptogram’s 
properties.  “Among  others,”  he  wrote,  “1  have  analyzed  the  distribution  of 
the  numbers  themselves,  their  residues  modulo  26,  their  cross  sums,  and  even 
their  autoregressive  patterns  ranging  from  frames  2 to  100.”  These  have  con- 
firmed to  his  satisfaction  that  Paper  No.  1 is  indeed  enciphered  in  the  same 
general  system  as  Paper  No.  2.  But  he  has  not  solved  the  cryptogram.  To  the 
man  who  does  will  go  one  of  the  richest  rewards  in  cryptanalysis. 

Cryptography  has  protected  not  only  material  secrets,  but  spiritual  ones 
as  well.  Secret  societies  have  long  used  ciphers.  The  Free  and  Accepted 
Masons  monopolized  the  antique  pigpen  cipher  to  such  an  extent  that  it  is 
often  called  the  Freemasons’  cipher.  Its  most  common  modern  form  is  this: 


Thus  Scottish  rite  would  be  enciphered  VLE»rVn  FT>0  . These  symbols 
stand  out  here  and  there  in  the  printed  manuals  of  Masonry;  they  comprise 
part  of  the  mixture  of  cryptography,  abbreviation,  and  rebus  with  which  the 
Masons  disguise  their  secret  rituals.  In  the  postbellum  South,  the  Knights  of 
the  Golden  Circle,  a kind  of  Ku  Klux  Klan,  used  essentially  the  same  cipher 
for  their  occasional  correspondences. 

In  its  early  days,  Phi  Beta  Kappa  had  strong  strains  of  secrecy,  and  a 
charter  sent  to  Harvard  in  1780  from  the  parent  body  at  Williamsburg 
required  that  “all  correspondencies  shall  be  through  the  President  of  each 
Society  by  means  of  the  Table  herewith  transmitted.”  It  consisted  of  13  re- 
ciprocal substitutions,  and  the  Harvard  chapter  used  it  in  a letter  of  March  23, 
1782,  to  the  Yale  chapter,  beginning  iz  bugz  bpwx  zundwzxb  fhhfn- 
barwbg  . . . (We  take  this  earliest  opportunity  . . .),  to  inform  them  of  the 
establishment  of  the  Harvard  chapter  and  to  invite  them  “to  the  advantages 
of  a literary  correspondence.”  The  members  took  their  cryptography  rather 
seriously,  for  the  president  of  the  Yale  chapter  wrote  Harvard  on  October  10: 
“I  must  observe  that  I have  now  written  many  things  which  ought  to  have 
been  written  by  the  T[abl]e  but  as  I forgot  to  obtain  it  before  I left  N.  Haven 
it  is  not  in  my  power  to  avail  myself  of  it.” 

The  Carbonari,  an  antimonarchical,  liberal,  secret  political  society  that 
flourished  in  Italy,  and  later  in  France,  early  in  the  19th  century,  may  have 
used  a cipher  based  on  a keyphrase.  This  phrase  was  written  beneath  the 
plaintext  alphabet,  thereby  becoming  the  ciphertext  alphabet.  Superscribed 
numerals  differentiated  repeated  letters  in  the  keyphrase.  Paul  Feval,  a 
prolific  author  of  popular  adventure  novels,  employed  such  a system  in  Les 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  773 

Compagnons  du  Silence,  a novel  published  in  1857  and  involving  a Carbonari- 
like secret  society.  The  keyphrase  was  the  fictional  society’s  motto,  meaning 
“Happy  friends,  let  us  go  to  suffering,”  but  Feval  erroneously  used  ALL1- 
EGRE  for  ALLEGRI,  throwing  most  of  the  phrase  out  of  phase: 

abcdef  ghij  kl  mnopqrst  uvxyz 

AMI  C I2  A2  L L2  I3  E O R E2  A3  N D I4  A1  M2  O A5  L3  L4  A6  P [E  N A] 

In  this,  carbonari  would  become  iaa4mna3aa4i3.  In  1834  a cryptogram 
with  a similar  aspect  was  seized  upon  a member  of  the  French  Carbonari. 

Though  the  whole  aim  of  science  is  to  bring  things  to  light,  scientists  have 
sometimes  had  to  conceal  their  results  for  fear  of  persecution.  Porta’s  Accade- 
mia  dei  Lincei  corresponded  in  cipher  with  Johann  Eck.  When  Galileo  Galilei 
discovered  with  his  new  telescope  that  Venus  went  through  phases  like  the 
moon,  thereby  powerfully  supporting  the  Copernican  theory,  he  risked  getting 
into  serious  trouble  with  the  Catholic  Church,  which  was  soon  to  declare  that 
theory  heretical.  Consequently  he  recorded  his  discovery  as  an  anagram  in  a 
letter  to  Johannes  Kepler:  haec  immatura  a me  jam  frustra  leguntur 
o.y.  (“These  unripe  things  are  now  read  by  me  in  vain”),  with  the  o.y.  two 
letters  that  he  could  not  fit  in.  The  plaintext  further  hid  the  names  of  the 
celestial  bodies  under  mythological  allusions,  referring  to  Venus’  character 
as  the  goddess  of  love,  and  Cynthia’s  as  the  goddess  of  the  moon:  Cynthiae 
figuras  aemulatur  mater  amorum  (“The  mother  of  love  imitates  the  phases  of 
Cynthia”).  In  the  same  way,  Christiaan  Huygens  established  his  priority  in 
the  discovery  that  Saturn  had  rings.  Instead  of  anagramming  his  plaintext 
into  another  sensible  text,  however,  he  simply  alphabetized  it  in  a letter  to  a 
friend:  7 a’s,  5 c’s,  1 d,  5 e’s,  1 g,  1 h,  7 i’s,  4 l’s,  2 m’s,  9 n’s,  4 o’s,  2 p’s,  1 
Q,  2 r’s,  1 S,  5 t’s,  and  5 u’s.  This  stood  for  Annulo  cingitur  tenui  piano, 
nusquam  cohaerente,  ad  ecliptican  inelinato  (“It  is  girdled  by  a thin  flat  ring, 
nowhere  touching,  inclined  to  the  ecliptic”).  In  1711,  the  great  English 
architect  Sir  Christopher  Wren,  stimulated  by  the  promise  of  a reward  offered 
by  Parliament  to  the  inventor  of  a means  of  determining  the  longitude  of  a 
ship  at  sea,  transmitted  three  short  cipher  messages  to  the  Royal  Society 
describing  three  instruments  for  this:  (1)  ozvcvayinixdncvocwedcnmal- 

NABECIRTEWNGRAMHHCCAW,  (2)  ZEIYEINOIEBIVTXESCIOCPSDEDMNANHSEFPRPI- 
WHDRAEHHXCIF,  (3)  EZKAVEBIMOXRFCSLCEEDHWMGNNIVEOMREWWERRCSHEP- 

CIP.  Each  was  to  be  read  backwards,  omitting  every  third  letter.  There  are  a 
few  errors.  Why  Wren  enciphered  something  that  he  should  have  been  making 
plain  as  day  remains  unknown,  but  in  any  event  he  did  not  win  the  reward. 

More  recently,  Alfred  C.  Kinsey  and  his  associates  encoded  the  replies  of 
interviewees  about  their  sexual  habits  for  Sexual  Behavior  in  the  Human 
Female.  Only  four  persons  on  the  staff  of  the  Institute  for  Sex  Research  could 
read  the  code,  which  recorded  the  answers  in  the  forms  of  x’s  and  a few 
checks,  dashes,  and  incomprehensible  abbreviations  in  columns.  Kinsey 
explained  that  “Recording  the  data  in  code  in  the  presence  of  the  subject  has 


774 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


done  a good  deal  to  convince  him  or  her  of  the  confidence  of  the  record.  Even 
though  anonymity  is  ordinarily  guaranteed  by  the  statement  which  caps  most 
questionnaires,  many  persons  still  fear  that  there  may  be  some  means  by 
which  they  can  be  identified  if  they  write  out  answers  to  printed  questions. 
They  fear,  and  not  without  some  justification  in  the  history  of  such  studies, 
that  a record  made  in  plain  English  may  be  read  by  other  persons  who  obtain 
access  to  the  file.  It  is  not  to  be  forgotten  that  our  sex  laws  and  public  opinion 
are  so  far  out  of  accord  with  common  and  everyday  patterns  of  social 
behavior  that  many  persons  might  become  involved  in  social  or  legal  diffi- 
culties if  their  sexual  histories  became  publicly  known.” 

Lovers  could  sometimes  find  themselves  in  the  same  difficulties  if  their 
liaisons  became  known.  Consequently  Ovid,  in  his  Art  of  Love,  offered  counsel 
on  how  to  correspond  clandestinely,  mentioning  some  primitive  forms  of 
secret  ink : 

Tuta  quoque  est  fallitque  oculus  e lacte  recenti 
Littera : carbonis  pulvere  tange,  leges. 

Fallet  et  umiduli  quae  fiet  acumine  lini, 

Et  feret  occultas  pura  tabella  notas. 

Or:  “A  letter  is  also  safe  and  escapes  the  eye  when  written  in  new  milk;  touch 
it  with  coal  dust  and  you  will  read.  That  too  will  deceive  which  is  written  with 
a stalk  of  moistened  flax,  and  a pure  sheet  will  bear  hidden  marks.”  He  also 
advised  using  pronouns  of  the  opposite  sex,  such  as  him  for  her. 

Secret  correspondence  among  lovers  ranges  from  simple  notes  clandes- 
tinely passed  in  schoolrooms  to  the  far  more  elaborate  systems  of  the  rich, 
the  royal,  and  the  famous.  In  1631,  John  Winthrop  the  younger,  a future 
governor  of  Connecticut,  then  in  his  twenties,  fell  in  love  with  his  cousin, 
Martha  Fones,  an  orphan  and  ward  of  his  father,  John,  first  governor  of  the 
Massachusetts  Bay  Colony.  Somehow  they  managed  to  get  married,  when  he 
was  24,  and,  since  the  mails  were  irregular  and  letters  were  sealed  only  with 
wax,  they  embowered  their  rather  lyrical  correspondence  the  next  year  within 
a monalphabetic  symbol  substitution,  he  from  London,  she  from  Groton. 
But  she  died  with  her  first-born  and  he  later  remarried.  In  the  1890s,  Seaman 
L.  Wetherell,  who  had  been  convicted  in  Vermont  of  having  had  sexual 
intercourse  with  a girl  under  14,  mailed  her  from  prison  a copy  of  The  Black 
Cat  magazine,  in  which  he  had  marked  and  dotted  certain  words  and  letters, 
spelling  out  what  the  court  ponderously  called  “a  communication  in  epistola- 
tory  form,  expressive  of  love,  and  containing  a request  to  write,  and  an 
injunction  to  remember  her  promise.”  Jonathan  Swift,  whose  pen  could  be 
sharper  and  more  satiric  than  any  man’s,  melted  into  almost  cloying  sweetness 
in  the  “little  language,”  which  was  not  much  more  than  a kind  of  baby  talk, 
of  his  Journal  to  Stella,  who  was  really  12-year-old  Esther  Johnson.  He  also 
used  a null  cipher,  in  which  only  the  alternate  letters  counted,  as  in  al 

BSADNUK  LBOINLPL  DFAONR  UFAINFBTOY  DPIONUFNAD  for  a bank  bill  for  fifty 

pound. 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  775 

Marie  Antoinette  maintained  a most  elaborate  cryptographic  menage  for 
amatory  correspondence,  which  with  her  often  had  political  overtones. 
Though  she  lived  in  the  age  of  the  nomenclator,  she  employed  a Porta-like 
cipher  for  correspondence  in  Italian,  and  another  based  on  the  novel  Paul  et 
Virginie  for  her  Paris  correspondence,  mostly  with  Bertrand  de  Moleville. 
She  enciphered  her  love  letters  to  Count  Axel  Fersen,  the  tall,  grave,  handsome 
young  Swede  who  was  apparently  her  lover  from  the  middle  of  1783,  after  his 
return  from  helping  America  in  the  Revolutionary  War.  “I  can  tell  you  that  I 
love  you  and  indeed  that  is  all  I have  time  for,”  one  letter  began.  It  ended, 
“Farewell,  most  loved  and  loving  of  men.  I kiss  you  with  all  my  heart.” 
Fersen  also  handled  the  voluminous  correspondence  of  the  Queen  and  the 
King  in  the  two  months  before  their  famous  attempt  to  escape  the  Revolution. 
He  used  a polyalphabetic  system  to  encipher  and  decipher  the  letters  to  and 
from  the  co-conspirators:

ab 

cd

The  letters  of  the  keyword  were  found  in  the  column  of  capitals  and  the 
plaintext  letter  sought  in  the  lowercase  pairs,  the  cipher  letter  being  the  other 
letter  of  the  pair.  Thus  with  key  B,  d = u and  u = d.  Fersen  used  as  keys  not 
words  like  ROI  or  LOUIS  or  ROYALE,  which  might  be  easily  guessed,  but 
simple  words  like  DEPUIS,  VOTRE,  BATTRE,  SEROIT,  and  so  on,  which 
he  changed  frequently.  In  addition,  he  represented  important  persons  by  a 
single  letter  in  a little  code  list:  b = Empress  of  Russia,  f = King  of  Spain, 
n = the  King,  R = Count  Fersen,  and  so  on.  The  messages  held  their  secret 
well,  including  the  one  of  May  26,  1791,  enciphered  with  the  keyword 
VERTU,  which  stated  that  “the  King  approves  the  route.”  It  was  not  crypto- 
graphy’s fault  that  the  escape  a few  days  later  of  Louis  and  Marie,  disguised 
as  servants  and  riding  in  a berlin,  was  discovered.  At  Varennes,  a cart  full  of 
furniture  barred  the  way  across  a little  bridge,  and  just  24  hours  after  Marie 
had  pretended  to  go  to  bed  at  the  Tuileries,  there  were  cries  of  “Stop!”  and 
the  King  and  Queen  of  France  and  their  family  were  again  prisoners  of  the 
Revolution — and,  eventually,  its  victims. 

Among  the  strange  means  of  secret  communication  to  which  lovers  in  the 
1800s  resorted  was  perhaps  the  most  public  of  all  channels — the  personal 
advertisements  in  newspapers,  sometimes  called  the  “agony  columns.” 
Apparently  unable  to  contact  one  another  directly  through  the  mails  because 
of  parental  or  other  restrictions,  the  lovers  could  easily  bring  a newspaper 
into  the  house  and  thus  receive  their  messages.  For  secrecy,  these  were 
enciphered,  but  usually  in  so  elementary  a system  that  anyone  who  applied 
himself  could  read  their  intimacies.  In  February  of  1853,  The  Times  of  London 
carried  a Caesar  substitution,  in  which  a = v,  addressed  to  Cenerentola:

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Until  my  heart  is  sick  have  I tried  to  frame  an  explanation  for  you,  but  cannot. 
Silence  is  safest,  if  the  true  cause  is  not  suspected.  If  it  is,  all  stories  will  be 
sifted  to  the  bottom.  Do  you  remember  our  cousin's first  proposition  ? Think  of  it. 
A few  months  later,  on  August  19,  the  same  paper  carried  a cryptogram  in  an 
ordinary  reversed  alphabet— a = z ,z  — A— with  numbers  representing  a few 
words  like  the  and  that.  The  message  began  My  darling,  need  I say  how  delighted 
I was  to  receive  your  letter  of  dear  remembrance  on  my  birthday?  I beg  you  not 
to  think  I wrote  under  any  irritation.  I fear  my  letters  being  read  by  others.  . . . 
Wheatstone  and  Babbage  often  amused  themselves  by  solving  these  simple 
missives.  Babbage  easily  read  a Caesar  substitution  of  May  13, 1859,  addressed 
to  Robert : Why  do  you  not  come  or  write  for  me  ? Such  grief  and  anxiety! — - 
Oh!  Love  Love!  His  most  difficult  was  a numerical  cryptogram  of  December 
21,  1853,  addressed  to  Flo  and  beginning  1821  82734  29  30  84541.  After, 
apparently,  months  of  trying  it  as  a polyalphabetic  and  as  a homophonic 
substitution,  he  finally  discovered  that  it  was  a polyphonic  substitution,  in 
which  each  cipher  number  stood  for  from  one  to  four  plaintext  letters.  It 
began  (with  two  enciphering  errors) : Thou  image  of  my  heart! 

Sometimes  people  inserted  cryptograms  just  to  see  if  anyone  would  make 
them  out.  A piece  of  advice  about  education,  enciphered  in  a Caesar  substitu- 
tion, dated  Kensington,  was  followed  a week  later  by  a cleartext  advertise- 
ment addressed  to  Kensington,  saying,  Your  cipher  is  made  out;  but  such  good 
maxims  should  be  written  in  plain  English,  that  all  might  benefit.  On  February 
10,  1852,  The  Times  was  used  to  circulate  calumny  against  itself— in  crypto- 
graphic form,  of  course:  tig  tjohw  it  tig  jfhiiwola  og  tig  psgvw.  It  stood 
for  The  Times  is  the  Jefferies  of  the  press,  enciphered  in  a progressive  Vigenere 
with  key  ABCD  . . . beginning  anew  with  each  word.  The  reference  to  George 
Jeffreys,  a 17th-century  English  judge,  meant  that  The  Times  was  a pusillani- 
mous tool  of  the  government  and  mercilessly  severe  to  its  opponents.  When 
the  editor  of  The  Times  heard  about  the  cryptogram,  he,  like  his  queen,  was 
not  amused.  The  family  of  the  explorer  Richard  Collinson  communicated  with 
him  privately  during  his  explorations  even  though  they  did  not  know  where  he 
was  by  inserting  coded  personal  notices  in  The  Times.  Use  of  the  enciphered 
personal  advertisement  seems  to  have  died  out,  however,  perhaps  owing  to 
the  censorship  restrictions  of  two  world  wars,  perhaps  because  of  the  tele- 
phone or  relaxed  parental  restrictions. 

Still  cryptography  serves  lovers.  Early  in  the  1930s,  Thelma,  Lady  Furness, 
was  being  courted  by  the  Prince  of  Wales,  later  to  become  Edward  VI 11.  They 
cabled  each  other  in  code.  “I  used  to  resent  the  time  it  took  me  to  decode 
them,”  she  gushed  later.  “When  one  is  in  love,  one  wants  to  know  everything 
all  at  once,  and  as  the  messages  were  usually  long,  it  seemed  to  take  forever 
to  find  out  what  they  said.  But  the  wait  was  always  worth  while  because  in 
code  one  need  not  leave  unsaid  all  the  things  dear  to  a woman  s heart. 
Unfortunately,  she  made  the  mistake,  on  the  eve  of  a visit  to  the  United 
States,  of  asking  a friend  to  look  after  the  prince  for  her  while  she  was  away. 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  777 

and  the  friend  promised  that  she  would.  Her  name  was  Wallis  Warfield 
Simpson. 

The  privacy  sought  in  such  communications  is  sometimes  sought  even  in 
missives  to  oneself — in  diaries  or  private  notebooks.  Well  known  are  the  note- 
books of  Leonardo  da  Vinci,  which  he  wrote  partly  in  his  left-handed  mirror 
writing,  partially  concealing  many  of  the  ideas  that  were  so  advanced  for  their 
time,  such  as  armored  military  vehicles  and  flying  machines.  Perhaps  the 
earliest  diary  to  be  kept  cryptographically  was  that  of  the  Swedish  govern- 
ment official  Erik  Brahe,  who  kept  one  in  secret  characters — a line  a day — 
from  1592  to  1601.  Others  followed.  In  colonial  America,  William  Byrd  of 
Virginia,  an  ancestor  of  the  late  Senator  Harry  F.  Byrd  of  the  same  state,  kept 
a diary  irregularly  for  a total  of  about  seven  years  between  1709  and  1741.  He 
wrote  in  shorthand,  using  a system  identified  late  in  the  1930s  by  Edward  J. 
Vogel,  a Chicago  court  stenographer  who  had  worked  in  Yardley’s  MI-8,  as 
William  Mason’s  “La  Plume  Volante,”  or  the  flying  pen.  Mrs.  Marion  Tin- 
ling  transcribed  it,  finding  some  difficulty  because  Byrd  often  omitted  the 
vowels  in  that  shorthand.  Parts  of  the  diary  are  still  unpublished,  presumably 
because  of  its  exceedingly  racy  character.

of  exile  on  Saint  Helena,  kept  a diary  in  such  highly  abbreviated  French  that 
it  was  virtually  a code.  The  entry  for  January  20,  1821,  reads:  “N.  so.  le  mat. 
en  cal:  il.  dej.  bi.  se.  trv.  un  peu  fat;  le  so.  il  est  fig.”  The  interpreter,  Paul 
Fleuriot  de  Langle,  who  called  his  work  “translating  from  French  into 
French— the  singular  sport  and  strange  pastime,”  rendered  this  passage  as 
Napoleon  sort  le  matin  en  caleche.  Il  dejeune  bien,  se  trouve  un  peu  fatigue;  le 
soir,  il  est  fort  gai  (“Napoleon  goes  out  in  the  morning  in  a carriage.  He 
lunches  well,  finds  himself  a little  tired;  in  the  evening,  he  is  very  gay”). 

Most  famous  of  secret  diaries — and  deservedly  so — is,  of  course,  Samuel 
Pepys’.  This  English  civil  servant  kept  his  tart,  frank  diary,  probably  the 
most  continuously  fascinating  ever  written,  from  January  1,  1660,  to  May  31, 
1669,  when  failing  eyesight  forced  him  to  discontinue  it.  It  fills  more  than 
3,000  closely  written  pages,  all  in  a shorthand  of  Thomas  Shelton’s  called 
“tachygraphy.”  Eleven  of  its  shorthand  letters  were  little  removed  from  the 
outlines  of  the  ordinary  longhand  forms,  and  it  had  five  places  for  the  vowel- 
dots,  but  a vowel  in  the  middle  of  a word  was  expressed  by  placing  the 
following  consonant  in  the  position  that  the  vowel-dot  would  have  assumed. 
Shelton  suggested  a list  of  contracted  words — books  of  the  Bible,  frequent 
sermon  phrases — and  gave  arbitrary  characters  to  265  common  words. 
Among  these  were  2 for  to,  a larger  2 for  two,  3 for  grace,  4 for  heart,  5 for 
because,  6 for  us,  and  so  on. 

Pepys  probably  learned  it  at  Magdalene  College,  Cambridge,  where  it  was 
in  favor;  he  seems  to  have  based  his  diary  upon  the  edition  of  1641,  appar- 
ently the  sixth  since  Shelton’s  first  publication  in  1620.  But  though  this 
apparently  widespread  knowledge  would  seem  to  have  made  it  impossible  for

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Pepys  to  have  used  shorthand  for  secrecy,  that  appears  in  fact  to  have  been 
one  of  his  motives  for  using  it.  In  the  first  place,  he  once  remarked  to  a friend 
about  how  undesirable  it  would  be  to  have  it  generally  known  that  he  kept  a 
diary.  In  the  second  place,  shorthand  was  uncommon  enough  in  17th- 
century  England  for  many  people  to  believe  it  could  be  used  as  a secret  cipher.

A page  of  Samuel  Pepys ’ original  shorthand  diary 

Some  Protestants,  fearing  that  the  Catholics  would  entirely  suppress  the 
Bible  if  they  had  the  opportunity,  copied  it  out  in  shorthand  to  preserve  it. 
Pepys  increased  the  secrecy  by  writing  the  more  salacious  passages  usually  in 
French,  sometimes  in  Latin,  Greek,  or  Spanish,  and  by  interpolating  null 
symbols  of  his  own  invention.  In  addition  to  the  secrecy  of  shorthand,  Pepys 
undoubtedly  liked  its  convenience,  and  much  of  the  charm  of  his  diary  may 
derive  from  the  mentally  uncensored  way  in  which  shorthand’s  speed  per- 
mitted him  to  write  it. 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  779 

The  six  small  octavo  volumes  of  the  diary  reposed  in  the  Pepysian  collec- 
tion at  Magdalene  College  for  three  or  four  generations  after  Pepys’  death, 
unread  beneath  its  semisecret  script.  Shelton’s  tachygraphy  had  joined  the 
multitude  of  all-but-forgotten  outdated  shorthand  systems;  the  volumes  con- 
tained no  key;  and  although  the  collection  included  Pepys’  longhand  trans- 
cript of  his  shorthand  account  of  the  adventures  of  Charles  II,  the  librarians 
did  not  know  about  it.  Upon  the  publication  of  the  diary  of  John  Evelyn, 
Pepys’  contemporary,  the  master  of  Magdalene  thought  that  Pepys’  diary 
might  also  shed  light  on  that  exciting  period  in  English  history,  since  Pepys 
had  held  some  high  posts  in  the  Admiralty.  He  showed  the  diary  apparently 
to  Thomas  Grenville,  a statesman  and  book  collector.  According  to  oral 
tradition  at  the  college,  Grenville  took  the  diary  up  to  bed  with  him  one 
evening  and  reappeared  at  breakfast  the  following  morning  with  several  pages 
deciphered.  He  gave  this  key  to  John  Smith,  an  undergraduate  in  St.  John’s 
College  and  a shorthand  reporter,  who  took  from  1819  to  1822,  working 
usually  12  or  14  hours  a day,  to  transcribe  the  diary.  He  did  it  with  skill 
and  accuracy — in  general,  only  half  a dozen  minor  errors  will  be  found  in  20 
pages. 

When  he  finished,  he  had  disclosed,  not  just  some  titillating  personal 
recollections,  but  a document  unparalleled  for  the  way  it  reveals  a man.  The 
diary  was  published  in  1825  and  has  probably  never  been  out  of  print  since. 
Smith  afterwards  spent  an  uneventful  life,  dying  in  1870  after  38  untroubled 
years  as  rector  at  Baldock,  Hertfordshire.  The  diary  has  become  a classic  of 
literature,  and  literature  must  owe  this  ornamant  in  part  to  the  cryptographic 
secrecy  of  the  shorthand,  in  which  Pepys  felt  safe  in  setting  down  his  most 
intimate,  his  most  human  thoughts. 

Cryptology  has  enriched  literature  in  other  ways.  Many  of  the  authors  of 
antiquity — among  them  Homer  and  Herodotus — mention  secret  writing.  But 
they  allude  to  events  believed  to  be  historical.  Not  until  the  Renaissance, 
when  cryptology  became  more  widely  used  and  hence  known  to  many  literate 
men,  could  it  serve  as  a topic  in  literature.  The  author  who  first  employed  it 
did  not  merely  brush  the  subject,  he  seized  it  with  both  hands,  danced  it 
around,  and  exuberantly  roared  out  a stream  of  mirth  poking  fun  at  the  whole 
business.  He  was,  naturally,  Francois  Rabelais: 

When  Pantagruel  had  read  the  superscription  [in  a missive  from  a lady,  saying 
“To  the  most  loved  by  the  fair  and  the  least  loyal  of  the  brave’’],  he  was  much 
amazed,  and  therefore  demanded  of  the  said  messenger  the  name  of  her  that  had 
sent  it : then  opened  he  the  letter,  and  found  nothing  written  in  it,  nor  otherwayes 
inclosed,  but  only  a gold  ring,  with  a square  table-diamond.  Wondering  at  this, 
he  called  Panurge  to  him,  and  shewed  him  the  case;  whereupon  Panurge  told 
him,  that  the  leafe  of  paper  was  written  upon,  but  with  such  cunning  and 
artifice,  that  no  man  could  see  the  writing  at  the  first  sight,  therefore  to  finde  it 
out  he  set  it  by  the  tire,  to  see  if  it  was  made  with  Sal  Ammoniack  soaked  in 


780

water;  then  put  he  it  into  the  water,  to  see  if  the  letter  was  written  with  the  juice 
of  Tithymalle:  after  that  he  held  it  up  against  the  candle,  to  see  if  it  was  written 
with  the  juice  of  white  onions. 

Then  he  rubbed  one  part  of  it  with  oile  of  nuts,  to  see  if  it  were  not  written 
with  the  lee  of  a fig-tree:  and  another  part  of  it  with  the  milk  of  a woman  giving 
suck  to  her  eldest  daughter,  to  see  if  it  was  written  with  the  blood  of  red  toads,  or 
green  earth-frogs : Afterwards  he  rubbed  one  corner  with  the  ashes  of  a Swallowes 
nest,  to  see  if  it  were  not  written  with  the  dew  that  is  found  within  the  herb 
Alcakengie,  called  the  winter-cherry.  He  rubbed  after  that  one  end  with  eare- 
wax,  to  see  if  it  were  not  written  with  the  gall  of  a Raven:  then  did  he  dip  it  into 
vinegar,  to  try  if  it  was  not  written  with  the  juice  of  the  garden  Spurge:  After 
that  he  greased  it  with  the  fat  of  a bat  or  flitter-mouse,  to  see  if  it  was  not  written 
with  the  sperm  of  a whale,  which  some  call  ambergris:  Then  put  it  very  fairly 
into  a basin  full  of  fresh  water,  and  forthwith  took  it  out,  to  see  whether  it  were 
written  with  stone-allum:  But  after  all  experiments,  when  he  perceived  that  he 
could  finde  out  nothing,  he  called  the  messenger,  and  asked  him.  Good  fellow, 
the  lady  that  sent  thee  hither,  did  she  not  give  thee  a staffe  to  bring  with  thee? 
thinking  that  it  had  been  according  to  the  conceit  whereof  Aulus  Gellius  maketh 
mention,  and  the  messenger  answered  him,  No,  Sir.  Then  Panurge  would  have 
caused  his  head  to  be  shaven,  to  see  whether  the  Lady  had  written  upon  his  bald 
pate,  with  the  hard  lie  whereof  sope  is  made,  that  which  she  meant;  but  perceiv- 
ing that  his  hair  was  very  long,  he  forbore,  considering  that  it  could  not  have 
grown  to  so  great  a length  in  so  short  a time. 

Then  he  said  to  Pantagruel,  Master,  by  the  vertue  of  G—  I cannot  tell  what 
to  do  nor  say  in  it;  for  to  know  whether  there  be  any  thing  written  upon  this  or 
no,  I have  made  use  of  a good  part  of  that  which  Master  Francisco  di  Nianto  the 
Tuscan  sets  down,  who  hath  written  the  manner  of  reading  letters  that  do  not 
appear;  that  which  Zoroastes  published,  Peri  grammaton  acritoir,  and  Cal- 
phurnius  Bassus,  de  Uteris  illegibilibus : but  1 can  see  nothing,  nor  do  1 beleeve 
that  there  is  any  thing  else  in  it  then  the  Ring:  let  us,  therefore,  look  upon  it. 

And  inside  the  ring,  of  course,  is  the  message  of  reprobation  from  the 
lady.  Half  of  this  lusty  episode— was  ever  a discussion  of  invisible  inks  ren- 
dered with  more  glee? — turns  on  real  things,  and  illustrates  Rabelais  vast 
erudition,  while  the  half  that  makes  it  an  outrageous  burlesque  is  purely 
Rabelais’  invention.  The  inks  made  with  ammonium  chloride,  onions,  alum, 
and  tithymallus  will  all  work,  while  the  red  toads,  the  ear  wax,  and  the  bat  fat 
lampoon  the  exotic  formulas  and  the  unnecessary  mystery  with  which  the 
would-be  magicians  of  the  day,  rather  like  Trithemius  and,  in  a different  way, 
like  Porta,  loved  to  surround  themselves.  The  staff,  of  course,  is  a skytale, 
which  the  Roman  writer  Aulus  Gellius  describes  in  his  Attic  Nights.  The  head- 
shaving story  kids  Herodotus’  tale  of  Histaeius  and  his  tattooing  of  a secret 
message  on  a slave’s  head.  The  three  books  are  purely  imaginary.  And  the 
climax  of  the  episode— with  the  message  just  where  they  should  have  looked 
to  begin  with— satirizes  the  whole  business  of  unearthing  secret  messages. 
Here,  in  the  volcanic  writings  of  a titan,  cryptology  explodes  into  incandescent 
literary  life. 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  78 1 

The  greatest  writer  of  all,  William  Shakespeare,  never  mentioned  crypto- 
logy as  such,  but  did  touch  upon  its  older  brother,  interception.  In  Henry  V, 
Henry’s  brother,  the  Duke  of  Bedford,  is  discussing  with  two  other  peers  a 
conspiracy  that  three  other  lords  were  hatching  against  the  king.  “The  King 
hath  note  of  all  that  they  intend, /By  interception  which  they  dream  not  of,” 
Bedford  says.  Not  long  thereafter  Henry  presents  the  three  traitors  with 
proofs  of  their  guilt — probably  the  intercepted  letters  themselves.  The  effect  is 
dramatic:  “Why,  how  now,  Gentlemen ?/What  see  you  in  those  papers  that 
you  lose/So  much  complexion  ?”  Henry  exclaims.  “Look  ye,  how  they  change ! 
/Their  cheeks  are  paper.  Why,  what  read  you  there/That  hath  so  cowarded 
and  chas’d  your  blood/Out  of  appearance?”  They  immediately  confess,  and, 
in  the  play,  are  promptly  executed. 

Though  this  was  a historical  play,  Shakespeare’s  sources — the  chronicles 
of  Raphael  Holinshed  and  of  Edward  Hall — do  not  mention  interception. 
This  aspect  must  therefore  have  sprung  from  Shakespeare’s  imagination, 
which  may  have  drawn  its  inspiration  from  the  knowledge,  probably  fairly 
common  then,  that  letters  were  intercepted  and  opened  by  the  authorities  to 
obtain  information. 

It  perhaps  testifies  to  Shakespeare’s  scope  that  discussions  of  cryptology 
in  works  of  the  imagination  in  the  200  years  that  succeeded  his  appear  non- 
existent, or  at  least  were  so  rare  and  tangential  to  the  main  theme  of  a work 
that  they  left  no  traces  in  the  critical  literature.  Then,  in  1829,  literary  crypto- 
logy took  a step  sideways  when  Honore  de  Balzac  published  The  Physiology 
of  Marriage,  one  of  the  works  that  make  up  his  immense  Human  Comedy.  It 
is  a long,  amusing,  sardonic  dissertation  on  marriage,  and  in  a section  on 
“Religion  and  confession,  considered  in  their  relation  with  marriage,” 
Balzac  wrote:  “La  Bruyere  has  said  very  spiritually:  ‘It  is  too  much  against  a 
husband  [to  require  both]  devotion  and  gallantry:  a wife  must  choose.’  The 
author  thinks  that  La  Bruyere  is  mistaken.  In  reality,” — and  there  followed 
four  pages  of  the  most  confused  typographical  mishmash,  with  letters  upside 
down,  letters  sideways,  type  standing  on  its  head  and  printing  on  its  feet,  none 
of  it  making  the  least  bit  of  sense,  but  with  a final  “en  effet”  slyly  inserted 
near  the  end.  In  the  errata,  which  serve  “to  caution  you  against  the  errors  you 
have  made  in  reading  this  work,”  Balzac  cited  the  four  pages  and  observed: 
“To  really  understand  the  sense  of  these  pages,  a reader  who  is  honest  with 
himself  ought  to  reread  its  principal  passages  several  times;  for  the  author  has 
placed  all  his  thought  there.” 

Could  it  be  a real  cryptogram?  Commandant  Bazeries  wondered,  and, 
taking  a later  edition,  analyzed  the  cryptic  text,  found  the  cryptogram  to  be 
neither  a transposition  nor  a substitution,  and  concluded  that  it  was  no 
cipher  at  all.  He  could  have  determined  this  more  easily  simply  by  comparing 
his  edition  with  the  first,  or  with  any  one  of  the  successive  editions — some  of 
which  appeared  during  Balzac’s  lifetime.  He  would  have  seen  that  Balzac, 
evidently  not  wishing  to  reveal  his  feelings  on  religion  and  confession,  had

Heterogeneous  Impulses  783 

ordered  his  printer  to  set  pi,  for  the  “cryptogram”  changed  from  one  edition 
to  the  next ! 

A few  years  later,  literary  cryptology  took  its  greatest  step  forward  with  the 
work  of  Edgar  Allan  Poe,  whose  story  “The  Gold-Bug”  remains  unequalled 
as  a work  of  fiction  turning  upon  a secret  message. 

That  the  early  American  writer  should  have  become  interested  in  crypto- 
logy seems  almost  inevitable.  He  urged  exactness  in  thinking,  talked  about 
“ratiocination,”  and  wrote  stories,  like  “The  Purloined  Letter,”  that  de- 
manded a methodical  logic.  But  he  also  wrote  poems  of  an  unearthly  beauty 
and  the  macabre  Tales  of  the  Grotesque  and  Arabesque,  and  he  looked  into 
such  irrational  subjects  as  mesmerism  and  phrenology.  Cryptology,  more  than 
other  subjects,  is  split  the  same  way.  It  beams  the  hard  bright  searchlight  of 
reason  upon  the  phenomena  it  investigates.  At  the  same  time  it  glimmers  with 
the  pale,  eerie,  indistinct  moonshine  of  mysticism  and  spooky  powers.  This 
double  aspect  of  cryptology  played  upon  Poe’s  dual  nature— its  science  upon 
his  intellect,  its  occultism  upon  his  emotions— and  aroused  thereby  a whole- 
souled  response. 

Evidence  of  Poe’s  interests  in  writing  and  mystery  appeared  in  The 
Narrative  of  Arthur  Gordon  Pym,  when  outlines  on  maps  and  fiakings  of 
cavern  walls  inexplicably  spelled  out  words  in  Ethiopian  and  Arabic.  His 
first  known  mention  of  cryptology  itself  occurred,  however,  in  an  article 
entitled  “Enigmatical  and  Conundrum-ical”  that  appeared  in  the  December 
18,  1839,  issue  of  Alexander's  Weekly  Messenger,  a Philadelphia  newspaper. 
After  printing  a riddle  that  had  baffled  one  of  the  paper’s  subscribers,  Poe 
wrote : 


We  sympathize  with  our  correspondent’s  perplexity,  and  hasten  to  remove  it 
— especially  as  we  have  a penchant  for  riddles  ourselves.  In  spite  of  the  anathemas 
of  the  over-wise,  we  regard  a good  enigma  as  a good  thing.  Their  solution 
affords  one  of  the  best  possible  exercises  of  the  analytical  faculties,  besides  calling 
into  play  many  other  powers.  We  know  of  no  truer  test  of  general  capacity  than 
is  to  be  found  in  the  guessing  of  such  puzzles.  In  explanation  of  this  idea  a most 
capital  Magazine  article  might  be  written.  It  would  be  by  no  means  a labor  lost 
to  show  how  great  a degree  of  rigid  method  enters  into  enigma-guessing.  So  much 
is  this  the  case,  that  a set  of  rules  might  absolutely  be  given  by  which  almost  any 
(good)  enigma  in  the  world  could  be  solved  instantaneously.  This  may  sound 
oddly;  but  is  not  more  strange  than  the  well  known  fact  that  rules  really  exist, 
by  means  of  which  it  is  easy  to  decipher  any  species  of  hieroglyphical  writing 
that  is  to  say  writing  where,  in  place  of  alphabetical  letters,  any  kind  of  marks 
are  made  use  of  at  random.* 

And  the  footnote  to  this  read: 

* For  example — in  place  of  A put  t or  any  other  arbitrary  character  in 
place  of  B,  a *,  &c.  &c.  Let  an  entire  alphabet  be  made  in  this  manner,  and  then 
let  this  alphabet  be  used  in  any  piece  of  writing.  This  writing  can  be  read  by

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


means  of  a proper  method.  Let  this  be  put  to  the  test.  Let  any  one  address  us  a 
letter  in  this  way,  and  we  pledge  ourselves  to  read  it  forthwith— however  unusual 
or  arbitrary  may  be  the  characters  employed. 

Replies  poured  in  on  Poe.  At  first  they  came  just  from  Philadelphia  and 
environs,  but  later  they  arrived  from  Alabama,  Massachusetts,  New  York, 
Ohio,  Indiana,  and  Iowa — the  correspondent  from  Iowa  being  17-year-old 
Schuyler  Colfax,  later  to  be  Vice  President  in  Grant’s  first  term.  The  cipherers 
used  wild  combinations  of  asterisks,  question  marks,  numbers,  paragraph 
marks,  and  once  “the  ugliest  and  drollest  hieroglyphics  imaginable  (we  having 
no  type  in  our  office  which  would  come  within  a mile  of  them).”  The  volume 
increased  so  that  he  asked  his  readers:  “Do  people  really  think  that  we  have 
nothing  in  the  world  to  do  but  to  read  hieroglyphics?  or  that  we  are  going  to 
stop  our  ordinary  business  and  set  up  for  conjurers?  Will  any  body  tell  us 
how  to  get  out  of  this  dilemma?  If  we  don’t  solve  all  the  puzzles  forwarded, 
their  concocters  will  think  it  is  because  we  cannot — when  we  can.  If  we  do 
solve  them  we  shall  soon  have  to  enlarge  our  sheet  to  ten  times  the  size  of  the 
Brother  Jonathan”  (a  “mammoth”  New  York  newspaper  about  two  feet  by 
three).  Things  never  got  that  bad,  but  the  great  number  of  messages  afforded 
Poe  a lucky  opportunity  to  explain  why  he  limited  his  challenge  to  ciphers 
that  were — for  him — so  easy  to  solve:  “Were  we  to  engage  in  the  solution  of 
every  kind  of  puzzle  sent  us,  we  should  have  our  hands  full.  We  said  that  we 
could  and  would  solve  every  cipher,  of  a stipulated  character,  which  we  should 
receive,  and  we  have  kept  our  pledge  more  than  ten  times  over.” 

In  the  15  numbers  of  Alexander's  Weekly  Messenger  in  which  he  had 
articles  on  cipher,  Poe  published  the  ciphertexts  and  solutions  of  1 1 crypto- 
grams and  the  solutions  only  of  16;  he  merely  stated  that  he  had  solved  three 
others.  Six  he  had  not  solved:  one  he  had  lost,  one  he  had  had  no  time  to 
examine,  one  was  written  in  pencil  and  defaced,  two  were  “impositions" 
(false  cryptograms),  and  one  had  51  different  cipher  characters  and  hence  lay 
outside  the  limits  of  strict  monalphabeticity  with  no  homophones  that  he  had 
laid  down  in  his  original  challenge. 

During  all  these  months,  he  never  once  revealed  how  he  solved  the  crypto- 
grams, though  his  readers  begged,  “Just  let  us  into  the  secret,  as  we  are  fond 
of  the  marvelous.”  Teased  Poe:  “Well,  what  will  he  give  us  for  the  secret?— 
it  is  a wonderful  one  and  well  worth  paying  for.  Let  him  send  us  on  a list  of 
forty  subscribers,  with  the  money,  and  we  will  give  him  a full  explanation  of 
our  whole  method  of  proceeding.”  After  solving  an  alliterative  message  that 
used,  apparently,  a different  alphabet  for  each  line,  he  promised  to  reveal  his 
method  of  solution.  But  he  evidently  realized  that  the  mystery  heightened 
interest,  for  in  the  next  issue  he  recanted:  “Upon  second  thought,  we  must 
decline  giving  our  mode  of  solution  for  the  present.” 

The  closest  he  ever  came  to  doing  so  was  when  he  demonstrated  how  he 
deduced  that  a challenge  sent  him  by  G.  W.  Kulp,  of  Lewiston,  Pennsylvania, 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  785 

was  a false  cryptogram.  He  picked  out  three  words  in  the  cryptogram — mw, 
laam,  and  mlw.  Since  “all  English  words  of  but  two  letters  consist  of  a 
vowel  and  a consonant,”  he  wrote,  mw  must  be  one  of  30  words,  which  he 
listed.  He  then  inserted  every  letter  of  the  alphabet  in  the  middle  of  all  30 
words  in  an  exhaustive  trial  process  to  see  which  letters  would  make  a sensible 
word  out  of  mlw.  Here  he  found  18,  including  ash  and  tho'.  Turning  to 
laam,  he  observed,  that  “if  mlw  be  ash,  then  laam  will  be  a word  of  this  form, 
s . . a,  in  which  the  dots  represent  two  unknown  letters  of  the  same  kind.” 
He  ran  through  his  18  words  in  this  way,  and  found  that  the  only  one  that 
gave  a possible  meaning  for  laam  was  h . . t,  or  hoot,  “laam  is  then  hoot  or 
nothing.  But  the  hypothesis  of  the  word  hoot  is  founded  upon  that  of  the  word 
tho' . . . . We  now  arrive  at  a definite  conclusion.  Either  Mr.  Kulp’s  puzzle  is 
not  genuine,  or  mw  stands  for  to,  mlw  for  tho',  and  laam  for  hoot.  But  it  is 
evident  that  this  latter  cannot  be — for  in  that  case  both  w and  A represent  the 
letter  o.  What  follows? — why  that  Mr.  Kulp’s  puzzle  is  no  puzzle  at  all.  This 
demonstration  is  as  absolutely  conclusive  as  any  mathematical  one  could  be. 
The  process  of  reasoning  here  employed  is  that  employed  also  in  the  solution 
of  the  cyphers.” 

All  his  Alexander's  cryptograms  were  simple  monalphabetics  with  word 
divisions  (except  one  which  appears  to  have  been  some  kind  of  Cardano  grille, 
whose  solution  only  he  gives).  None  of  Poe’s  correspondents  tried  to  stump 
him  with  puzzle-type  cryptograms  that  use  bizarre  words  and  twisted  syntax, 
which  would  have  been  perfectly  within  the  limits  of  his  rules.  In  fact,  they 
often  made  it  especially  easy  for  him  by  using  well-known  pieces  for  their 
plaintext,  such  as  the  Lord’s  Prayer  or  the  opening  lines  of  Twelfth  Night. 
Identification  of  a word  or  two  of  these  would  give  away  the  entire  message, 
and  indeed  “a  single  glance”  enabled  Poe  to  read  the  Lord’s  Prayer  crypto- 
gram. Most  employed  symbol  alphabets  constructed  without  any  key, 
though  one  correspondent  actually  used  an  a = 1,  b = 2,  . . . , z = 26 
substitution.  Poe  solved  them  quickly:  “Our  correspondent  will  know  by  the 
date  of  his  communication,  that  we  could  only  have  received  it  on  the  morn- 
ing when  we  go  to  press  (Tuesday) — consequently  we  must  have  read  his 
puzzle  instanter,"  he  wrote  in  giving  his  first  solution  in  Alexander's.  He  also 
solved  some  sloppily,  giving  solutions  with  errors  or  omissions.  This  rather 
suggests  that  he  attacked  his  cryptograms  inductively,  guessing  at  words  by 
trying  combinations  ol  letters,  as  in  the  Kulp  demonstration,  rather  than 
carefully  analyzing  ciphertext  frequencies  and  characteristics.  This  intuitive 
approach,  which  offers  a bolder  and  easier  solution,  would  accord  well  with 
his  habits  of  thought  and  work. 

Poe’s  solutions  for  Alexander's  became  the  narrow  foundation  upon  which 
he  erected  an  exaggerated  reputation  as  a cryptanalyst.  He  enlarged  the 
foundation  slightly  in  1841  when  he  solved  cryptograms  in  a polyphonic 
substitution,  a little  more  difficult  than  ordinary  monalphabetic  substitu- 
tion, submitted  by  readers  of  another  magazine.  It  was  his  publicitywise  skill 


786 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


at  magnifying  these  rather  ordinary  deeds,  however,  plus  the  testimony  of 
others,  that  created  the  legend  of  his  almost  supernatural  cryptanalytical 
prowess.  An  article  on  “Quick  Perception”  in  the  Philadelphia  Saturday 
Museum  in  1843  reported  how  Poe  was  shown  a cryptogram  and  “immed- 
iately” gave  the  answer.  He  supplied  material  for  a biography  of  himself  in 
the  same  issue  which  cited  the  most  difficult  cryptogram  that  he  had  ever 
solved  as  the  easiest:  “This  cryptograph,  however,”  the  article  observed 
falsely,  “was  simplicity  itself  in  comparison  with  others  resolved  by  the 
subject  of  our  memoir.”  A friend  reported  in  a letter  how  Poe  solved  a crypto- 
gram “in  a much  shorter  time”  than  it  took  to  encipher  it — and  Poe  promptly 
published  the  letter.  The  legend  appeared  in  full  flower  less  than  a year  after 
Poe’s  death.  A Massachusetts  clergyman,  telling  how  Poe  read  a cryptogram 
“in  one-fifth  of  the  time  it  took  ...  to  write  it,”  concluded  that  “The  most 
profound  and  skilful  cryptographer  who  ever  lived  was  undoubtedly  Edgar 
A.  Poe.” 

The  myth  has  shrunk  since  then.  But  vestiges  linger.  Poe  student  W.  K. 
Wimsatt,  Jr.,  has  contended  that  Poe’s  cryptanalytic  powers  were  “far  beyond 
the  ordinary.”  Beyond  the  ordinary  individual,  of  course,  and  even  beyond 
the  person  who  may  have  a curiosity  about  ciphers.  But  not  beyond  the 
ordinary  amateur.  Most  amateurs  that  do  any  solving  at  all  solve  mon- 
alphabetics  with  quite  the  same  facility  as  Poe.  Just  a modicum  of  experience 
endows  a solver  with  an  apparently  miraculous  facility  to  recognize  words  and 
word-patterns  at  a glance — kvbk  stands  out  as  that,  kvili  as  there,  avtov  as 
which.  The  solution  of  such  ciphers  is  not  only  simple  but  also  becomes, 
upon  the  slightest  practice,  mechanical.  On  the  available  evidence,  then,  it  is 
wrong  to  say  that  Poe’s  cryptanalytic  skill  exceeded  the  ordinary.  But  what 
about  his  latent  capacity,  what  Wimsatt  called  his  “native  power”?  Other 
amateur  cryptologists  of  the  day — Babbage,  Wheatstone,  Kasiski — some- 
times solved  ciphers  much  more  difficult  than  monalphabetic  substitution. 
Would  Poe  have  been  able  to  do  so  too?  The  question  is  unanswerable.  Poe 
limited  himself  to  the  simplest  kind  of  cipher.  To  decide  on  the  basis  of  no 
evidence  whether  he  did  so  because  he  feared  to  tackle  the  more  complicated 
systems,  or  because,  as  he  said,  he  did  not  have  time,  would  be  arbitrary  and 
useless. 

Nevertheless,  Poe’s  reputed  cryptanalytic  superiority  has  colored  the 
whole  picture  of  the  man.  “Doubtless  nothing  contributed  to  a greater  extent 
than  did  Poe’s  connection  with  cryptography  to  the  growth  of  the  legend  which 
pictures  him  as  a man  at  once  below  and  above  ordinary  human  nature,” 
wrote  Joseph  Wood  Krutch.  For  by  associating  himself  with  cryptology,  Poe 
clothed  himself  in  the  spectral  aura  that  has  always  shimmered  about  it. 

Poe  quit  Alexander's  in  May  of  1840.  A year  later,  when  he  had  become 
editor  of  Graham's  Magazine  in  Philadelphia,  he  found  an  opportunity  to 
exploit  the  same  sure  vein  of  journalistic  interest  that  he  had  struck  in 
Alexander's.  Reviewing  Sketches  of  Conspicuous  Living  Characters  of  France 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  787 

in  the  issue  of  April,  1841,  he  offered,  in  almost  the  same  words  he  had  used 
in  Alexander's,  to  read  cryptograms  that  readers  might  send  him: 

In  the  notice  of  [the  lawyer  Antoine]  Berryer  it  is  said  that,  a letter  being 
addressed  by  the  Duchess  of  Berry  to  the  legitimists  of  Paris,  to  inform  them  of 
her  arrival,  it  was  accompanied  by  a long  note  in  cypher,  the  key  of  which  she 
had  forgotten  to  give.  “The  penetrating  mind  of  Berryer,”  says  our  biographer, 
“soon  discovered  it.  It  was  this  phrase  substituted  for  the  twenty-four  letters  of 
the  alphabet — Le gouvernement provisoireY' 

All  this  is  very  well  as  an  anecdote;  but  we  cannot  understand  the  extra- 
ordinary penetration  required  in  the  matter.  . . . anyone  who  will  take  the 
trouble  may  address  us  a note,  in  the  same  manner  as  here  proposed,  and  the 
keyphrase  may  be  in  either  French,  Italian,  Spanish,  German,  Latin,  or  Greek 
(or  in  any  of  the  dialects  of  these  languages),  and  we  pledge  ourselves  for  the 
solution  of  the  riddle.  The  experiment  may  afford  our  readers  some  amusement 
— let  them  try  it. 

The  keyphrase  cipher,  which  apparently  has  never  been  used  in  practical 
cryptography  before  or  after  the  Duchess  of  Berry,*  uses  the  keyphrase  as  a 
substitution  alphabet: 

abcdefghij  lmnopqrst  uvxyz 
LEGOUVERNEMENTPROVI  SOI  RE 

The  French  plaintext  vraiment  (“truly”),  which  has  no  repeated  letters,  would 
become  oolneuni.  Thus,  o represents  both  v and  r,  and  n both  i and  n. 
The  keyphrase  produces  a polyphonic  substitution — one  in  which  a given 
ciphertext  letter  may  stand  for  two  or  more  different  plaintext  letters,  and 
which  consequently  may  create  some  decipherment  ambiguities.  Its  ciphertext 
may  exhibit  such  dismaying  peculiarities  as  three  or  four  identical  ciphertext 
letters  in  a row.  But  any  difficulties  that  this  may  occasion  the  cryptanalyst  are 
counterbalanced  by  the  coherence  of  the  keyphrase,  which  he  reconstructs 
along  with  the  ciphertext. 

While  waiting  for  responses  to  his  challenge,  Poe  wrote  “A  Few  Words  on 
Secret  Writing,”  the  longest  of  his  writings  on  cryptology,  for  the  July 
Graham's.  It  comprised  a medley  of  cryptographic  information,  presented 
with  pace  and  vigor  but  giving  little  new.  It  did  include  a dictum  that  he  had 
promulgated  in  Alexander's  but  that  here  assumed  the  form  in  which  it  be- 
came classic  in  cryptology — long  considered  a truism  but  now  known  to  be 

* And  perhaps  not  even  by  her.  The  system  described  is  virtually  the  same  as  that  appar- 
ently used  by  the  Carbonari  at  the  same  period  except  that  the  superscribed  differentiating 
numbers  are  omitted.  It  may  well  have  been  Berryer’s  biographer  who  omitted  them,  either 
because  someone  did  not  give  him  all  the  details  of  the  system  or  because  he  misunderstood. 
It  is  true  that  the  Duchess  of  Berry  was  a royalist  and  the  Carbonari  were  antimonarchical, 
but  both  were  opposed  to  the  line  then  occupying  the  throne  upon  the  Duchess’  return  to 
France  in  1832.  They  might  have  shared  the  Carbonari  system,  or,  more  probably,  it  might 
have  just  been  in  the  air  at  that  time  and  therefore  widely  used.  Thus  the  keyphrase  cipher 
may  owe  its  existence  to  Poe’s  creating  it  as  a result  of  a mistake!

false:  “It  may  be  roundly  asserted  that  human  ingenuity  cannot  concoct  a 
cipher  which  human  ingenuity  cannot  resolve.  Most  of  the  article  s “scraps 
of  erudition,”  as  critic  Wimsatt  well  put  it,  came  straight  from  the  Encyclo- 
paedia Britannica,  and  perhaps  also  from  the  Encyclopaedia  Americana.  Poe 
faithfully  reproduced  the  Britannica s error  in  abbreviating  Giovanni 
Battista  Porta’s  name  as  “Cap.  Porta.”  Poe  here  gave  cryptology  its  first 
discussion  of  skytale  cryptanalysis:  wrap  the  strip  of  parchment  around  a 
cone  and  slide  it  up  and  down  until  sense  appears;  the  diameter  of  the  cone 
at  that  point  is  the  diameter  of  the  skytale.  But  he  still  did  not  say  anything 
about  how  to  solve  the  monalphabetic  substitutions;  he  still  did  not  disclose 
the  secret  for  which  his  readers  had  clamored.  Indeed,  he  deepened  the 
mystery.  He  concluded  the  article  by  stating  (incorrectly)  that  one  could  find 
in  writings  on  cryptology  no  rules  for  solving  ciphers  that  one  did  not  “in 
his  own  intellect  possess." 

On  July  1,  a friend  in  Washington,  F.  W.  Thomas,  a novelist  who  held  a 
position  in  the  Treasury  Department  and  who  was  helping  Poe  in  his  efforts 
to  get  a government  job,  forwarded  two  keyphrase  cryptograms  from  a friend 
of  his  who  had  accepted  Poe’s  challenge  in  the  April  Graham's.  Poe  solved 
one  of  them  at  once;  the  other  had  the  same  keyphrase:  BUT  FIND  THIS 
OUT  AND  I GIVE  IT  UP.  It  was  the  most  difficult  he  had  ever  solved,  owing 
to  its  plaintext,  part  of  which  read:  Without  dubiety  incipient  pretension  is  apt 
to  terminate  in  final  vulgarity,  as  parturient  mountains  have  been  fabulated  to 
produce  muscupular  abortions.  Elatedly,  he  sent  the  solution  to  Thomas  by 
return  of  post”  on  July  4,  asking  for  testimonials.  These  he  used  in  the  August 
issue  of  Graham's,  in  which  he  published  the  text  of  the  cryptogram  and 
offered  a year’s  subscription  to  Graham's  and  The  Saturday  Evening  Post  to 
the  first  solver.  A few  days  after  sending  this  number  to  press,  he  received 
another  cipher  from  Thomas,  this  one  from  the  son  of  the  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury,  to  whom  Thomas  had  been  speaking  of  Poe.  “Decypher  Mr.  P. 
Ewing’s  cryptograph  in  your  August  number  if  you  can — Let  me  have  it  by 
return  of  mail,”  Thomas  wrote.  But  it  did  not  yield  to  Poe’s  analyses,  and  Poe, 
who  up  to  this  point  had  apparently  depended  solely  upon  rules  that  he 
already  possessed  in  his  own  intellect,  and  who  might  have  been  helped  in 
getting  a job  he  wanted  if  he  solved  the  Ewing  cipher,  sought  new  sources  of 
information. 

Several  times  before,  he  had  had  good  results  with  The  Cyclopaedia  of 
Abraham  Rees,  finding  materials  for  articles  on  Palestine  and  Stonehenge. 
Now  he  turned  to  it  again  and  this  time  discovered  the  superb  article  on 
“Cipher”  by  William  Blair,  an  English  surgeon.  It  ran  30  pages  and  about 
35,000  words — the  length  of  a small  book — and  for  almost  a century,  or  until 
Parker  Hitt  wrote  his  Manual  for  the  Solution  of  Military  Ciphers  in  1916,  it 
remained  the  finest  treatise  in  English  on  cryptology.  Blair  had  done  con- 
siderable original  research  among  manuscripts  for  historical  material;  he 
described  thoroughly  the  major  systems  of  cryptography  and  gave  the  bases 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  789 

of  cryptanalysis  and  a number  of  examples — including  attempts  taken  (with 
credit)  from  Falconer,  to  solve  polyalphabetics.  On  the  back  of  the  envelope 
of  Thomas’  letter,  Poe  copied  a variety  of  linguistic  observations — “y 
seldom  in  middle  of  word” — plus  what  appears  to  have  been  his  first  and  only 
frequency  count,  though  from  his  work  with  printers  he  must  have  already 
been  aware  that  letters  differ  in  their  frequency  of  use. 

In  giving  the  frequencies,  Blair  had  divided  vowels  from  consonants  and 
had  ranked  the  frequencies  of  the  consonants  in  four  groups,  in  each  of  which 
he  listed  the  individual  consonants  alphabetically:  “To  find  out  one  consonant 
from  another,  you  must  observe  the  frequency  of  d,  h,  n,  r,  s,  t;  and  next  to 
those,  c,f,  g,  /,  m,  w;  in  a third  rank  may  be  placed  b,  k,p,  and  lastly,  q,  x,  z." 
As  for  the  vowels,  “you  will  generally  find  e occur  the  oftenest;  next,  o,  then 
a,  and  but  u,  and  y,  are  not  so  often  used  as  some  of  the  consonants, 
especially  s and  t."  In  compressing  Blair’s  information,  Poe  ignored  Blair’s 
distinctions,  erroneously  transposed  a and  o,  and  listed  as  the  “order  of 
frequency  eaoidhnrstuycfglmwbkpqx  z.”  Both  Blair  and  Poe 
omitted  j and  v. 

This  help,  however,  did  not  enable  Poe  to  solve  the  Ewing  cipher,  which 
was  very  short.  Nor  did  he  use  this  frequency  count  for  notes  on  cryptology 
in  the  October  and  December  issues  of  Graham's,  though  he  did  make  use  of 
much  of  Blair’s  information — without  ever  giving  credit  to  the  source.  In 
fact  he  made  it  appear  as  if  the  knowledge  were  his.  For  example,  on  the 
basis  of  the  Blair-Falconer  discussion  of  polyalphabetic  solution,  he  wrote  in 
December  regarding  the  Vigenere  tableau:  “Out  of  a thousand  individuals 
nine  hundred  and  ninety-nine  would  at  once  pronounce  this  mode  inscrut- 
able. It  is  yet  susceptible,  under  peculiar  circumstances,  of  prompt  and  certain 
solution.”  Poe’s  readers  no  doubt  drew  the  conclusion  that  he  wanted  them 
to  draw  about  just  who  could  effect  that  solution. 

Cryptology  had  made  the  biggest  hit  of  any  of  his  journalistic  writings.  A 
story  based  upon  the  sure-fire  topic  of  a secret  message  seemed  a natural,  and 
a story  explaining  the  technique  of  cryptanalysis— the  mystery  with  which  he 
had  teased  his  readers  for  two  years — seemed  a certain  success.  Half  a dozen 
years  before,  he  had  reviewed  Robert  M.  Bird's  Sheppard  Lee,  whose  hero 
frantically  searched  for  the  legendary  treasure  of  the  pirate  Captain  William 
Kidd.  Poe  remembered  a comical  Negro  servant  from  the  novel,  and  this 
brought  back  his  Army  days  in  the  South  in  1828,  when  he  served  at  Fort 
Moultrie  on  Sullivan’s  Island,  outside  Charleston,  South  Carolina.  Sullivan  s 
Island  became  the  locale  of  the  story  and,  recalling  some  natural  history 
studies  with  an  acquaintance  there,  Poe  combined  the  click  beetle,  Alaus 
oculatus,  with  its  death’s-head  spots,  and  the  gold  beetle,  the  gleaming 
Callichroma  splendidum,  into  the  gold-bug  that  gave  its  name  to  the  story 
he  wrote. 

In  spite  of  the  story’s  length,  George  Rex  Graham,  the  publisher  of 
Graham's  Magazine,  snapped  it  up.  He  paid  only  a minimum  price,  however, 


790 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


and  when  Poe  heard  that  the  Dollar  Newspaper  was  offering  a $100  prize  for 
the  best  story,  he  got  “The  Gold-Bug”  back  from  Graham  and  entered  it 
in  the  competition.  (Unable  to  return  Graham’s  money,  he  had  to  make  it  up 
with  a series  of  reviews.)  “The  Gold-Bug”  won  the  prize  and  was  published 
in  two  installments  in  the  Dollar  Newspaper  on  June  21  and  28,  1843.  It  made 
an  instant  hit.  So  great  was  the  demand  that  it  was  reprinted  in  the  Saturday 
Courier,  and  then  reprinted  again  in  the  Dollar  Newspaper . Playwright  Silas 
S.  Steele  adapted  it,  and  on  August  8 it  was  given  as  a curtain  raiser  at  the 
Walnut  Street  Theatre  in  Philadelphia.  The  tale  was — and  is — by  far  the  most 
popular  of  any  of  Poe’s  stories.  In  1845,  it  was  published  in  book  form  for  the 
first  time,  in  Tales.  Poe  revised  the  plaintext  slightly— changing  a forty  to  a 
twenty — and  corrected  the  ciphertext  to  agree;  but,  human  as  he  was,  he 
forgot  to  make  the  appropriate  changes  in  his  frequency  count.  The  Tales 
count  also  omits  one  character,  the  ( representing  r.  Most  editors  have  re- 
produced these  slightly  erroneous  figures.  In  November  of  1845,  a French 
translation  by  Alphonse  Borghers  appeared  in  La  revue  britannique,  and  in 
1856  the  great  French  symbolist  poet  whom  Poe  had  so  influenced  and  who 
in  turn  influenced  so  much  of  French  poetry,  Charles  Baudelaire,  published 
his  translation  as  “Le  Scarabee  d’or.”  “The  Gold-Bug”  was  both  the  climax 
and  the  conclusion  of  Poe’s  cryptologic  writings;  he  published  nothing  more 
on  the  subject,  although  he  solved  cryptograms  sent  him  by  correspondents 
during  the  next  two  years.  He  eventually  stopped  this,  complaining  in  a letter 
to  a friend  that  “I  have  lost,  in  time,  which  to  me  is  money,  more  than  a 
thousand  dollars,  in  solving  ciphers.” 

“The  Gold-Bug”  opens  with  the  hero,  William  Legrand,  living  a secluded 
life  on  Sullivan’s  Island  with  an  old  Negro  servant,  Jupiter.  A sort  of  amateur 
naturalist,  Legrand  has  found  a new  specimen,  a gold-colored  bug;  he 
sketches  it  for  his  friend,  the  first-person  narrator  of  the  story,  upon  a scrap 
of  parchment  that  he  has  picked  up  on  the  beach.  The  narrator  accidentally 
holds  the  parchment  near  a fire.  When  he  looks  at  it,  he  sees  only  a reddish 
death’s-head.  Legrand  becomes  abstracted  upon  seeing  this.  During  the  next 
month  or  so  his  behavior  becomes  increasingly  strange.  Jupiter  fetches  the 
narrator,  and  upon  Legrand’s  request  they  set  off  into  the  woods,  carrying 
shovels.  Halting  at  a large  tree,  Legrand  makes  Jupiter  climb  it,  find  a skull  at 
the  end  of  a branch,  and  drop  the  gold-bug  (which  Legrand  has  gotten  back 
from  the  friend  to  whom  he  lent  it)  through  one  eye.  Following  a line  deter- 
mined by  the  bug  and  the  tree,  they  dig — and  exhume  a fabulous  treasure  of 
glittering  gold  coins  and  jewels,  buried  there  by  Kidd.  The  mystery  of  how 
Legrand  knew  how  to  find  it  is  resolved  when  he  explains  how,  using  heat,  he 
developed  a cryptogram  in  invisible  ink  on  the  parchment,  and  then  (using 
the  frequency  count  that  Poe  had  copied  out  of  the  Blair  article)  how  he 
solved  the  cryptogram. 

The  story  is  full  of  absurdities  and  errors.  The  parchment  was  found  near 
“the  remnants  of  the  hull  of  what  appeared  to  have  been  a ship’s  long  boat,” 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  '"1 

which  “seemed  to  have  been  there  for  a very  great  while;  for  the  resemblance 
to  boat  timbers  could  scarcely  be  traced.”  This  was  the  boat  in  which  Kidd 
had  brought  ashore  his  treasure.  Would  the  parchment  have  remained  in  the 
same  place  for  generations?  If  it  did,  would  it  not  have  suffered  from  the 
elements,  as  the  timbers  did?  The  invisible  ink,  Poe  specifies,  is  “regulus  of 
cobalt,  dissolved  in  spirit  of  nitre.”  Unfortunately,  this  gives  cobalt  nitrate, 
which  is  readily  soluble  in  water.  Would  any  trace  of  ink  have  remained  on 
the  parchment  after  decades  on  the  beach?  Even  if  any  had,  it  would  have 
been  obliterated  when  Legrand  washed  the  parchment  in  warm  water  to 
remove  dirt.  Legrand  spotted  the  skull  from  a hillside  seat  through  a rift  in 
the  trees;  as  soon  as  he  moved  from  the  seat,  the  skull  disappeared.  Poe 
implies  that  for  that  very  reason  the  pirates  chose  that  seat,  that  tree,  and 
that  branch.  Would  that  narrow  rift  have  remained  unchanged  through  150 
years  of  arboreal  growth?  The  first  traces  of  the  ink  were  accidentally 
brought  out  when  the  narrator’s  hand,  holding  the  parchment,  dropped  close 
to  a fire;  but  heat  strong  enough  to  bring  out  the  ink  would  probably  have 
scorched  the  narrator’s  hand.  The  frequency  table  was  of  course  absurd, 
though  Poe  paid  no  attention  whatever  to  it  after  using  it  to  identify  e. 
Finally,  one  may  wonder  whether  Kidd  would  have  employed  so  ridiculously 
melodramatic  a manner  of  recording  the  treasure  location,  and  have  been  so 
careless  as  to  lose  the  note. 

All  of  these  criticisms  are  valid.  They  show  that  Poe  was  less  concerned 
with  accuracy  than  with  the  appearance  of  accuracy,  that  he  affected  a learn- 
ing which  he  did  not  have  and  to  this  extent  was  not  intellectually  honest. 
Beyond  that,  and  to  the  reader,  none  of  them  matters.  For  no  one  thinks  of 
these  problems  when  caught  up  in  the  powerful  narrative  current  of  the  story. 
The  tale  perhaps  owes  some  of  its  force  to  Poe’s  using  it  to  vent  some  of  his 
frustrated  desires.  “I  cannot  keep  from  thinking  with  sadness  how  the 
unfortunate  E.  Poe  must  have  dreamed  more  than  once  about  how  to  dis- 
cover such  treasures,”  wrote  Baudelaire.  The  plot,  with  its  finding  of  buried 
treasure,  may  seem  trite  to  readers  of  today.  But  that  is  for  the  same  reason 
that  Hamlet  seems  loaded  with  cliches:  its  virtues  have  made  its  lines  so  well 
known.  Something  of  how  it  struck  contemporaries,  however,  may  be  felt 
in  what  Baudelaire  wrote:  “How  beautiful  is  the  description  of  the  treasure, 
and  how  good  a feeling  of  warmth  and  dazzlement  one  gets  from  it!  For  they 
find  the  treasure!  it  is  not  a dream,  as  generally  happens  in  all  these  novels, 
where  the  author  awakens  us  brutally  after  having  excited  our  minds  with 
appetizing  hopes;  this  time,  it  is  a real  treasure,  and  the  decipherer  has  really 
won  it.”  The  construction  of  the  story,  which  ends,  not  with  the  finding  of  the 
treasure,  as  lesser  writers  might  have  done,  but  with  the  resolution  of  the 
cryptogram,  is  exactly  right.  Moreover,  the  exposition  of  that  crucial  part  of 
the  story,  on  which  all  turns,  is  a masterpiece  of  lucidity.  “As  we  follow  the 
steps  of  the  argument,”  wrote  critic  Wimsatt,  “we  have  the  impression  of 
intricacy  and  precision,  of  Legrand’s  shrewdness  and  patience — each  detail

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


receives  attention — and  yet  we  are  never  lost,  the  main  outlines  remain  clear, 
the  reasoning  turns  where  it  should,  the  momentum,  or  rhythm  of  the  whole  is 
sustained.  The  writing  of  this  kind  of  prose  was,  as  1 see  it,  one  of  Poe’s  most 
impressive  gifts.” 

The  story’s  excellence  wells  up  from  deeper  springs,  however.  The  reader 
watches  fascinatedly  as  a chain  of  logic  appears  link  by  link  and  ends  in  the 
disclosure  of  the  answer  to  the  central  problem.  “The  Gold-Bug”  and  one  or 
two  of  Poe’s  other  stories  are  the  first  to  employ  this  intellectual  operation  as 
their  theme,  and  so  they  are  called  the  first  detective  stories.  But  “The  Gold- 
Bug”  has  something  that  other  detective  stories  do  not.  All  mystery  stories 
give  the  reader,  who  identifies  with  the  hero,  the  mental  satisfaction  of  resolv- 
ing a puzzle.  Beyond  that,  the  reader  gets  nothing  out  of  it,  for  in  most  cases 
the  conclusion  reaches  out  to  a third  party — it  merely  punishes  the  murderer. 
“The  Gold-Bug,”  however,  rewards  the  hero-reader.  Unlike  other  detective 
fiction,  “The  Gold-Bug”  purges,  in  an  Aristotelian  sense,  man’s  craving  for 
wealth  and  power.  The  story  satisfies  the  emotions.  It  adds  that  extra  dimen- 
sion to  the  intellectual  one.  In  that  may  lie  the  story’s  special  merit,  its 
perennially  engaging  quality,  while  the  breadth  of  its  appeal  may  lie  in  the 
universality  of  the  desire  it  brings  to  catharsis. 

At  the  same  time,  the  cryptological  element  in  “The  Gold-Bug”  exists  on 
the  same  two  levels:  the  levels  of  reason  and  desire  that  summoned  up  so 
intense  a response  in  Poe.  On  the  surface,  the  story  deals  only  with  the 
scientific  aspect  of  cryptology:  the  text  handles  it  strictly  as  a subject  for 
“ratiocination,”  for  logical  investigation.  But  the  structure  of  the  story 
utilizes  cryptology  as  a form  of  divination.  The  mysterious  symbols  of  the 
message  contain  the  secrets  of  great  wealth,  and  the  man  who  reads  them 
compels  the  earth  to  yield  up  these  hidden  treasures.  These  are  precisely  the 
operations  of  divination  and  magic,  which  seek  to  fulfill  human  desires  by 
foretelling  and  so  controlling  nature,  and  these  are  the  operations  that  the 
plot  executes  and  so  confirms.  On  this  deeper,  almost  subliminal  level,  then, 
Poe  set  up  anew  a sympathetic  vibration  between  cryptology  and  magic.  Poe, 
in  other  words,  glamorized  cryptology. 

The  effect  was  to  popularize  it.  He  was  the  first  to  do  so.  The  immense 
success  of  his  story  gave  far  wider  currency  to  valid  information  about 
cryptology  than  any  mere  textbook  could  have  given.  "Popular  interest  in 
this  country  in  the  subject  of  cryptography  received  its  first  stimulus  from 
Edgar  Allan  Poe,”  wrote  Friedman.  Interest  extended  to  England,  where  the 
mathematician  Charles  Lutwidge  Dodgson,  better  known  as  the  writer  Lewis 
Carroll,  copied  Poe's  table  of  letter  frequencies  into  a notebook,  along  with  a 
few  other  cryptologic  odds  and  ends.  “The  Gold-Bug”  was  the  first  widely 
available  and  easily  palatable  lesson  on  the  subject,  and  it  continues  as  such. 
People  still  read  it,  learn  from  it — and  are  inspired  by  it.  The  contributions  of 
those  thereby  attracted  to  cryptology  probably  cannot  be  measured,  but 
whether  they  be  few  or  many,  cryptology  owes  them  to  Poe. 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  793 

It  also  owes  him  much  of  its  literature.  Since  Poe  showed  the  way,  other 
writers  have  used  secret  writing  in  their  stories.  And  not  a few  of  their  tales 
would  be  more  honestly  entitled  “Return  of  the  Gold-Bug"  or  “Son  of  Gold- 
Bug,”  since  they  utilize  the  same  hidden-treasure  motif.  (It  is  in  reading  many 
of  these  stories  and  then  rereading  “The  Gold-Bug”  that  Poe’s  genius  be- 
comes apparent.)  Their  cryptologic  episodes  are  often  well  done,  however, 
and  the  quality  of  the  writer  often  shows  itself  in  the  way  he  handles  the 
cryptology.  The  ciphers  may  be  more  plausible,  the  exposition  of  their  solu- 
tion clearer,  their  connection  with  the  plot — where  they  are  not  merely  a 
flourish — more  intimate.  Nearly  always  the  ciphers  are  simple  ones,  for  to 
explain  or  solve  a complicated  one  slows  the  narrative  pace  too  drastically 
and  involves  more  explanation  than  the  reader  of  fiction  will  put  up  with. 
Sometimes,  of  course,  the  author  himself  does  not  know  enough  to  write 
effectively  about  the  subject. 

The  number  of  well-known  authors  who  have  touched  upon  cryptology 
in  their  works  is  surprising.  William  Makepeace  Thackeray,  the  six-foot  four- 
inch  author  of  Vanity  Fair,  employed  a Cardano  grille  in  1852  in  The  History 
of  Henry  Esmond,  the  novel  that  has  been  called  his  most  artistic  and  for 
which  he  did  months  of  research  in  the  British  Museum.  The  cipher  was  used 
in  the  book’s  account  of  the  plot  to  put  the  would-be  James  III  on  England’s 
throne— the  same  plot  in  which  Bishop  Atterbury  was  convicted,  largely  on 
cryptanalyzed  evidence.  No  cryptanalysis  was  involved  here,  though,  simply 
the  transmission  of  a message. 

Jules  Verne  heightened  the  excitement  of  three  of  his  novels  with  the 
mystery  of  secret  writing.  In  general,  he  handled  cryptology  as  well  as  he  did 
other  technical  matters.  But  he  marred  his  two  solutions  with  a physical  or  a 
psychological  improbability.  These  hurt  the  credibility  of  his  cryptanalyses 
more  than  the  technological  improbabilities  injured  the  credibility  of  his 
science-fiction  fantasies,  because  they  violated  immutable  laws  of  nature 
whereas  the  fantasies  merely  exceeded  man’s  then-current  technical  capabili- 
ties. On  the  other  hand,  just  as  he  foresaw  submarines,  projectiles  from  the 
earth  to  the  moon,  and  speedy  trips  around  the  world,  so  Verne  anticipated  a 
technique  of  cryptanalysis. 

He  began  the  book  that  was  his  second  great  success  and  that  clinched  his 
reputation.  Voyage  to  the  Center  of  the  Earth,  with  a three-step  cryptogram.  On 
a slip  of  parchment,  it  flutters  out  of  an  old  runic  manuscript  that  Professor 
Otto  Lidenbrock  has  just  bought.  It  too  is  in  runic — 21  groups  of  six  characters 
each.  Lidenbrock  converts  it  into  roman  letters;  it  makes  no  sense,  so  he  re- 
arranges the  letters  in  the  form  of  a columnar  transposition,  then  transcribes 
them.  Still  no  luck.  Later,  his  young  nephew,  Axel,  “mechanically”  fanning 
himself  with  the  paper  bearing  the  transcription,  sees  the  writing  through  its 
back  and  discovers  that  it  is  simply  a Latin  text  written  in  reverse.  Here  the 
plausibility  slips  a little  on  several  counts:  Can  one  read  through  paper  so 
easily?  Would  Axel  have  been  able  to  grasp  the  significance  of  the  letters, 


794 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


which  would  appear  backward?  Probably  not.  But  all  is  forgotten  in  the 
excitement  of  reading  the  plaintext:  “Descend  the  crater  of  the  volcano  of 
Snelfels  when  the  shadow  of  [Mount]  Scartaris  comes  to  caress  it  before  the 
calends  of  July,  audacious  voyager,  and  you  will  reach  the  center  of  the  earth. 
I have  done  it.  Arne  Saknussemm.”  And  Lidenbrock  and  Axel,  following  the 
cryptanalyzed  instructions,  do  it  too. 

In  La  Jangada,  Judge  Jarriquez,  after  failing  to  solve  a cryptogram  as  an 
ordinary  monalphabetic,  concludes  that  it  is  a Gronsfeld  (a  Vigenere  with 
numerical  key)  because  it  contains  a group  of  three  repeated  letters.  This 
induction  is  poorly  founded — many  ciphers  produce  three  of  the  same  letters 
in  a row — and  is  the  flaw  in  the  solution.  A Gronsfeld  it  is,  however,  and 
Jarriquez  solves  it  by  trying,  on  the  basis  of  outside  information,  the  name 
Ortega  as  the  probable  word  that  ends  the  message  as  a signature.  He  sees  at 
once  that  the  six  final  letters,  suvjhd,  all  stand  farther  back  in  the  alphabet 
than  the  letters  of  Ortega,  which  supports  his  hypothesis.  Jarriquez  uses  the 
probable  word  to  recover  the  key  432513  and  then  tests  it  at  the  beginning  of 
the  cryptogram.  He  gets  a lucky  break  when  the  one  chance  in  six  that  the 
key  begins  with  the  4 works  out,  and  he  reads  the  plaintext  right  off.  Though 
this  rather  obvious  technique  may  well  have  been  used  before,  Verne’s 
exposition  of  it  here  in  1881  is  the  first  to  appear  in  print,  and  it  may  even  be 
regarded  as  the  forerunner  of  the  identical  method  of  using  a probable  word  to 
recover  a polyalphabetic  key  that  Bazeries  published  twenty  years  later  with 
the  boastful  cry  that  it  was  “a  new  procedure  of  decipherment  which  neither 
Kasiski,  nor  Kerckhoffs,  nor  Josse,  nor  Viaris,  nor  Valerio  have  described!” 

Verne’s  final  fictionalization  of  cryptology,  in  Mathias  Sandorff,  involved 
no  solution,  since  Sarcany  finds  the  grille  that  enciphered  the  message.  In  this 
book,  published  in  1885,  Verne  cited  Eduard  Fleissner  von  Wostrowitz’s 
Handbuch  der  Kryptographie,  published  four  years  earlier,  which  eulogizes 
grilles.  Verne  probably  also  read  Kerckhoffs’  La  Cryptographie  militaire, 
published  two  years  before  Mathias  Sandorff,  since  Verne’s  language  in 
discussing  the  requirements  of  good  ciphers  is  strongly  reminiscent  of 
Kerckhoffs’.  He  did  not  absorb  all  Kerckhoffs’  information,  however,  since 
he  proclaimed  the  grille  and  enciphered  code  as  unbreakable. 

The  most  famous  of  fictional  detectives,  Sherlock  Holmes,  encountered 
ciphers  not  once  but  three  times  in  his  distinguished  career  (excluding  a 
simple  signaling  system  of  light  flashes  and  a word  puzzle).  In  “The  ‘Gloria 
Scott,’  ” the  great  detective  soon  discovers  that  a secret  message  is  hidden 
within  an  open-code  text  as  every  third  word.  In  “The  Valley  of  Fear,”  given 
a numerical  code  message  from  an  accomplice  of  his  arch  rival.  Professor 
Moriarty,  he  reasons  his  way  brilliantly  not  only  to  the  conclusion  that  it  is  a 
book  code,  but  to  the  very  volume  used.  The  book  must  be  both  readily 
available  and  standardized  as  to  format.  This  excludes  the  Bible,  which  meets 
the  requirement  of  availability  to  perfection  but  that  of  standardization  of 
pages  not  at  all — and  also  because  “I  could  hardly  name  any  volume  which 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  795 

would  be  less  likely  to  lie  at  the  elbow  of  one  of  Moriarty’s  associates.”  The 
only  volume  which  fits  both  requirements  is  Whitaker's  Almanac.  The  current 
edition  yields  the  senseless  Mahratta  government  pig's  bristles,  but  last  year's 
gives  perfect  sense.  Thus  Holmes  solves  the  cryptogram  purely  by  use  of  his 
famed  deductive  powers  and  without  really  needing  to  know  cryptanalysis. 

But  his  thorough  knowledge  of  that  subject,  as  of  all  others  needed  in  his 
chosen  profession,  becomes  manifest  in  his  “Adventure  of  the  Dancing 
Men.”  The  dancing  men — little  stick  figures  with  their  arms  and  legs  in 
various  positions — constitute  the  cipher  symbols.  An  American  gangster, 
Abe  Slaney,  “the  most  dangerous  crook  in  Chicago,”  writes  threatening  notes 
in  them  to  a former  childhood  sweetheart,  Elsie,  who  has  married  an  English 
squire.  The  squire  copies  the  messages,  which  are  chalked  on  window  sills 
and  tool  houses,  and  brings  them  to  Holmes.  Holmes  solves  them,  but  the 
squire  is  killed  by  Slaney  in  an  exchange  of  shots  before  Holmes  can  prevent 
the  tragedy.  Slaney  escapes.  Holmes,  who  knows  where  he  is  from  the  solved 


A message  in  the  Dancing  Men  cipher,  solved  by  Sherlock  Holmes 


cryptograms,  carefully  composes  a message  out  of  cipher  symbols  that  he  has 
recovered  and  sends  him  a note  urging  him  to  Come  here  at  once.  (Holmes 
perhaps  borrowed  this  scheme  from  Thomas  Phelippes,  who,  Holmes  knew, 
had  in  1587  forged  a cipher  postscript  to  a letter  of  Mary,  Queen  of  Scots,  to 
learn  the  names  of  the  intended  murderers  in  the  Babington  plot  against 
Elizabeth.)  Slaney,  naively  believing  that  only  Elsie  and  others  of  his  Chicago 
gang  at  the  Joint  could  read  the  cipher  and  that  the  note  must  therefore  have 
come  from  her,  returns  to  the  squire's  home.  He  is  at  once  arrested  and, 
naturally,  confesses. 

Holmes  is,  as  he  himself  says,  “fairly  familiar  with  all  forms  of  secret 
writings,  and  am  myself  the  author  of  a trifling  monograph  upon  the  subject, 
in  which  1 analyse  one  hundred  and  sixty  separate  ciphers,  but  I confess  that 
this  is  entirely  new  to  me.”  He  referred,  of  course,  to  the  use  of  the  dancers  “to 
give  the  idea  that  they  are  the  mere  random  sketches  of  children,”  and  not  to 
their  nature  as  a monalphabetic  substitution.  That  he  promptly  recognized 
that  they  belonged  to  this  class  of  ciphers  is  proved  by  his  embarking  at  once 
upon  a solution  without  any  false  starts.  His  task  was  considerably  more 
difficult  than  that  of  any  other  fictional  cryptanalyst,  because  his  text  was 
exceedingly  short,  disconnected,  and  elliptical  and  loaded  with  proper  names. 
It  eventually  consisted  of  five  messages  in  telegraphic  English:  (1)  Am  here 
Abe  Slaney,  (2)  At  Elriges,  (3)  Come  Elsie,  (4)  Never,  (5)  Elsie  prepare  to  meet

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


thy  God.  But  to  begin  with  Holmes  had  only  the  first  message,  on  which  he 
made  his  start,  and  he  broke  the  cipher  only  with  that  message  plus  the  next 
three.  They  total  only  38  letters,  eight  of  them  occurring  but  once;  out  of  the 
nine  words,  four  are  proper  names,  and  of  the  other  five  none  is  among  the 
ten  most  frequent  words  in  English,  which  normally  make  up  a quarter  of 
English  text. 

The  difficulty  of  such  a solution  demonstrates  the  power  and  flexibility  of 
the  great  detective’s  mind.  Holmes  would  quite  evidently  have  preferred  to 
solve  the  cryptogram  with  his  usual  rigorous  deductions,  which  means  by 
frequency  analysis.  He  began  that  way.  The  first  message  contained  15 
dancing  men,  of  which  four  are  in  an  ecstatic  spread-eagle  position  and  three 
have  their  left  leg  bent.  Holmes  at  once  marked  down  the  four  spread-eagle 
dancers  as  e.  Now,  neither  letter  frequencies  nor  any  other  statistical  pheno- 
mena are  reliable  in  small  samples;  it  was  quite  possible  that  the  three  bent- 
left-leg  dancers  represented  e,  or  that  one  of  the  single  dancers  did,  or  even 
that  no  e at  all  occurred  in  the  first  message.  It  is  inconceivable  that  Holmes 
did  not  know  this.  Nevertheless,  he  fixed  the  symbol  for  e “with  some 
confidence.”  He  was  right,  of  course,  but  why?  No  doubt  Holmes,  having 
recognized  that  the  figures  holding  flags  marked  the  ends  of  words,  noticed 
that  two  of  the  four  spread-eagle  dancers  carried  flags,  and  instantly  con- 
nected this  with  the  well-known  fact  that  e is  the  most  frequent  terminal  letter 
in  English.  His  swift  mind  may  also  have  observed  the  variety  of  the  e 
dancers’  contacts.  But  all  this  flashed  through  his  great  brain  just  below  the 
threshold  of  his  consciousness — this  perhaps  helps  explain  the  characteristic 
rapidity  of  his  deductions — and  consequently  he  did  not  articulate  it  in  his 
explanation  to  Watson.  Or  perhaps  he  did  not  want  to  burden  Watson  with 
all  those  details. 

He  did  realize,  however,  that  neither  frequency  analysis  nor  anything  else 
could  go  further  in  the  first  message,  and  so  he  awaited  more  text.  Upon  the 
arrival  of  the  next  three  messages,  he  saw  that  frequency  analysis  would  not 
serve  with  so  short  a text.  Unable  to  progress  with  his  beloved  deductions,  he 
deftly  switched  to  induction.  He  performed  brilliantly,  guessing  first  that  a 
five-letter  word  with  e as  the  second  and  fourth  letters  and  comprising  a 
message  in  itself  must  be  never,  and  then  conjecturing  that  the  name  Elsie 
might  occur  in  the  messages  and  finding  it.  With  these  values  he  was  fairly  on 
his  way,  and  with  further  arduous  labor  completed  the  solution. 

Some  cryptologists  have  affected  to  sneer  at  Holmes’s  taking  two  hours  to 
solve  these  cryptograms,  covering  “sheet  after  sheet  of  paper  with  figures  and 
letters”  as  he  did  so.  With  so  short  and  difficult  a text,  however,  the  time  is 
not  only  understandable,  but  admirable.  Moreover,  the  dancers  caper  in  no 
recognizable  pattern  when  placed  in  alphabetical  order,  and  when  they  pose 
in  a graduated  order  of  choreography,  no  regularity  appears  in  the  letters.  In 
other  words,  the  cipher  of  the  dancing  man  is  purely  arbitrary.  Some  members 
of  the  Sherlock  Holmes  fan  club,  the  Baker  Street  Irregulars,  which  included 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  797 

Alexander  Woollcott,  Christopher  Morley,  and  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt,  have 
kept  their  gaslights  burning  late  in  attempts  to  discover  a regular  basis  of 
construction.  It  is  wasted  energy.  The  fact  that  Holmes  limited  himself  to 
already  recovered  letters  in  his  “Come  here  at  once”  message  to  Slaney 
suggests  that  he  did  not  discover  any  regularity  which  would  have  permitted 
him  slightly  more  latitude  in  composing  that  message.  And  surely  had  there 
been  such  a key  pattern,  Holmes  would  have  discovered  it.  The  inventor  of  the 
cipher,  Elsie’s  father,  Patrick,  “the  boss  of  the  Joint,”  may  have  gotten  the 
idea  for  the  dancing  men  from  a cipher  based  on  human  figures  in  the  semi- 
official Manual  of  Signals  by  Albert  Myers,  the  founder  of  the  U.S.  Army 
Signal  Corps,  or  from  the  same  unknown  place  as  the  inventor  of  a slightly 
later  United  States  patent  that  uses  manikins  for  cipher  symbols,  or  from  the 
ubiquitous  Carbonari,  whose  call-sign  is  made  by  extending  the  arms  hori- 
zontally in  the  form  of  a cross  and  the  reply  by  pressing  two  fists  one  above 
the  other  on  the  breast.  Holmes  may  well  have  known  of  these  possible 
sources.  But  even  if  Patrick  did  borrow  the  idea  from  one  of  them,  he  has 
altered  the  arrangement  so  thoroughly  that  cryptanalysis  is  left  as  the  only 
way  of  resolving  the  problem. 

A final  point  remains  to  be  cleared  up  in  the  case  of  the  dancing  men:  the 
source  of  the  cryptographic  errors  that  appear  in  all  printed  accounts.  In  the 
very  first  publication  of  “The  Adventure  of  the  Dancing  Men,”  the  crypto- 
grams use  the  same  dancer  for  the  v in  Never  and  the  p's  in  prepare,  and  use 
an  identical  dancer  for  the  b in  Abe  and  for  the  r in  Never.  The  Baker  Street 
Irregulars  have  expended  a great  deal  of  energy  on  this  problem.  It  is  in  their 
attempts  to  find  the  “correct"  version  that  they  have  falsely  assumed  a 
regularity  in  the  cipher  alphabet,  constructing  tables  of  arm  and  leg  positions 
and  extrapolating  the  ciphertext  symbols  for  the  eight  letters  ( f j , k,  q,  u,  w, 
x,  z)  that  do  not  occur  in  the  messages.  They  have  also  sought  to  determine 
the  cause  of  the  errors.  Their  efforts,  however,  have  served  only  to  show  why 
they  are  the  disciples  and  Holmes  the  master.  All  of  them  engage  in  armchair 
thinking  without  investigating  the  facts.  There  has  been  a suggestion  that  the 
errors  “are  in  the  messages  of  the  villain  of  the  story  and  may  be  laid,  if  one 
so  wishes,  to  the  poor  devil's  confusion  and  despair,”  but  no  one  has  raised 
the  equally  likely  possibility  that  the  squire  may  have  made  the  mistakes  while 
copying  the  messages  to  bring  them  to  Holmes.  In  fact,  however,  the  errors 
are  neither  Slaney’s  nor  the  squire’s,  for  the  errors  were  not  present  when 
Holmes  solved  the  cryptograms.  If  the  same  symbol  had  been  used  for  v and 
p in  the  originals.  Holmes  would  have  produced  the  partial  plaintext  vrevare 
in  the  fifth  message  after  guessing  Never  instead  of  the  ?re?are  that  he  shows, 
with  the  two  p's  as  unknowns.  Similarly,  if  the  r and  b had  been  confounded  in 
the  original,  he  would  have  shown  a partial  solution  /re  (for  the  correct  Abe) 
after  guessing  Never,  but  in  fact  he  shows  a partial  solution  ??e  with  the  b 
still  unknown.  Holmes’  own  account  thus  proves  that  the  errors  did  not 
exist  in  the  original  messages — and  it  is  fortunate  that  they  did  not,  for  they 


798 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


occur  at  junctures  crucial  to  the  analysis  and,  coupled  with  the  other  diffi- 
culties, might  have  rendered  the  cryptograms  almost  impossible  to  read,  even 
for  Holmes.  The  errors  must  therefore  have  been  made  by  Dr.  Watson  in 
transmitting  the  canon  to  the  world.  Later  publications  have  compounded 
Watson’s  original  errors,  but  these  have  passed  through  the  hands  of  literary 
and  journalistic  types,  notoriously  frivolous  and  unreliable  as  to  facts,  and 
need  not  be  considered. 

After  Holmes’  feat,  all  other  solutions  look  pale.  Westrell  Keen,  the 
Tracer  of  Lost  Persons,  an  elderly,  distinguished-looking,  unfailingly  court- 
eous man,  conceived  by  Robert  W.  Chambers,  is  given  a cipher  consisting  of 
rectangles  with  crossing  diagonals,  some  of  the  lines  of  which  are  crossed  by 
ticks.  Like  every  fictional  cryptanalyst,  Keen  must  set  forth  superexcellent 
credentials  and  then  marvel  at  the  surprising  uniqueness  of  the  present  system. 
Keen’s  statement  is  classic : 

“It’s  the  strangest  cipher  I ever  encountered,”  said  Mr.  Keen — “the  strangest  I 
ever  heard  of.  I have  seen  hundreds  of  ciphers — hundreds — secret  codes  of  the 
State  Department,  secret  military  codes,  elaborate  Oriental  ciphers,  symbols 
used  in  commercial  transactions,  symbols  used  by  criminals  and  every  species  of 
malefactor.  And  every  one  of  them  can  be  solved  with  time  and  patience  and  a 
little  knowledge  of  the  subject.  But  this”— he  sat  looking  at  it  with  eyes  half 
closed — “this  is  too  simple.” 

Notwithstanding,  he  solves  it  in  short  order,  finding  that  the  ticks  mark  the 
lines  that  in  each  rectangle  form  a crude  drawing  of  a number.  These  numbers 
serve  as  the  cipher  message  in  a system  where  1 = a,  2 = b,  and  so  on.  The 
message,  directed  at  handsome  Captain  Kenneth  Harren  of  the  Philippine 
Scouts,  reads,  I never  saw  you  but  once.  I love  you.  Edith  Inwood.  Keen 
discovers  from  his  voluminous  files  that  Miss  Inwood,  24,  a 1902  graduate  of 
Barnard,  is  an  assistant  to  Professor  Boggs  of  the  American  Museum  of 
Inscriptions  and  an  authority  on  Arabian  cryptograms.  Keen  unites  the 
lovers. 

H.  Rider  Haggard,  author  of  She  and  King  Solomon  s Mines,  had  the 
eponymous  hero  of  his  Colonel  Quaritch,  Q.  V.,  poor,  plain,  and  middle-aged, 
solve  a cipher  that  enabled  him  to  find  a buried  treasure  and  marry  the  young 
woman  who  loved  him.  This  saved  her  “from  a fate  sore  as  death,”  namely, 
marrying  a young,  rich,  and  handsome  man  whom — alas! — she  did  not  love. 
The  solution  of  the  cipher,  a null  system,  must  rank  among  the  strangest  in 
fiction:  “Now,  as  the  match  burnt  up,  connected  probably  with  the  darkness 
and  the  sudden  striking  of  light  upon  his  eyeballs,  it  came  to  pass  that  Harold 
[Quaritch].  happening  to  glance  thereon,  was  only  able  to  read  four  letters 
of  this  first  line  of  writing  of  the  cryptogram.  All  the  rest  seemed  to  him  but 
as  a blur  connecting  those  four  letters.  They  were:  D.  ...  e ....  a ....  d, 
being  respectively  the  initial  letters  of  the  first,  the  sixth,  the  eleventh,  and 
the  sixteenth  words  of  the  line  given  above.”  It  is  a cryptanalysis  by  optical 


Heterogeneous  Impulses  '99 

illusion.  Interestingly,  a niece  and  a nephew  of  Haggard  later  served  in 
England’s  Room  40.  Perhaps  if  Haggard  had  written  the  book  after  their 
experience  there,  his  solution  might  have  been  a little  less  farfetched.

O.  Henry  penned  a sardonically  amusing  story  about  “Calloway’s  Code.” 
Calloway,  a newspaper  correspondent,  gets  a scoop  past  the  censor’s  eye  by 
using  the  first  half  of  a newspaper  cliche  as  the  codeword  for  the  second  half, 
which  forms  the  plaintext.  Thus,  foregone  meant  conclusion;  dark,  horse; 
brute,  force ; beggars,  description.  And — sad  to  say — the  journalists  in  New 
York  understand  it.  Robert  Graves  gave  the  ancient  Romans  two  ciphers, 
an  ordinary  (the  Caesar)  and  a special  (a  polyalphabetic),  in  /,  Claudius. 
India’s  great  Rabindranath  Tagore  recorded  the  directions  to  a secret  treasure 
in  gudhalekhya,  a classical  Indian  system  of  cryptography,  in  his  story 
“Gupta-dhana”  (“The  Hidden  Treasure”). 

But  most  cryptograms  appear  in  mystery  stories.  Bram  Stoker,  the  author 
of  Dracula,  based  The  Mystery  of  the  Sea  upon  an  enormously  complicated 
concealment  system;  the  book,  like  Byrne’s  Silent  Years,  may  have  been 
written  partly  to  show  off  the  method.  The  solution  leads  to  a fabulous 
treasure.  Agatha  Christie,  one  of  the  most  artistic  of  mystery  writers,  em- 
ployed an  open  code  using  flower  names  in  “The  Four  Suspects,”  solved,  of 
course,  by  her  prim  Aunt  Jane  Marple.  E.  C.  Bentley,  author  of  Trent  s Last 
Case,  has  his  Philip  Trent  likewise  tangle  with  an  open-code  flower  system  in 
“The  Ministering  Angel.”  Lillian  de  la  Torre  has  her  Dr.  Samuel  Johnson 
solve  a skytale  cipher  that  used  a peg  leg  as  the  skytale  in  “The  Stolen 
Christmas  Box.”  In  Montague  Rhodes  Hames'  ghost  story  “The  Treasure  of 
Abbot  Thomas,”  a solution  leads  to  a treasure.  And  there  have  been  scores  of 
others — sometimes  in  short  stories,  sometimes  as  decoration  for  the  major 
plot  in  books.  Even  Fu  Manchu  thrust  The  Hand  of  Fu  Manchu  into  crypto- 
logy. The  cryptograms  have  been  of  all  kinds,  based  on  everything  from  the 
Dewey  Decimal  classification  system  used  in  libraries  to  the  roulette  wheel. 

They  have  grown  more  complicated  as  readers  have  grown  more  sophisti- 
cated. In  1932,  Dorothy  Sayers’  urbane  Lord  Peter  Wimsey  solved  a 
Playfair  in  Have  His  Carcase — and  quite  an  elegant  solution  it  is,  too.  Un- 
doubtedly the  most  complex  cryptogram  ever  to  appear  in  novel  form  is  the 
mixed-alphabet  polyalphabetic  in  Helen  McCloy’s  Panic,  published  in  1944, 
when  interest  in  cryptology  was  high.  The  author  displays  a fair  knowledge  of 
cryptology  and  its  literature,  listing  some  of  the  standard  works  in  describing 
the  contents  of  her  cryptologist  victim's  bookshelves.  The  cryptologist’s  niece 
solves  the  cipher  somewhat  intuitively,  though  with  a fair  amount  of  analysis,

and  the  solution  leads  to  the  killer.  In  1957,  Ian  Fleming  gave  his  hero,  James 
Bond,  the  task  of  capturing  the  cipher  machine  Spektor,  whose  workings 
were,  unfortunately,  not  described ; the  book,  From  Russia,  With  Love,  was  one 
of  the  favorites  of  President  John  Kennedy. 

Cryptology  has  insinuated  itself  into  motion  pictures  as  well.  In  Dis- 
honored, Marlene  Dietrich  rolled  out  a few  magnificent  chords  in  which  was 
supposed  to  be  concealed  some  secret  message  with  the  notes  representing 
letters.  During  the  1930s,  when  Saturday  afternoon  movie  serials  were  so 
popular,  Paul  Kelly  starred  in  a 15-part  thriller  entitled  The  Secret  Code, 
which  had  very  little  to  do  with  cryptology  but  displayed  an  awful  lot  of 
cliff-hanging  action.  Rendezvous,  the  film  based  on  Yardley’s  The  Blonde 
Countess,  of  course  had  a touch  of  cryptology,  as  did  the  film  version  of 
From  Russia,  With  Love,  which  flashed  the  Spektor — which  resembled  no 
cipher  machine  in  existence — upon  the  screen  for  the  briefest  moment.  The 
wartime  documentary  The  House  on  92nd  Street  had  a brief  scene  showing 
German  spies  being  instructed  in  cryptography  at  a Hamburg  spy  school, 
complete  with  a Vigenere-like  tableau. 

Cryptology  played  a big  role  during  daytime  radio  serials  in  the  late  1930s 
and  early  1940s,  before  television.  Such  favorites  as  Captain  Midnight  and 
Little  Orphan  Annie  would  send  their  faithful  young  listeners  cipher  disks  or 
secret  codes  to  decipher  secret  messages  about  tomorrow’s  adventure.  The 
numbers  or  letters  were  read  by  an  announcer  with  a portentous  voice. 

Even  music  has  a touch  of  cryptology.  About  1898,  composer  Sir  Edward 
Elgar,  best  known  for  his  Pomp  and  Circumstance  march,  wrote  Variations  on 
an  Original  Theme,  in  which  he  musically  depicted  in  each  variation  a member 
of  his  circle  of  friends,  his  wife,  and,  to  end  the  piece,  himself.  Elgar  labeled 
the  basic  theme  in  G minor,  on  which  the  individual  portraits  were  the  varia- 
tions, “Enigma,”  and  said  that  it  was  itself  a variation  on  another  piece  of 
music — which  he  never  disclosed.  “The  Enigma  I shall  not  explain — its  ‘dark 
saying’  must  be  left  unguessed,”  he  wrote,  adding,  “.  . . the  principal  theme 
never  appears.”  Many  persons  have  tried  to  guess  what  the  Enigma  theme 
might  be:  a phrase  from  Parsifal,  one  from  Pagliacci,  or  the  theme  of  Auld 
Lang  Syne.  None  has  won  acceptance.  But  it  is  possible  that  a clue  to  the 
Enigma  lies  hidden  in  a cryptogram  that  Elgar  sent  to  one  of  the  “varia- 
tionees”  in  1897 — Miss  Dora  Penny,  the  Dorabella  of  Variation  X.  As  a girl 
in  her  twenties  she  spent  much  time  with  Elgar,  and  when  she  asked  him  about 
the  Enigma,  protesting  that  she  simply  could  not  figure  it  out,  she  was  told  by 
the  composer,  “I  thought  you,  of  all  people,  would  guess  it."  He  would  say 
no  more.  The  cryptogram  consists  of  87  characters  consisting  of  one,  two,  or 
three  curves  in  various  positions  and  looking  as  a whole  rather  like  a flock  of 
sheep.  Nobody  has  solved  it,  and  so  nobody  knows  whether  it  will  shed  any 
light  on  the  Enigma.  But  if  it  does,  it  may  help  resolve  one  of  the  oddest 
mysteries  in  the  musical  domain.

Finally,  there  is  the  case  of  the  painting  with  its  title  in  code.  This  might 
perhaps  be  more  understandable  if  the  painting  were  abstract,  but  in  fact  it  is 
a powerful  representational  image  of  two  conspirators,  one  whispering  into 
the  ear  of  the  other.  Part  of  a series  of  12  x 16-inch  tempera  panels  depicting 
the  birth  of  the  United  States  and  its  struggle  for  freedom,  the  picture,  by

RUMRUNNERS,  BUSINESSMEN,  AND 
MAKERS  OF  NONSECRET  CODES 


the  star  prosecution  witness  in  the  New  Orleans  Federal  Court  on 
May  2,  1933,  was  a new  kind  of  detective.  Instead  of  tailing  suspects  through 
the  mazes  of  the  underworld,  she  tracked  down  letters  through  the  tortuous 
labyrinths  of  code  and  cipher.  Instead  of  dusting  surfaces  for  fingerprints,  she 
applied  sensitive  analytical  tests  that  developed  traces  of  plaintext.  Yet  her 
evidence  could  be  fully  as  incriminating  as  the  gumshoe  methods  of  ordinary 
police  work.  Mrs.  Elizebeth  Smith  Friedman,  a cryptanalyst  for  the  Coast 
Guard,  was  about  to  testify  to  her  solutions  of  coded  messages  of  the  Con- 
solidated Exporters  Company,  Prohibition’s  largest  and  most  powerful 
bootlegging  ring — messages  that  at  last  connected  the  ringleaders  to  the 
actual  operations  of  the  rumrunning  vessels. 

It  was  not  the  first  time  Mrs.  Friedman  had  done  this.  As  the  national 
thirst  grew  during  year  after  year  of  Prohibition,  as  speakeasies  sprang  up 
and  disregard  for  the  law  became  rampant,  geniuses  of  crime  battened  on  the 
illegal  demand.  Small-time  hoodlums  like  A1  Capone  burst  forth  as  big 
businessmen.  Whole  syndicates,  rivaling  in  intricacy  and  geographic  disper- 
sion the  industrial  giants  of  America,  came  into  being  just  for  smuggling. 
Crime  became  organized — and  the  foundations  laid  in  those  days  support  the 
Mafia  and  the  Cosa  Nostra  of  today. 

The  lessons  of  organization  learned  by  the  bootleggers  on  land  were 
taught  to  the  rumrunners  at  sea,  who  brought  in  from  foreign  countries  the 
flow  of  liquor  without  which  the  whole  criminal  operation  would  dry  up. 
While  the  hoodlums  ashore  had  to  contend  with  Prohibition  agents  of  the 
Department  of  Justice,  those  afloat  had  to  contend  with  the  United  States 
Coast  Guard — charged,  during  Prohibition  no  less  than  before  or  after,  with 
preventing  smuggling  into  the  United  States.  As  the  rumrunners  became  more 
numerous  and  better  organized,  they  turned  increasingly  to  radio  to  control 
their  offshore  fleets.  Messages  between  ship  and  shore  stations  warned  of 
Coast  Guard  countermeasures,  told  ocean-going  ships  where  to  meet  the 
small  fast  craft  that  would  run  the  liquor  in  to  some  secluded  cove,  ordered 
decoy  tactics  by  one  ship  to  let  another  slip  past  a picketing  Coast  Guard

Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

patrol,  reported  that  a Coast  Guard  ship  was  tailing  a rumrunner  and  advised 
that  no  speedboats  be  sent  out,  and  in  general  coordinated  rumrunning 
activities  in  a highly  efficient  and  effective  manner. 

Naturally  their  messages  were  coded.  But  although  Coast  Guard  radio- 
men had  long  been  intercepting  them  and  forwarding  them  to  headquarters, 
no  law-enforcement  agency  could  break  them  down.  By  April  of  1927, 
hundreds  of  intercepts  had  accumulated  in  the  Coast  Guard  intelligence  office 
files. 

Then  Commander  Charles  S.  Root  conferred  with  the  Bureau  of  Prohibi- 
tion, and  Prohibition  employed  Mrs.  Friedman  and  established  her  in  the 
Coast  Guard  office  in  Washington.  At  the  same  time,  Prohibition  furnished 
the  personnel  and  the  Coast  Guard  the  equipment  for  two  intercept  stations, 
one  in  San  Francisco,  one  in  Florida,  to  assure  a continuing  flow  of  material. 
Within  two  months  Mrs.  Friedman  had  solved  the  bulk  of  the  messages;  she 
then  began  concentrating  on  intercepts  from  Coast  Guard  stations  on  the 
West  Coast  that  dealt  with  current  activities.  Most  of  it  emanated  from  two 
rival  rum  fleets — the  giant  Consolidated  Exporters  Corporation,  whose 
messages  she  was  to  confront  again  and  again  in  her  work,  and  the  so-called 
Hobbs  interests,  both  operating  out  of  Vancouver.  She  solved  the  messages  in 
Washington  and  forwarded  the  results  to  the  Pacific,  by  telegraph  if  they  were 
of  immediate  value,  by  airmail  otherwise.  To  save  time  and  make  intercepts 
immediately  available  in  plain  language  at  the  point  where  they  were  needed, 
Mrs.  Friedman  went  to  the  West  Coast  in  June  of  1928  to  teach  C.  A. 
Housel,  of  the  office  of  the  Coordinator  of  the  Pacific  Coast  Details,  how  to 
decrypt  rumrunners’  messages  in  systems  that  Mrs.  Friedman  had  already 
solved.  Housel  proved  himself  apt  and  industrious,  and  in  the  next  21  months 
he  handled  3,300  messages  between  four  or  five  shore  stations  and  two  dozen 
vessels. 

As  a result  of  the  information  obtained  from  cryptanalysis  and  from 
direction-finding,  the  Coast  Guard  put  increasing  pressure  on  the  smugglers’ 
activities.  Evidently  the  bootleggers  discovered  the  weakness  of  their  wireless 
operation,  particularly  their  codes  and  ciphers,  for  in  two  years  their  radio 
and  cryptographic  organizations  ramified  at  an  enormous  rate.  Whereas  in 
1927-28  only  two  general  systems  were  in  use,  changed  only  every  six  months, 
in  mid-1930  practically  every  rum  boat  on  the  Pacific  Coast  had  its  own  code 
or  cipher.  In  May  of  1930,  for  example,  the  Consolidated  Exporters  Corpora- 
tion, with  three  shore  stations,  employed  a different  cryptosystem  from  its 
headquarters  to  each  of  its  “blacks,”  or  rumrunning  craft,  while  the  mother 
ship  corresponded  with  these  blacks  in  an  entirely  different  system.  In  the  fall 
of  1929,  this  giant,  which  had  gobbled  up  most  of  its  competition  in  the 
Pacific,  established  a branch  in  Belize,  British  Honduras.  Traffic  in  this  Gulf 
Coast  branch  rapidly  climbed  to  several  hundred  cryptograms  a month.  On 
the  Atlantic  side  of  Florida,  25  cryptograms  a day  were  intercepted,  while  in 
the  New  York  region,  in  only  five  days  in  February  of  1930,  a radio  inspector

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


heard  no  fewer  than  45  unlicensed  stations  from  within  ten  miles  of  New 
York.  They  were  involved  in  operations  from  Nova  Scotia  to  the  Bahamas. 
It  was  reported  that  one  syndicate  paid  its  radio  expert  $10,000  a year — this 
during  the  Depression ! A retired  lieutenant  commander  of  the  Royal  Navy 
devised  the  systems  for  Consolidated  Exporters’  Pacific  operation,  though  its 
Gulf  and  Atlantic  groups  made  up  their  own  as  needed. 

His  name  was  unknown,  but  his  cryptologic  expertise  was  apparent.  The 
smugglers’  systems  grew  increasingly  more  complicated.  “Some  of  these  are 
of  a complexity  never  even  attempted  by  any  government  for  its  most  secret 
communications,”  wrote  Mrs.  Friedman  in  a report  in  mid-1930.  “At  no  time 
during  the  World  War,  when  secret  methods  of  communication  reached  their 
highest  development,  were  there  used  such  involved  ramifications  as  are  to  be 
found  in  some  of  the  correspondence  of  West  Coast  rum  running  vessels.” 
One  such  system,  employing  two  different  commercial  codes,  passed  through 
five  steps:  The  clerk  (1)  encoded  the  plaintext  in  the  commercial  ABC  Code, 
6th  edition,  (2)  added  1000  to  the  numerical  codegroup,  (3)  looked  up  this 
codenumber  in  another  commercial  code,  the  Acme,  (4)  transcribed  the  code- 
word opposite  that  codenumber,  and  (5)  enciphered  that  codeword  in  a 
monalphabetic  substitution.  Much  of  this  complexity,  however,  was  vitiated 
by  the  clerk’s  habit  of  only  partially  encoding  messages  and  enciphering  the 
rest  in  a monalphabetic  substitution  that  appears  to  have  been  the  same  as 
for  the  code.  Mrs.  Friedman  illustrated  the  process  with  an  actual  message 
(which  may  have  some  slight  errors  in  it):

Mrs.  Friedman  solved  the  system.  “In  this  case,”  she  wrote,  “an  inspec- 
tion determined  that  the  system  employed  came  under  the  general  classifica- 
tion of  Enciphered  Code.  Then  began  what  seemed  endless  experimentation 
to  determine  the  particular  type  of  enciphered  code.  There  are  hundreds  of 
public  codes  any  one  of  which  might  have  been  used,  and  in  order  to  discover 
which,  it  was  necessary  to  solve  the  cipher  applied.  With  enormous  difficulty 
the  cipher  alphabet  was  built  up,  by  which  the  groups  actually  appearing  in 
the  messages  were  resolved  into  code  groups  of  the  Acme  Code.  But  as  this 
resulted  in  no  intelligible  meaning,  it  was  obvious  that  further  steps  were 
necessary  in  order  to  reach  clear  language.  The  processes  of  experiment 
continued,  the  search  among  hundreds  of  code  books  was  again  prosecuted, 
and  finally  the  whole  laborious  process  was  revealed.”

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Friedman  solved  12,000  messages  in  just  her  first  three  years  for  the  Coast 
Guard,  the  Bureau  of  Customs,  the  Bureau  of  Narcotics,  the  Bureau  of 
Prohibition,  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue,  and  the  Department  of  Justice. 
About  the  same  number  of  messages  were  examined  and  discarded.  In 
October  and  November  of  1929,  she  spent  a month  in  Houston,  Texas, 
solving  a mass  of  smuggling  traffic  subpoenaed  by  the  United  States  Attorney. 
Among  the  approximately  650  messages  in  24  systems  were  some  that  were  to 
play  a role  in  a case  world-famous  in  international  law. 

Her  solutions  made  it  clear  to  the  Coast  Guard  that  obtaining  this  informa- 
tion on  a current  basis  would  enable  the  government  agencies  to  take  action 
that  would  prevent  smuggling.  It  therefore  embarked  upon  an  experiment 
unique  in  the  annals  of  cryptology  and  criminology:  a floating  cryptanalytic 
crime-detection  laboratory.  This  was  CG-210,  a 75-foot  patrol  boat  com- 
manded by  Lieutenant  Frank  M.  Meals,  a former  telegraph  operator  and 
radioman  who  in  1924  had  compiled,  with  civilian  employee  Robert  T. 
Brown,  the  Coast  Guard’s  first  codebook.  CG-210  was  specially  outfitted  with 
a battery  of  high-frequency  receivers,  direction-finders,  and  a cryptanalyst — 
none  other  than  William  F.  Friedman,  lent  by  the  Army  for  two  weeks  of 
nautical  codebreaking.  Between  September  14  and  27,  1930,  Friedman  solved 
the  code  used  by  a group  of  smugglers  operating  off  New  York  and  read  the 
operating  orders  to  their  ships,  completely  preventing  them  from  transferring 
any  liquor  to  shore  for  several  days.  “The  resulting  confusion  to  this  group  of 
rum  ships  was  more  than  all  the  efforts  of  the  destroyer  force  and  the  other 
units  combined  have  been  able  to  effect  in  months — and  it  should  be  re- 
membered that  this  was  accomplished  by  a single  patrol  boat  with  nine  men 
aboard  which  never  went  near  ‘rum  row,’  ” wrote  Lieutenant  Commander 
F.  J.  Gorman,  head  of  the  Coast  Guard's  intelligence  office.  In  addition, 
CG-210  located  an  unlicensed  radio  station  in  New  Bedford,  Massachusetts, 
used  to  control  the  rum  ship  Nova  V;  this  was  raided  by  Justice  and  Commerce 
department  officials,  and  the  operator,  Joseph  Travers,  found  guilty  of  illegal 
transmissions,  largely  on  the  basis  of  the  cryptanalyzed  evidence. 

These  spectacular  results  led  the  Coast  Guard  to  concentrate  even  more 
on  the  bootleggers’  communications,  the  weakest  link  in  the  criminal  chain 
of  operations.  Intelligence  office  chief  Gorman  wrote:  “This  intercepted 
material  contains  much  of  the  information  that  the  investigative  agencies  of 
the  Customs  and  Justice  are  after  and  practically  all  of  the  plans,  including 
contact  points,  to  obtain  which  the  Coast  Guard  vessels  cruise  endlessly.”  In 
1930,  the  Coast  Guard  established  a radio-intelligence  unit  under  the  com- 
mand of  Lieutenant  Meals.  The  unit,  attached  directly  to  headquarters  for 
freedom  of  action,  covered  the  entire  Atlantic  Coast.  At  New  York  six 
commissioned  and  five  warrant  officers  learned  radio-intelligence  work. 
Eventually  four  more  75-foot  patrol  boats,  fitted  out  like  CG-210,  put  to  sea 
with  a commissioned  officer  in  command,  a cryptanalyst,  and  six  radiomen  to 
combat  the  rumrunners’  communications. 


807 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

The  cryptanalysts  who  went  to  sea  did  not,  however,  have  either  the 
experience  or  the  material  with  which  to  undertake  the  long  and  difficult 
solution  of  some  of  the  systems  employed  by  the  rumrunners.  Their  work  was 
primarily  current,  involving  perhaps  the  stripping  of  a superencipherment 
from  a rumrunner  code.  Unfortunately,  the  headquarters  cryptanalytic  unit — 
on  which  the  whole  radio-intelligence  operation  depended — consisted  of  only 
Mrs.  Friedman  and  a clerk.  She  explained  in  a memorandum  how  this  situa- 
tion cramped  Prohibition  law  enforcement : 

For  the  past  several  years  intercept  activities  maintained  both  by  the  Coast 
Guard  and  by  other  agencies  concerned  with  the  enforcement  of  the  law  regard- 
ing smuggling  have  yielded  a very  large  volume  of  communications  passing 
between  shore  stations  and  ships  engaged  in  smuggling.  With  the  extremely 
limited  personnel  available  for  work  in  connection  with  the  solution  of  this  inter- 
cepted traffic  little  has  been  accomplished  compared  with  what  might  have  been 
and  still  might  be  accomplished  were  an  adequate  and  trained  force  available  for 
solution  activities.  For  the  most  part  the  smugglers  use  extensive  code  books 
which  they  usually  compile  or  have  compiled  for  them  by  code  firms.  From  a 
technical  point  of  view  the  solution  of  code  messages  is  much  more  difficult  and 
requires  much  greater  time  and  effort  than  does  the  solution  of  ciphers.  More- 
over, in  the  case  of  code  the  mere  breaking  down  of  the  basic  system  is  only  the 
beginning  of  the  work,  because,  unlike  cipher  systems,  the  solution  of  one  mes- 
sage discloses  very  little  about  the  remaining  messages.  The  solution  of  code  is  a 
long-drawn-out  process,  which  must  be  continued  through  the  life  of  the  code,  if 
all  messages  are  to  be  read.  It  may  be  stated  that  every  system  employed  by  the 
smuggling  interests  has  been  solved  but  in  no  case  has  it  been  possible  to  read  all 
of  the  messages  in  view  of  the  large  amount  of  labor  involved  and  the  lamentable 
lack  of  personnel  to  accomplish  the  work. 

As  an  example,  Mrs.  Friedman  gave  a series  of  intercepts  sent  between  a 
shore  station  and  the  rumrunner  Bear  Cat  that  were  solved  only  much  later. 
A 125-foot  Coast  Guard  cutter  was  trailing  Bear  Cat,  which,  upon  reporting 
this,  was  instructed  to  head  for  the  open  sea  as  if  she  were  starting  across  the 
Atlantic.  On  September  22,  1930,  Bear  Cat  wirelessed:  Am  now  120  miles 
south  east  Fire  Island  Light  and  still  going.  Advise.  Replied  the  shore  station : 
Keep  on  going.  Cutter  not  likely  to  stay  much  longer.  And  indeed  the  next  day 
the  cutter,  apparently  convinced  of  Bear  Cat's  legitimacy,  now  that  she  was 
200  miles  out,  dropped  the  chase — whereupon  Bear  Cat  promptly  returned 
to  her  original  rendezvous  and  made  contact.  “If  the  contents  of  the  foregoing 
messages  had  been  made  known  to  the  base  to  which  the  1 25-footer  belonged, 
Mrs.  Friedman  wrote,  “the  latter  would  certainly  have  been  ordered  to  stay 
with  the  Black  indefinitely.” 

Mrs.  Friedman  consequently  urged  the  establishment  of  a seven-man 
cryptanalytic  section  at  headquarters,  consisting  of  a cryptanalyst  in  charge 
at  $4,000  a year,  an  assistant  cryptanalyst  in  charge  at  $2,000,  a senior 
cryptographic  clerk  at  $2,000,  a cryptographic  clerk  at  $1,800,  and  three

assistant  cryptographic  clerks  at  $1,620  each,  for  a total  of  $14,660.  “Fuel 
maintenance  alone  of  one  destroyer  amounts  annually  to  a sum  thousands  of 
dollars  in  excess  of  the  total  cost  of  operating  this  central  unit,”  she  wrote  in 
her  memorandum.  “At  the  present  time  each  Coast  Guard  vessel  travels 
thousands  and  thousands  of  miles  annually  in  a blind  search  over  a given 
area.  In  the  future,  under  such  a plan  as  outlined,  all  such  aimless  activity 
could  be  eliminated  and  the  mileage  reduced  to  a very  marked  degree  because 
the  course  and  contact  positions  of  any  given  rum-runner  would  be  known.” 
These  arguments  convinced.  The  Coast  Guard  included  money  for  this 
cryptanalytic  section  in  its  budget,  Congress  approved  it,  and  on  July  1,  1931, 
it  came  into  being.  The  personnel  were  mostly  Coast  Guard  radiomen. 

On  April  7 and  8,  1932,  it  did  just  as  Mrs.  Friedman  had  foreseen.  Radio- 
intelligence units  solved  messages  from  an  offshore  rumrunner  saying  that  she 
was  then  alongside  a collier  and  loading  her  with  liquor.  Since  the  name  of 
the  collier  and  its  destination  were  unknown,  the  Coast  Guard  advised  all 
units  to  search  all  colliers  arriving  in  Atlantic  ports  within  the  next  few  days. 
On  April  8,  Maurice  Tracy  and  Eastern  Temple  arrived  in  New  York  and 
were  searched.  Nothing  was  found  on  Eastern  Temple,  but  after  the  cargo  of 
coal  was  discharged  from  Maurice  Tracy,  inspectors  found  a large  quantity 
of  liquor  concealed  in  a special  compartment.  Again,  early  in  November, 
1932,  CG-214  intercepted  and  read  messages  from  the  Canadian  rumrunner 
Amacita  indicating  that  she  would  land  liquor  in  Buzzards  Bay,  Massa- 
chusetts. The  Coast  Guard  vessels  coolly  waited  until  Amacita  steamed  into 
the  bay,  then  pounced  and  seized  her  with  a full  load  of  liquor.  The  penalty 
assessed  was  $107,661. 

More  often,  however,  the  radio-intelligence  organization  did  not  realize 
its  optimistic  expectations  of  being  able  to  read  current  messages  quickly 
enough  to  have  them  acted  upon — perhaps  because  the  Depression  reduced 
bootlegging  activity.  Nevertheless,  the  cryptanalytic  section  at  headquarters 
and  the  floating  radio-intelligence  units  under  Lieutenant  Meals  did  furnish 
information  that  helped  capture  and  convict  one  “rummy”  after  another.  For 
example,  the  organization  solved  messages  of  the  rumrunner  John  Manning 
long  after  they  were  of  current  value.  A typical  message  was  that  sent  at  5 
p.m.  on  September  28,  1930,  giving  4ar,  a shore  station,  the  location  of  cee, 
the  John  Manning : cee  yibog  nw  wfylo  wfyje  wydho  wybec  wybug 
wybfo  zabys,  meaning,  John  Manning's  position  now  42  miles  south  by  east 
Fire  Island  Lightvessel.  A few  months  later,  a message  on  February  24,  1931, 
told  John  Manning  to  Go  to  25  miles  east  by  south  from  Winter  Quarter  Light- 
vessel  to  meet  a Bull  Line  ship  at  1 1 p.m.  there.  . . . Though  the  message  was 
solved  too  late  to  catch  the  two  ships  in  the  act  of  transferring  liquor,  the 
mention  of  the  Bull  Line  caused  the  Coast  Guard  to  undertake  an  investiga- 
tion, and  eventually  to  seize  the  Bull  Line  freighter  Arlyn  in  New  York.  The 
cryptanalyzed  evidence  helped  to  convict  its  master  and  three  others  and  to 
sentence  them  to  a year  and  a day  in  jail  for  conspiracy  to  smuggle  liquor 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes  809 

into  the  United  States,  while  Arlyn' s owners  paid  $10,000  to  release  the 
vessel. 

In  addition,  the  five  floating  radio-intelligence  cutters,  plus  some  shore- 
bound  interceptors,  helped  furnish  information  that  led  to  one  raid  after 
another  on  shore  stations,  often  leading  to  captures  of  the  smugglers’  code- 
books. On  December  15,  1930,  for  example,  Coast  Guard  radiomen  began 
picking  up  traffic  from  an  unlicensed  station.  At  2:59  p.m.  January  2,  1931, 
Radioman  1/c  E.  D.  Bump  in  Brooklyn  copied  this  message  to  Ifj,  one  of 
the  station’s  call-signs,  from  3jp,  a rum  ship:  Ifj  de  3jp  r hw  msg  ck25

later  ar  ar.  Triangulation  soon  located  the  station  at  5671  Hudson  Boule- 
vard, North  Bergen,  New  Jersey.  Law-enforcement  officers  raided  it  on 
January  23,  1931,  arresting  Frank  H.  Brown  and  finding  a codebook  that  ran 
from  00001  abact  = again  to  03108  ajlhi  = bank,  together  with  “two 
sheets  of  cipher  alphabet.”  With  this  aid  the  message  of  January  2 was  read 
as:  R HW  [meaning  unknown]  Message  check  25  [groups].  [We  will ] try  lose 
cutter  Stop  Position  is  12  miles  southwest  Fire  Island  Lightvessel  9 p.m.  Stop 
Boat  will  wait  position  there  daylight  tomorrow  morning  Stop  Password  later. 
The  doubled  ar  at  the  end  may  have  been  a signature.  This  and  other  messages 
were  collected  for  use  as  evidence  for  a rumrunning  prosecution. 

In  another  case,  after  almost  two  months  of  intercepting  such  messages 
as  z 5 gr  8 q844  q997  q823  q985  q833  l394  t269  q797  t239  ar  as,  lawmen 
swooped  down  on  448  Highland  Avenue,  Newark,  New  Jersey.  As  the 
New  York  Journal  put  it  in  the  supercharged  style  of  the  day:  “Federal  agents 
struck  with  a vicious  hand  today  at  the  very  vitals  of  a gigantic  rum  ring, 
raiding  its  $100,000  radio  broadcasting  station  at  Newark  and  silencing  the 
unseen  voice  that  guides  its  carriers  of  contraband  into  sheltered  coves  at 
night.”  The  entire  top  floor  of  a 14-room  house  was  given  over  to  a 500-watt 
radio  station  controlling  a fleet  of  eight  fast  125-foot  rum  ships  that  carried 
4,000  to  6,000  cases  of  liquor  on  each  trip  from  Canadian  ports.  In  addition, 
three  codebooks  were  found,  one  of  them  an  extract  for  ready  reference  of 
the  larger  basic  code,  a third  using  obscene  language  and  apparently  for  the 
personal  messages  of  the  crew.  They  enabled  Boatswain  John  M.  Gray  of  the 
radio-intelligence  unit  to  decode  the  Z 5 message  to  Do  you  believe  ire  can 
load  tonight  around  midnight.  These  messages  too  served  as  evidence. 

Mrs.  Friedman,  meanwhile,  was  solving  not  only  rumrunners’  messages 
but  those  of  other  highly  organized  smuggling  gangs  that  had  adopted  their 
methods.  She  went  to  Vancouver  to  testify  in  a trial  of  Gordon  Lim  and 
several  other  Chinese  that  their  secret  messages,  cast  in  a complicated  system 
involving  Chinese,  dealt  with  opium-smuggling.  They  were  convicted  and 
sentenced  to  seven  years’  imprisonment.  In  San  Francisco,  the  solution  of 
such  messages  as  Our  shipment  goes  today.  It  consists  of  520  tins  of  smoking 
opium  and  20  tins  sample,  70  ounces  cocaine,  70  ounces  morphine,  40  ounces 


810 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


heroin  . . . induced  dope-runners  Israel  and  Juda  Ezra  to  plead  guilty.  They 
were  sentenced  to  twelve  years  in  jail — “twelve  years,”  a Pacific  Coast 
columnist  wrote,  “in  which  to  try  to  devise  a code  that  a woman  couldn’t 
break.” 

The  climax  of  her  criminal  work  came,  however,  at  the  celebrated  Con- 
solidated Exporters  Corporation  trial  in  New  Orleans.  After  taking  over  in  the 
Pacific  and  establishing  its  large  operation  at  Belize,  British  Honduras,  this 
syndicate  of  crime  spun  a network  of  activities  completely  surrounding  the 
United  States.  Its  agents  were  not  only  in  Mexico  and  Belize,  they  also 
infiltrated  New  Orleans,  Miami,  Havana,  Nassau,  and  Montreal.  Consoli- 
dated virtually  monopolized  rumrunning  in  the  Pacific  and  the  Gulf  of 
Mexico.  It  became  one  of  the  largest  liquor-smuggling  outfits  in  the  country. 

During  all  this  time,  the  Coast  Guard  intelligence  office  in  Mobile  was 
intercepting  hundreds  of  the  outfit’s  messages,  and  when  law-enforcement 
agents  swooped  down  on  2831  North  Rampart  Street,  New  Orleans,  on 
April  11,  1932,  they  seized  many  more.  In  the  same  raid  they  found  a large 
consignment  of  liquor  and  arrested  many  of  the  bootleggers.  The  messages 
were  sent  to  Coast  Guard  headquarters  in  Washington  where  the  cryptanaly- 
tic  unit,  headed  by  Mrs.  Friedman,  broke  them  down.  The  messages  directed 
the  rumrunners  Ouiatchouan , Rosita,  Albert,  and  Concord  to  the  vicinity  of 
locations  to  which  they  had  earlier  been  tracked  by  the  Coast  Guard,  thus 
affording  a positive  link  between  the  ringleaders  and  the  actual  operations  of 
the  smuggling  vessels. 

After  Mrs.  Friedman  related  this  vital  evidence,  the  grand  jury  in  Novem- 
ber indicted  35  rumrunners  for  conspiracy  to  violate  the  National  Prohibition 
Act.  Part  of  the  indictment  charged 

(11)  That  a secret  code  or  codes  would  be  and  were  framed  and  constructed 
for  use  in  sending  and  receiving  messages  over  said  radio  apparatus  from  and  to 
the  premises  and  places  aforesaid,  and  from  and  to  the  ships  at  sea,  hereinbefore 
referred  to  as  “rum-runners,”  and  more  particularly,  the  ships  hereinbefore 
described,  and  to  a radio  station  located  in  Belize,  British  Honduras; 

(12)  That  said  messages,  transmitted,  broadcasted  and  received,  unlawfully 
as  aforesaid,  would  have  to  do  with  the  location  and  time  of  arrival  of  said 
“rum-runners,”  and  the  smuggling  and  landing  of  large  quantities  of  intoxicating 
liquors  from  said  “rum-runners”  into  the  United  States  by  the  means,  the  man- 
ner and  methods  aforesaid ; that  said  radio  messages  in  said  secret  code  would  be 
sent  and  received  over  said  radio  apparatus  from  the  State  of  Louisiana  to  the 
stations  and  ships  aforesaid,  concerning  the  smuggling  of  intoxicating  liquors 
into  the  United  States. 

The  trial  began  May  1,  1933,  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the 
Eastern  District  of  Louisiana,  before  Judge  Charles  B.  Kennamer.  The  case 
was  so  important  that  the  Justice  Department  sent  Colonel  Amos  W.  W. 
Woodcock,  former  Director  of  Prohibition,  to  prosecute  it  in  person.  He  said 
in  his  opening  statement  that  Albert  M.  Morrison,  Nathan  Goldberg, 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes  811 

Merchant  D.  O’Neal,  and  the  latter’s  brother,  Joseph  O’Neal,  were  the 
“brains  of  the  ring  which  purchased  millions  of  dollars  of  contraband  whisky 
from  Canada  and  other  foreign  countries  and  smuggled  it  into  points  along 
the  Gulf  coast,  from  which  it  was  distributed  inland.  Mrs.  Friedman  took 
the  stand  after  wireless  technician  Roy  E.  Kelly  identified  32  messages  inter- 
cepted from  March  24  to  April  10,  1931,  between  the  rum  ships  and  stations 
in  New  Orleans  and  in  Belize.  One,  sent  at  7:06  a.m.  March  25,  read;

After  Mrs.  Friedman  had  been  sworn  in,  Woodcock  qualified  her  as  an 
expert  in  cryptanalysis  by  having  her  state  that  she  had  been  doing  that  work 
since  1916,  mostly  with  the  United  States  government,  and  that  she  had  been 
employed  by  the  War,  Navy,  State,  and  Treasury  departments.  After  a mild 
objection  by  the  defense.  Judge  Kennamer  ruled  that  “The  witness  is  quali- 
fied.” Then,  without  describing  her  method  of  analysis  or  the  system,  Mrs. 
Friedman  testified  to  her  solutions  of  the  Consolidated  Exporters  Corporation 
messages.  The  rummies  had  used  a rather  complex  method.  They  had  compiled 
their  own  vocabulary  and  assigned  to  its  terms  the  five-letter  English  words 
that  the  Western  Union  Travelers'  Code  Book,  a 68-page  pocket  code  given 
out  free  by  that  telegraph  company,  employed  as  codewords  to  represent  such 
phrases  as  Detained  here  in  Quarantine.  But  the  rumrunners  shifted  these 
equivalents  according  to  indicators.  Thus,  in  a message  beginning  with  the 
indicator  bergs,  the  plaintext  number  nine  would  be  represented  by  the  code- 
word smart,  whereas  in  a message  beginning  with  indicator  caber,  nine 
would  be  smash  and  smart  would  now  represent  plaintext  eight.  There  were 
nine  of  these  indicators,  including  quids,  and  hence  nine  sets  of  equivalents 
in  the  messages,  making  it  a kind  of  code  polyalphabetic  system.  The  mes- 
sages of  7:06  and  6:22  read  (after  eliminating  the  call-signs  and  abbrevia- 
tions): Substitute  50  Canadian  Club  balance  Blue  Grass  for  Corozal  Stop 
Repeat  Tuesday  wire  Concord  go  to  latitude  29.50  longitude  87 .44  and  When 
Rosita  is  loaded  proceed  latitude  29.35  longitude  87.25. 

The  defense  objected  to  each  of  the  solutions  on  the  ground  that  the 
witness’s  testimony  “elicits  a conclusion  and  it  is  opinion.  Mrs.  Friedman 
made  a statement  that  “This  is  not  a matter  of  opinion.  There  are  very  few 
people  in  the  United  States,  not  many  it  is  true,  who  understand  the  principle 
of  this  science.  Any  other  experts  in  the  United  States  would  find,  after 
proper  study,  the  exact  readings  1 have  given  these.  It  is  not  a matter  of

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


personal  opinion — ” at  which  point  Woodcock  cut  in  and  said,  “Well,  never 
mind  that.”  Defense  attorney  Walter  Gex,  Sr.,  asked  that  “all  that  be 
excluded.  I think  it  is  very  improper.”  The  judge  ruled  it  out  of  the  jury’s 
consideration. 

Gex  cross-examined  Mrs.  Friedman,  putting  to  her  the  usual  questions 
that  oversimplify  the  problem  of  cryptanalysis  in  an  attempt  to  undermine 
the  credibility  of  the  solution.  He  evidently  was  unaware  of  the  shifting  nature 
of  the  code  symbols;  otherwise  he  would  surely  have  capitalized  on  that 
difficulty — for  each  additional  link  in  the  complicated  chain  of  cryptanaly- 
tical  reasoning  makes  it  less  certain  and  therefore  less  incriminatory. 

Q How  shall  I address  you.  Madam  or  Miss? 

A I am  Mrs.  Friedman. 

Q Mrs.  Friedman,  I understand  the  symbols  sent  you,  you  know  nothing  at  all 
about  them,  but  you  received  a copy  of  the  symbols,  which  they  asked  you  to 
analyze  and  translate  ? 

A Yes. 

Q Before  you  could  properly  translate  those  symbols,  somebody  had  to  tell  you 
it  was  symbols  in  reference  to  the  liquor  transportation? 

A Oh,  no.  I might  receive  symbols  pertaining  to  murder  or  narcotics. 

Q Could  the  same  symbols  be  used  in  a conspiracy  in  the  Mann  Act  of  bringing 
girls  here  from  another  country? 

A They  could  have,  but  it  would  be  my  business — 

Q Well— 

Mr.  Woodcock : Let  her  answer. 

Mr.  Gex:  I thought  she  was  through.  Go  ahead. 

A ( witness  continuing) Such  symbols  could  be  used  for  such  purposes,  but  it 

would  not  be  possible  for  me  to  say  they  referred  to  liquor  when  they  actually 
referred  to  the  Mann  Act. 

Q Well,  what  symbols  refer  to  liquor  as  a symbol  itself? 

A This  is  a code.  You  cannot  say  that — 1 cannot  tell  you  which  symbol  refers  to 
liquor  without  going  through  the  entire  thing. 

Q It  is  not  a standard  code;  a code  these  gentlemen  may  have  made  up  them- 
selves ? 

A Yes. 

Q Then  you  had  to  take  all  the  words  and  the  whole  correspondence  to  fit  them 
in? 

A Yes.  That  is  my  business  to  analyze. 

Q You  mean  to  tell  this  jury  the  same  words  could  not  have  been  used  in  a 
conspiracy  to  violate  the  Mann  Act?  * 

A Not  with  the  meaning  that  was  given  them  here. 

Q I know;  you  gave  them  the  meaning? 

A No,  1 did  not  give  them  the  meaning.  The  meanings  were  not  created  by  me 
and  put  alongside  the  code  words.  I obtained  these  meanings  by  scientific 
analysis.  I did  not  obtain  them  by  any  guess  work. 

Q Suppose  I used  the  word  cor  a to  mean  whiskey  and  the  Colonel  here  used  the 
word  aim  to  mean  whiskey,  how  would  you  analyze  it? 


813 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

objection:  Mr.  Woodcock. 

That  is  not  a fair  question.  I object. 

Mr.  Gex:  She  is  under  cross-examination. 

The  Court:  Just  explain. 

A If  I did  not  receive  anything  except  those  two  words,  it  would  be  impossible 
for  me  to  state  that  one  meant  one  thing  and  the  other  meant  another  thing, 
or  that  both  meant  the  same  thing.  My  business  is  to  analyze  material  of 
which  I have  a sufficient  amount  to  demonstrate  with  the  scientific  analysis 
applied.  I do  not  state  that  I can  solve  anything.  It  depends  upon  the  amount 
of  material  I have  on  the  type  of  system  used. 

Q You  would  not  tell  this  jury  that  the  same  symbols  these  gentlemen  used  to 
mean  what  you  say,  whiskey,  beer,  position,  could  not  have  been  made  up  by 
people  in  code  for  transportation  of  women  from  Europe  ? 

A Those  symbols  could  have  been  used  for  that  purpose,  yes. 

BY  THE  COURT: 

Q But  you  say  that  they  were  not  used  for  that  purpose  in  this  case 

A Yes. 

Q And  you  determined  that  from  study  of  all  symbols  you  used  in  their  relation 
one  to  the  other  ? 

A Certainly. 

After  a five-day  trial,  Morrison,  the  two  O’Neals,  and  two  other  smugglers 
were  convicted,  Goldberg  and  the  others  acquitted.  Morrison,  the  ringleader, 
was  sentenced  to  two  years  in  the  Federal  Penitentiary  at  Atlanta  and  was 
fined  $5,000  after  his  conviction  was  upheld  by  the  United  States  Circuit 
Court  of  Appeals.  And  on  June  28,  1933,  Woodcock  wrote  the  Secretary  of 
the  Treasury:  “I  am  taking  the  liberty  to  bring  to  your  attention  the  unusual 
service  rendered  by  Mrs.  Elizebeth  Smith  Friedman  in  the  trial  of  the  largest 
smuggling  case  which  the  Bureau  of  Prohibition  made  during  the  last  two 
years.  . . . Mrs.  Friedman  was  summoned  as  an  expert  witness  to  testify  as  to 
the  meaning  of  certain  intercepted  radio  code  messages.  . . . Without  their 
translations,  I do  not  believe  that  this  very  important  case  could  have  been 
won.” 

Neither  before  nor  since  have  criminals  ever  used  such  extensive  and 
complicated  systems  of  secret  writing,  and  neither  before  nor  since  has  so 
strong  an  effort  been  mounted  against  them.  Mrs.  Friedman  fought  in  this 
arena  as  the  champion  of  the  law,  at  first  singlehandedly  and  then,  late  in  the 
game,  as  the  leader  of  a small  band.  Appropriately  enough,  she  crowned 
this  work  with  solutions  of  messages  that  helped  destroy  one  of  the  largest 
smuggling  rings  in  the  United  States.  While  she  had  the  satisfaction  of  a job 
well  done.  Woodcock’s  letter  must  have  come  as  a very  welcome  appreciation. 

It  was  probably  not  lost  upon  her  that  he  had  prosecuted  in  the  name  of  the 
United  States  of  America. 

In  1934,  some  of  Mrs.  Friedman’s  earlier  solutions  helped  to  extricate  the 
United  States  from  an  embarrassing  diplomatic  tangle  and  to  establish  a

point  of  international  law.  Among  the  intercepts  that  she  had  solved  during 
her  trip  to  Houston  in  1929  were  23  that  had  no  connection  with  any  case 
then  under  investigation  by  the  United  States  Attorney  there.  Between 
October  2,  1928,  and  March  15,  1929,  they  had  been  exchanged  between  the 
cable  address  carmelha,  which  belonged  to  the  well-known  liquor  import- 
export  firm  of  C.  A.  Melhado  in  Belize,  and  the  New  York  cable  addresses 
harforan  and  mocana,  both  of  which  were  unregistered.  The  American 
authorities  had  intercepted  them  as  they  passed  over  the  radio  circuits  of  the 
Tropical  Radio  Company  at  New  Orleans.  A typical  message  was  this:

Mrs.  Friedman  had  little  difficulty  in  discovering  that  they  had  been  encoded 
in  Bentley's  Complete  Phrase  Code  and  that  the  placode  group  had  been 
replaced  by  the  codegroup  five  places  forward  in  the  codebook.  This  message's

On  her  way  back  to  Washington,  she  stopped  off  at  New  Orleans  and  gave 
her  solutions  to  Edson  J.  Shamhart,  supervising  customs  agent  there.  Sham- 
hart  practically  leaped  out  of  his  chair  with  a whoop.  He  had  been  trying  to 
help  the  State  Department  resolve  the  difficult  case  of  the  schooner  I'm  Alone. 
This  handsome  two-master  had  been  built  in  Nova  Scotia  in  1924  for  the 
liquor  trade,  which  she  had  plied  vigorously  and  profitably.  In  1928  she  was 
sold  to  new  owners,  but  her  mission  remained  the  same.  On  March  20,  1929, 
when  the  Coast  Guard  cutter  Wolcott,  suspecting  her  of  running  liquor, 
ordered  her  to  heave  to,  she  refused.  The  ships’  positions  then  were  given  by 
the  boatswain  in  command  of  Wolcott  as  10.8  miles  from  shore,  well  within 
the  12-mile  territorial  limit,  and  by  the  captain  of  I'm  Alone  as  15  miles  from 
shore.  A chase  began.  Wolcott  fired  a warning  shot,  then  turned  her  guns  on 
the  schooner  itself,  damaging  her  sails  and  slightly  wounding  the  captain. 
Shoal  water  caused  Wolcott  to  fall  back,  however,  and  it  was  not  until  March 
23  that  she  and  another  cutter,  Dexter,  again  caught  up  with  I'm  Alone.  This 
time,  at  a point  220  miles  from  shore  and  well  out  of  American  jurisdiction, 
Dexter  poured  shells  into  I'm  Alone  and  sank  her  with  her  Canadian  flag 
waving. 

Relations  between  the  United  States  and  Canada  were  already  somewhat 
strained  over  the  liquor  question,  since  the  exporting  of  liquor  was  entirely 
legal  in  Canada,  and  the  I'm  Alone  sinking  exacerbated  feelings.  A member  of 
the  Canadian  Parliament  even  claimed  that  the  attack  was  an  act  of  war  if  it 
had  been  carried  out  under  official  instructions.  Canada  demanded  8386,000 
for  loss  of  the  vessel  and  its  cargo.  This  claim  was  based  on  the  presumption 
that  the  vessel  was  Canadian-owned.  American  officials  contended  that  the 


815 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

ship  had  been  challenged  in  territorial  waters,  that  hot  and  continuous  pursuit 
had  ensued,  and  that  international  admiralty  custom  sanctioned  her  sinking. 
In  addition,  they  strongly  suspected  that  the  schooner  belonged  to  Americans, 
in  which  case  the  affront  of  sinking  a Canadian  flag  could  be  adjusted  between 
friendly  powers  by  a formal  apology  and  a token  cash  indemnity. 

Unfortunately,  they  had  little  success  in  tracing  the  owners— until  Mrs. 
Friedman  walked  into  Shamhart’s  office  with  her  translations  of  messages  to 
and  from  New  York.  For  the  dates  of  arrival  and  orders  to  sail  and  quantities 
of  alcohol  listed  in  the  messages  agreed  perfectly  with  the  sailing  dates  of 
I'm  Alone  from  Belize  and  with  the  quantities  of  Scotch,  rye,  and  malt  in  her 
manifests.  Some  detective  work  discovered  that  the  cable  addresses  mocana 
and  harforan  belonged  to  one  Dan  Hogan,  a New  York  bootlegger  and 
half-owner  of  I'm  Alone,  who  was  arrested  and  convicted.  In  the  winter  of 
1934-35,  a Canadian  and  an  American  justice  of  the  two  countries’  Supreme 
Courts  sat  as  a court  of  arbitration  in  the  I'm  Alone  case.  They  agreed  that 
the  doctrine  of  hot  pursuit — the  rule  that  lets  a policeman  who  begins  chasing 
a speeder  in  his  own  state  arrest  him  in  another — held  in  international  law, 
settling  this  moot  point  for  the  first  time.  They  granted  Canada  $50,666  for 
the  flag  insult  (the  United  States  also  formally  apologized),  but  ruled  against 
the  Canadian  claim  for  restitution  to  the  owners  of  I'm  Alone.  At  the  time 
they  decided,  among  the  items  of  evidence  before  them  were  the  23  solutions 
of  Elizebeth  Smith  Friedman. 

The  great  Teapot  Dome  oil  scandal  of  the  1920s  revealed  corruption  and 
rottenness  in  the  dealings  of  some  of  the  highest  ranking  and  wealthiest  men 
in  America.  The  list  began  with  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  Albert  B.  Fall, 
who  had  leased  out  for  development  the  rich  Teapot  Dome  naval  oil  reserve 
in  Wyoming  to  Harry  F.  Sinclair  and  the  Elk  Hills  reserve  to  Edward  C. 
Doheny  of  the  Pan  American  Petroleum  Company.  This  he  did  in  secret  on 
the  ground  of  national  security. 

When  this  came  to  light  early  in  1924,  the  Senate  Public  Lands  Committee 
began  an  investigation.  It  soon  obtained  an  admission  from  Edward  B. 
McLean,  editor-president  of  the  Washington  Post,  that  he  had  lent  Fall 
$100,000  for  which  he  had  neither  canceled  checks  nor  stubs  nor  any  kind  of 
receipt.  McLean  denied  knowing  Sinclair  or  anything  at  all  about  the  oil 
reserves  matter.  But  then  the  committee  dug  up  a number  of  messages  in 
code,  mostly  to  and  from  McLean,  one  to  Doheny.  It  turned  them  over  to  the 
Army  for  an  attempt  at  solution.  On  March  4,  1924,  the  committee  heard 
sworn  testimony  concerning  their  readings  from  the  chief  of  the  code  section 
in  the  Signal  Corps,  William  F.  Friedman.  His  task  had  not  been  too  difficult, 
because  he  had  access  to  all  three  of  the  codes  used.  The  Doheny  message 
used  a private  code  of  the  Pan  American  Petroleum  Company:  the  company 
furnished  a decode  of  the  message  to  the  committee,  who  gave  it  to  Friedman, 
who  merely  checked  it.  The  McLean  messages  were  encoded  either  in 


816 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Bentley  s Complete  Phrase  Code,  used  straight,  or,  surprisingly,  in  a code  of  the 
Department  of  Justice’s  Bureau  of  Investigation  (forerunner  of  the  F.B.I.). 
It  gave  rise  to  such  messages  as  the  one  to  McLean  on  January  9,  1924, 
whose  odd-sounding  language  tickled  the  fancy  of  many  newspaper  readers :

HOCUSING  LECTIONARY  CHINCHILLA  PETERNET  BEDAGGLED  RIP  RALE 

OVERSHADE  QUAKE  STOP  .... 

The  Justice  Department  code  partook  of  the  characteristics  of  both  a one- 
part  and  a two-part  code.  Like  the  German  diplomatic  code  13040,  which 
figured  in  the  Zimmermann  telegram,  it  was  a hybrid.  Thus,  in  the  encoding 
section,  while  the  plaintext  ran  alphabetically  from  a to  z,  the  initial  letters  of 
the  codewords  ran  from  r to  w,  from  n to  Q,  and  from  a to  m.  The  breaks 
occurred  in  the  middle  of  the  plaintext  e’s  and  i’s.  Thus  eight  was  wippen  and 
end  was  nautch,  interrogation  was  quake  (appropriately  enough)  and  is  was 
acerbate.  The  January  9 message  thus  read:  Zevely  thinks  trend  of  investiga- 
tion favorable  to  you.  Not  impressed  with  Walsh  as  cross-examiner.  Thinks  you 
need  have  little  apprehension  about  forthcoming  interrogation.  . . . 

Friedman  read  the  McLean  messages  by  “means  of  a code  book  which  I 
obtained  at  the  Department  of  Justice  from  Mr.  [William  J.]  Burns,”  director 
of  the  Bureau  of  Investigation.  (The  codeword  for  burns  in  that  code  was 
sniveling — how  that  must  have  given  the  punsters  a field  day!)  And  how  had 
McLean  gotten  this  official  code?  Soon  after  Warren  G.  Harding  was  elected 
President,  McLean  explained,  he  himself  was  made  a special  agent  of  the 
Department  of  Justice  and  was  given  a little  card,  a badge,  and  the  Justice 
Department  code.  The  sender  of  the  January  9 message,  William  O.  Duck- 
stein,  McLean’s  private  secretary,  was  a former  Justice  agent  who  seems 
simply  to  have  kept  the  book.  Burns  later  took  the  stand  to  explain  to  the 
committee  that  when  he  came  into  the  Justice  Department  he  found  that  the 
old  code  was  so  widely  held  that  he  had  a new  one  made  up,  only  two  copies 
of  which  were  given  to  each  branch.  He  instructed  the  agents  in  charge  “that 
whenever  an  agent  went  out  on  a more  important  case,  where  it  would  require 
the  use  of  an  absolutely  secret  code  in  order  to  communicate  with  either  me 
or  the  local  office,  they  were  to  use  this  new  secret  code.  The  other  code  is 
used  by  the  agents  in  the  field  when  they  get  into  a little  town  and  do  not  care 
to  write  out  a telegram  that  the  operator  could  spread.  Mr.  McLean  had  a 
code  book.  Every  agent  that  asked  for  one  could  have  one;  but  not  so  with 
the  new  code.” 

Friedman’s  decodings  of  the  McLean  messages  showed  McLean  exhibit- 
ing an  intense  interest  in  a matter  about  which  he  had  said  he  knew  nothing. 
The  plaintext  readings  tended  to  suggest  that  McLean’s  $100,000  loan  to 
Fall  was  in  fact  involved  in  the  oil  reserves  matter  and  was  not  just  some 
pleasant  isolated  transaction.  It  was  soon  discovered  that  the  money  had 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes  817 

really  come  from  Doheny.  Fall  was  later  convicted  of  accepting  a $100,000 
bribe  and  served  a year  and  a day  in  jail.  Doheny  and  Sinclair  were  acquitted 
of  trying  to  bribe  a public  official,  but  their  leases  on  the  reserves  were 
canceled. 

Cryptology  did  not  supply  an  essential  link  to  these  events.  Its  contribu- 
tion seems  peripheral.  Friedman’s  testimony  spiced  the  proceedings  with  the 
mystery  of  code  and  cipher  and  helped  revitalize  flagging  public  interest  in  the 
expose — and  public  interest  is,  in  the  long  run,  the  only  force  for  honesty  in 
government. 

Criminals,  like  anyone  else,  will  bother  with  codes  and  ciphers  only  when 
they  have  to,  and  the  only  time  they  really  need  them  is  in  international 
smuggling,  when  illegal  movements  have  to  be  coordinated  in  secrecy  over 
great  distances.  In  1934,  Swedish  police  gave  cryptologist  Yves  Gylden  some 
cipher  messages  sent  by  smugglers,  a typical  one  of  which  read:  16  48  59  74 
29  53  99  32  86  28  60  0 St-a  55  67  29  07  28  67  55  44  46  63  80  90  02  99  06 
03  15  05  74  59  69  00.  He  quickly  determined  that  it  was  a rather  simple 
homophonic  substitution  and  that  the  plaintext  read:  Overlamna  28600  St-a 
allt  klart  henom  [error  for  genom ] sparren,  with  the  00  meaning  period.  As  a 
result  of  these  solutions,  completed  August  19,  the  police  lay  in  wait  for  the 
fast,  low  Kismet,  whose  crew  discovered  that  things  were  not  “allt  klart” 
when  they  were  nabbed  on  September  26  with  5,000  liters  of  illegal  liquor. 

The  greatest  era  of  international  smuggling — Prohibition — created  the 
greatest  era  of  criminal  cryptology.  Complicated  criminal  systems  of  code  and 
cipher  are  now  rare.  They  survive  only  in  the  drug  traffic — the  only  major 
international  smuggling  racket  still  in  existence.  For  example,  two  heroin 
smugglers,  John  D.  Voyatzis  and  Elias  Eliopoulos,  encoded  their  messages  in 
the  Universal  Trade  Code,  then  moved  the  center  digit  to  the  front,  and  re- 
placed the  new  digit  with  the  equivalent  five-letter  codeword  in  that  book. 
Thus  the  plaintext  sold  was  encoded  to  58853;  this  became  85853,  which  was 
turned  into  xiqwd.  Much  simpler  systems  exist  side  by  side  with  the  better 
ones.  In  1955  some  dope  traffickers  that  used  the  aircraft  of  the  British 
Overseas  Airway  Corporation  as  their  transport  wired  some  accomplices  in 
Bahrein,  ordering  19  could  manage  more  if  available,  which  meant 
Arrive  Bahrein  19th.  Could  carry  more  opium  than  last  time. 

Today,  most  criminal  cryptology  springs  from  the  efforts  of  bookmakers 
to  conceal  or  nullify  evidence  of  their  illegal  activity.  The  systems  are  highly 
specialized  and  suitable  only  for  bookmaking.  Usually  they  combine  encipher- 
ment of  numbers  with  abbreviations  for  recording  bets  and  payoffs;  they  do 
not  have  sufficient  scope  to  encipher  ordinary  plaintext.  Their  solution 
demands  as  great  a knowledge  of  the  various  illegal  forms  of  gambling  as  the 
bookie’s  own,  for  the  “plaintext”  will  be  only  a series  of  numbers! 

One  highly  popular  game  is  policy,  or  the  numbers  racket.  The  bettor  puts 
his  money — which  may  be  as  little  as  a dime — on  a three-digit  number.  If  the 


818 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


number  turns  up,  he  wins  666  times  his  wager.  These  odds  considerably  favor 
the  house.  Many  variations  and  combinations  exist  beyond  this  basic  bet. 
He  can  play  any  permutation  of  the  three-digit  number,  winning  correspond- 
ingly less  if  one  of  the  six  permutations  shows  up.  (Usually  the  three-digit 
number  is  determined  by  a syndicate  from  the  last  digits  of  the  total  amount 
wagered  on  three  successive  horse  races  at  a nearby  track.) 

Perhaps  the  world’s  expert  in  solving  policy  codes  was  Abraham  P. 
Chess,  who,  before  his  transfer  to  another  bureau  of  the  New  York  City 
government,  frequently  broke  them  for  the  New  York  City  Police  Depart- 
ment as  a sideline  to  his  normal  work  as  an  attorney  in  the  department’s  legal 
bureau.  He  had  become  interested  in  cryptology  when  he  read  Poe’s  “The 
Gold-Bug”  at  18,  but  got  into  criminal  cryptanalysis  quite  by  accident. 

In  1940,  a New  York  City  detective  spent  the  greater  part  of  a day  watch- 
ing a policy  collector  take  bets  and,  it  appeared,  note  them  down.  But  when 
the  detective  made  his  arrest,  he  found  to  his  surprise  that  the  notes  constituted 
not  the  usual  bet  record,  but  several  sheets  of  music,  neatly  staffed  and  scored, 
complete  with  treble  clefs,  slurs,  and  hold  and  crescendo  marks.  Without 
evidence  that  the  collector  was  actually  engaged  in  bet-taking  rather  than 
some  odd  but  wholly  legal  activity,  the  arrest  would  not  stick.  The  detective 
felt  sure  that  the  music  constituted  some  kind  of  code,  but  the  New  York 
City  Police  Department  laboratories  had  no  cryptanalysts.  Then  another 
detective  remembered  that  a young  lawyer  in  the  legal  bureau  was  interested 
in  cryptology,  and  the  “music”  was  sent  to  30-year-old  Abe  Chess. 

When  he  tried  it  on  a piano  it  proved  to  be  virtually  unplayable  and 
absolutely  unmusical.  He  soon  observed  that  only  ten  different  notes  were 
used  and  that  the  measures  were  highly  irregular.  In  seven  hours  he  dis- 
covered that  each  note  represented  a number,  the  number  being  determined 
by  the  note’s  position  on  the  staff.  The  bottom  line,  normally  e in  music, 
stood  for  1,  the  bottom  space,  normally  e,  for  2,  the  second  line  from  the 
bottom,  normally  G,  for  3,  and  so  on  to  the  first  space  over  the  scale,  norm- 
ally G,  for  0.  Each  measure,  set  off  by  a bar,  recorded  a separate  wager,  and 
the  repeat  sign  of  two  dots  at  the  end  of  a measure  indicated  a combination 
play.  Altogether,  the  score  held  10,000  bets.  Chess’s  testimony  in  court 
brought  about  a conviction  that,  without  his  evidence  of  bet-taking,  would 
have  been  impossible. 

From  that  first  solution,  Chess  went  on  until  by  1951  he  attacked  56  such 
systems,  or  more  than  one  a week.  Their  variety  was  astonishing.  To  represent 
numbers,  the  gamblers  used  Greek  letters  or  Hebrew  letters  or  even  ancient 
Phoenician  letters;  or  they  invented  characters  or  used  the  system  that  equates 
the  numbers  with  a 10-letter  word  that  has  no  repeated  letters.  If  this  keyword 
were  CUMBERLAND,  a policy  bet  of  25  cents  on  the  number  137  would  be 
written  cmlue — the  number  is  ordinarily  given  first  with  the  bet  following, 
usually  without  a space  between  them.  One  system  appeared  at  first  to  be 
shorthand  notes  in  which  some  of  the  characters  were  identical  with  others 


819 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

except  for  their  shading,  some  being  dark  and  some  light,  just  as  in  Pitman 
shorthand.  Chess  soon  discovered  that  a light  diagonal  slanting  from  the 
upper  left  was  1,  that  the  same  diagonal  written  heavily  was  2,  and  that  the 
other  numbers  were  coded  similarly.  Another  policy  collector’s  notebook 
contained  long,  bizarre  words  like  sinkkatyundeyo.  Chess  puzzled  over  this 
for  almost  three  hours  until  he  suddenly  recalled  that  the  suspect  came  from 
French  West  Africa.  The  “code”  was  nothing  more  than  French  numerals 
written  phonetically  as  they  are  pronounced  in  the  suspect’s  dialect,  except 
that  zero  was  represented  simply  by  the  letter  o.  sinkkatyundeyo  meant 
cinq  quatre  un  deux  zero,  or,  on  number  541,  a 20-cent  bet.  Chess  compiled 
frequency  tables  for  policy  games,  which  the  New  York  City  Police  Depart- 
ment still  uses  in  its  solutions.  Chess  eventually  left  the  Police  Department, 
but  the  work  he  started  proved  so  valuable  to  law  enforcement  that  today  the 
department  has  a number  of  individuals  to  solve  all  the  gamblers’  codes  it 
gets.  The  Chief  Inspector’s  Investigations  Unit,  the  Police  Academy,  the 
Police  Laboratory,  and  the  Police  Commissioner’s  Confidential  Unit  all 
have  cryptanalysts. 

Police  departments  not  fortunate  enough  to  have  an  Abe  Chess — and  this 
means  nearly  all  of  them— often  call  upon  the  F.B.l.  for  the  solution  of 
encoded  bookmaking  records.  The  F.B.L  does  this  work  in  its  Cryptanalytical 
and  Translation  Section,  whose  existence  it  seeks,  for  some  reason,  to  conceal; 
it  has  even  lied  about  its  location.  In  fact  the  section  operates  in  a plain  cream- 
colored  concrete  building  with  no  markings  except  its  street  number — 215 
Pennsylvania  Avenue,  South  East,  in  Washington,  D.C.  A marquee  testifies 
to  its  former  use  as  Frank  Small’s  auto  agency,  but  the  show  window  has  been 
bricked  up  and  even  the  owner  of  the  liquor  store  next  door  knows  only  that 
it  houses  some  hush-hush  activity.  Though  the  building  stands  almost  within 
the  shadow  of  the  Capitol  dome,  it  is  so  situated  that  no  one  can  look  into 
its  windows.  On  the  ground  floor  is  a classroom  and  a green  blackboard, 
sometimes  covered  with  exercises  in  symmetry  of  position;  on  the  upper 
floors  are  the  offices.  Entrance  is  through  a courtyard  in  the  rear. 

But  if  the  F.B.L  hides  the  place  where  it  effects  its  solutions  of  bookmak- 
ing codes  for  law-enforcement  agencies,  it  does  not  hide  its  light  under  a 
bushel  when  it  comes  to  telling  of  its  successes. 

Cryptosystems  involving  bookmaking  usually  fall  into  one  of  two  general 
categories.  The  most  common  system  involves  digital  encryption,  that  is, 
reduction  of  most  of  the  betting  data  to  numbers  and  then  enciphering  these 
numbers.  Tracks  are  assigned  arbitrary  number  or  letter  equivalents,  horses  are 
identified  by  post  position  or  racing  sheet  numbers,  amounts  and  types  of  wagers 
are  indicated  by  numbers  significant  by  their  position  in  the  entries  as  well  as 
their  identity.  Super-encipherment  is  frequently  the  substitution  of  letters  or 
symbols,  or  combinations  of  these,  for  the  code  numbers.  The  second  general 
class  of  “bookie”  cryptosystems  involves  phonetic  and  related  types  of  abbrevia- 
tions, including  use  of  foreign  or  corrupted  language  text. 


820 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Cryptanalytic  techniques  employed  by  the  F.B.I.  Laboratory  to  break  these 
“bookie”  ciphers  are  conventional  in  the  sense  that  they  rely  heavily  upon  letter 
and  digital  frequency  characteristics  of  the  various  types  of  bookmaking  entries, 
and  trial  and  error  testing  of  probable  betting  data.  F.B.I.  experts  have  examined 
and  broken  literally  thousands  of  encrypted  betting  entries  during  the  past  dozen 
years  [1950  to  1961]  and  have  developed  a highly  skilled  acuity  for  penetrating 
this  type  of  material.  This  skill  is  a combination  of  pure  cryptanalytics  and  a very 
comprehensive  knowledge  of  betting  procedures  and  operations. 

Indeed.  To  understand  the  plaintext,  much  less  the  cryptanalysis,  would 
require  an  extended  course  of  tuition  at  Churchill  Downs,  Pimlico,  and 
Saratoga,  with  perhaps  a week  at  Las  Vegas  for  postgraduate  work.  The 
entries  are  highly  abbreviated,  so  that  a few  code  symbols  can  represent  what 
would  take  a few  dozen  words  to  spell  out.  The  bookmakers  also  rely  heavily 
on  their  memory  for  many  details,  including  especially  the  names  of  bettors, 
which  are  almost  never  entered.  Nevertheless,  the  F.B.I.  cryptanalysts  nearly 
always  master  the  systems.  In  one  case,  Hebrew  script  served  to  encipher  the 
numbers,  Yiddish  phonetics  the  names  of  the  horses,  and  the  arrangements 
of  numbers  combined  with  symbols  like  parentheses  the  types  of  bets.  After 
an  F.B.I.  cryptanalyst  took  the  stand  at  the  bookie’s  trial  in  Lancaster, 
Pennsylvania,  the  bookie  changed  his  plea  from  innocent  to  guilty.  He  was 
fined  and  sent  to  jail. 

When  Boston  police  raided  a betting  parlor,  they  confiscated  racing  forms, 
racing  magazines,  sports  editions  of  newspapers,  and  a pocket  notebook 
containing  handwritten  symbols  like  Greek  letters.  When  questioned  about 
this,  the  suspect  told  police  that  he  was  a student  of  the  classics;  he  conceded 
that  he  was  trying  also  to  work  out  a system  for  beating  the  horses,  but  denied 
that  he  was  a bookie.  Privately,  however,  he  boasted  to  friends  that  the  cops 
would  never  break  his  code  and  that  until  they  did  he  was  going  to  continue 
to  book  horses.  Boston  police  sent  the  notebook  to  the  F.B.I.,  who  soon 
established,  for  example,  that  a = 1,  </>  = 2,  a = 9,  /?  = 11,  <5  = 12,  both 
h and  o = 50,  ) = parlay,  and  so  on.  The  entries  proved  so  highly  abbre- 
viated that  even  after  the  plaintext  meanings  were  established  considerable 
interpretation  was  necessary.  With  the  testimony  of  an  F.B.I.  agent,  the 
Boston  prosecutor  was  able  to  prove  that  the  defendant  had  maintained 
“apparatus  for  the  registering  of  bets  on  the  result  of  a contest  of  speed  or 
endurance  of  a certain  beast,  to  wit,  a horse,”  and  to  win  a conviction. 

Another  Boston  case  depended  wholly  upon  the  solution  of  200  pages  of 
coded  information  found  in  three  notebooks  in  a raided  clothing  store  sus- 
pected of  being  a bookmaking  front.  The  F.B.I.  solved  it  relatively  quickly, 
and  found  that  the  basic  encipherment  involved  transforming  letters  into 
numbers  with  the  key

Other  cipher  symbols  included  brd  for  $1  on  a daily  double,  erd  for  $2  on  a 
daily  double,  nyd  for  50c  on  a daily  double,  blt  for  $1  across  the  board,  nlt  for 
$5  across  the  board,  a check  to  indicate  a payoff,  and  so  on.  Thus  the  cipher 
f\G  bzbz  gb  meant  a bet  on  the  No.  4 horse  in  the  third  race  of  $10  to  win  and 
$10  to  place;  the  horse  paid  $6.20  on  a $2  bet  to  place  for  a return  of  $31  on 
the  $10.  After  a three-hour  trial,  during  which  an  F.B.I.  cryptanalyst  testified 
to  the  solution,  the  clothing  store  operator  was  convicted  of  bookmaking. 

Less  common  than  bookie  and  policy  systems  are  the  occasional  ciphers 
used  to  plan  jail  breaks,  to  note  proposed  robberies  or  burglaries,  to  record 
illicit  activities.  Nearly  always  these  are  of  an  extremely  simple  nature, 
usually  a monoalphabetic  substitution  using  symbols.  When  New  York  City 
police  broke  up  a ring  in  1959  that  produced  and  sold  pornographic  films, 
they  found  enciphered  records  that  listed  the  names  and  addresses  of  300 
actresses  and  what  they  would  perform  for  the  cameras.  Police  easily  broke 
the  cipher,  a rather  simple  one  consisting  largely  of  abbreviations  and  symbol 
substitutions,  and  began  making  arrests  wholesale.  Prisoners  use  the  ubiqui- 
tous knock  cipher,  based  on  the  checkerboard,  to  transmit  information  from 
one  cell  to  another.  Thus  one  knock  followed  by  two  means  b,  two  knocks 
followed  by  one  indicates /.  The  system  serves  in  jails  all  over  the  world.  Less 
specifically  criminal  but  still  outside  the  law  was  the  “code”  used  by  New 
York  City  employment  agencies  to  designate  the  race  or  color  preferences  of 
employers.  One  agency  used  no  nfu’s — the  latter  originally  standing  for  “Not 
for  us” — to  mean  No  Negroes.  Another  wrote  recommended  by  redbook  to 
mean  that  Negroes  are  not  wanted  and  must  play  saxophone  to  mean  that 
Jews  should  not  bother  to  apply.  Such  designations  are  prohibited  by  the 
New  York  State  law  on  fair  employment  practices,  and  in  1962  at  least  one 
employment  agency  signed  a consent  order  in  which  it  promised  not  to  use 
them  again.  In  1960,  the  United  States  accused  five  big  electrical  concerns — 
including  General  Electric  Company  and  Westinghouse  Electric  Corporation 
— of  violating  the  antitrust  laws.  The  firms’  executives  replaced  the  names  of 
the  firms  with  numbers  as  a simple  code  to  help  conceal  their  agreeing  to  fix 
prices  and  to  rig  bids  so  that  profits  would  be  assured.  Thus  1 stood  for 
General  Electric,  2 for  Westinghouse , 3 for  Allis-Chalmers  Manufacturing 
Company,  and  so  on.  The  system  was  transparent,  however,  and  the  executives 
got  30  days  in  jail. 

Card  sharks  mark  their  cards,  which  constitutes  a kind  of  cryptography, 
and  they  communicate  clandestinely  with  one  another  by  various  body  or 
voice  signals.  Particular  ways  of  holding  a cigarette  or  scratching  an  itch  can 
indicate  various  suits  or  cards.  In  one  common  hand-signal,  a gambler 
quickly,  almost  casually,  places  his  hand  against  his  chest,  thumb  spread,  to 
mean  I'm  going  to  take  this  game.  Anybody  want  to  partner  with  me?  A right 
hand,  palm  down,  on  the  table,  means  yes';  a fist  on  the  chest  or  table  means. 
No,  Em  working  single,  and  I discovered  these  guys  first,  so  scram.  In  one  of 
the  English  whist  clubs  of  Victorian  days,  a player  would  tell  his  partner

which  suit  to  lead  by  a casual  comment,  the  first  letter  of  which  was  the  same 
as  the  first  letter  of  the  suit.  Thus  “have  you  seen  old  jones  in  the  past 
fortnight?”  would  mean  that  hearts  was  to  be  led.  Such  systems  are  limited 
only  to  the  ingenuity  of  the  gamblers.  The  position  of  cards  on  the  table  can 
represent  ace,  king,  queen,  or  jack.  Knees  can  be  touched  under  the  table. 
Accusations  of  cheating  by  such  means  at  the  world  bridge  championships  in 
Buenos  Aires  in  May,  1965,  were  hurled  at  the  British  team  of  Boris  Shapiro 
and  Terence  Reese.  But  the  subtlety  of  the  signals— a way  of  puffing  a cigar, 
of  scratching  an  ear,  of  breathing,  of  anything  that  people  might  ordinarily 
do — made  it  extremely  difficult  to  prove  the  accusation  true  or  false. 

Jargon,  because  of  its  allusive  nature  and  easy  comprehension,  seems  to  be 
widely  used  in  illegal  activities  that  involve  considerable  contact  with  the 
public,  such  as  vice.  In  1961,  police  in  Graz,  Austria,  noticed  that  curio 
dealer  Alexander  Kotzbeck  got  more  customers  than  a nearby  milk  store. 
Checking,  they  discovered  that  he  was  telephoning  his  customers  to  report 
that  the  baroque  angel  had  arrived,  or  that  the  rococo  statue  could  be 
picked  up  immediately.  The  “angels”  and  the  “statues”  turned  out  to  be 
living  dolls— call  girls  aged  between  18  and  24.  The  police,  having  broken  the 
code,  broke  up  the  vice  ring. 

Spoken  jargon  of  this  kind  borders  upon  argot,  the  language  of  thieves. 
Argot  is  just  one  of  many  specialized  vocabularies  used  in  various  social 
groups,  from  children  to  sailors  to  printers.  Because  such  social  factors  as 
exclusiveness,  mutual  experiences,  the  need  to  discuss  common  technical 
operations,  and  delight  in  word  games  engender  such  specialized  “languages,” 
they  arise  all  over  the  globe.  Tinkers  in  Ireland  use  one  called  Shelta.  Cock- 
neys speak  rhyming  slang  (storm  and  strife  for  wife).  Medical  students  at 
London  University  occasionally  used  Medical  Greek,  a transformation  of 
pairs  of  English  words,  so  that  smoke  a pipe  would  become  poke  a smipe. 
Primitive  tribes  like  the  Langos  and  the  Todas  have  secret  languages.  The 
Chinese  use  them.  Children  are  prolific  in  inventing  them;  each  natural  lan- 
guage seems  to  have  at  least  one  particular  children’s  cipher.  Well  known  in 
English  is  Pig  Latin:  the  speaker  beheads  the  initial  consonant  sound  of  the 
word,  attaches  this  sound  to  the  end  of  the  word,  and  adds  the  syllable  ay. 
Thus  third  becomes  irdthay.  For  words  beginning  with  a vowel,  the  speaker 
simply  adds  way  to  the  end — and  becomes  andway.  Tut  Latin,  or  the  King 
Tut  language,  interpolates  a tut  between  syllables. 

Argot  differs  from  these  languages  in  being,  perhaps,  more  developed, 
more  extended;  in  addition,  while,  like  the  others,  it  includes  many  necessary 
technical  terms  and  serves  as  a sign  that  the  speaker  belongs  to  an  in-group,  it 
incorporates  a much  darker  strain  of  secrecy.  Argot  is  not  an  international 
thieves’  language,  though  some  terms  may  be  international.  It  varies  from 
country  to  country  because  it  is  essentially  a modification  of  the  national 
language.  When  speakers  of  argot  desire  secrecy,  they  can  transmute  either 
the  meaning  of  a word  or  its  form.  Metaphor  plays  a large  role  in  the  former. 


823 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

A lawyer  is  a mouthpiece;  money  is  bread  or  dough  (this  metaphor  occurs 
in  French  as  well);  the  electric  chair  is  the  hot  seat ; solitary  confinement  is  the 
cooler.  Substitutions  of  form  include  abbreviation  (alky  for  alcohol,  con 
man  for  confidence  man),  and  systems  like  Pig  Latin.  These  are  not  widely  used 
in  English  argot  but  are  relatively  common  in  French.  One  French  system  is 
largonji,  so-called  from  its  deforming  the  word  jargon  according  to  its  own 
system:  moving  the  initial  consonant  to  the  back  of  the  word,  adding  an  i, 
and  putting  an  L on  the  front  of  the  word.  French  argot  devised  many 
ingenious  systems,  most  of  them  short-lived ; several  replaced  a word’s  normal 
ending  with  a peculiar-sounding  one.  Thieves  in  Peshawar,  India,  insert  a 
syllable  with  a z in  it  into  words,  so  that  piu  (“father”)  becomes  pizeo  and 
usko  bula  (“call  him”)  becomes  uzuskuzo  buzuleza. 

In  the  Occident,  argot  apparently  began  in  France  in  the  1100s,  in  the 
warren  of  thieves’  dens  and  culs-de-sac  on  the  site  of  the  present  Place 
Maubert  in  Paris  that  was  the  most  famous  Court  of  Miracles,  inhabited  by 
highly  stratified  and  closed  bands.  In  England  it  originated  in  the  16th  century, 
in  America  in  the  18th.  Argot  was  for  hundreds  of  years  a secret  language,  as 
much  owing  to  the  isolation  of  its  speakers  as  to  any  inherent  cryptography. 
Some  poems  written  in  argot  by  the  15th-century  poet-thief  Franqois  Villon 
remain  partly  incomprehensible  even  today.  Argot  lost  most  of  its  secret 
character  when,  in  the  early  19th  century,  the  demolition  of  the  old  quarters, 
the  creation  of  municipal  police,  the  breakdown  of  social  barriers,  destroyed 
the  old  criminal  bands.  They  melted  into  the  population  at  large  and  their 
language  filtered  into  the  common  speech.  Most  terms  disappeared;  some  of 
the  more  colorful  became  slang.  Though  today  criminals  still  use  argot,  its 
secret  character  has  faded — the  police  understand  nearly  all  of  it;  scholars 
write  about  it — and  it  consists  mainly  of  technical  and  professional  terms. 
Crime,  like  everything  else,  has  become  a business. 

And  business,  too,  uses  secret  languages.  The  need  to  conceal  financial 
information  from  the  unscrupulous  led  the  early  church  to  encipher  some  of 
its  financial  transactions  by  using  Greek  letters  to  represent  numbers.  The 
Knights  Templars,  the  semimilitary,  semireligious  order  of  the  Middle  Ages, 
enciphered  letters  of  credit  that  Templars  carried  instead  of  cash  from  one  of 
their  9,000  commanderies  in  Europe  to  another.  The  cipher  alphabet,  like 
their  chapels,  was  based  on  the  Maltese  cross.  In  the  19th  century,  the 
Ottoman  Turks  in  Egypt  used  qirmeh,  an  abbreviated  sort  of  writing,  to 
record  their  tax  and  financial  transactions. 

Free  enterprise  entails  secrecy  almost  inevitably.  Entrepreneurs  must  keep 
secrets  not  only  from  competitors,  but  often  from  consumers.  Thus,  cloth 
merchants  in  Peshawar  insert  miri  as  a kind  of  null  into  words  to  create  their 
secret  languages,  much  as  Pig  Latin  adds  -ay  at  the  end  of  words.  Goldsmiths 
in  Kashmir  drastically  alter  the  form  of  words.  Where  the  normal  forms  of 
“one,”  “two,”  “three”  and  “Will  you  sell?”  in  their  Zergari  dialect  are

akara,  sanni,  trewai,  and  choande  the  goldsmiths  convert  them  into  bin, 
handish,  yandir,  and  phetzu  wahno.  Other  trades  in  India  have  their  own 
dialects — probably  reinforced  by  the  caste  barriers.  Butchers  in  Hanoi  move 
the  initial  consonant  of  a word  to  the  end,  replace  it  with  a ch  sound,  and  add 
an  -im  onto  the  end  of  the  word.  Fish  dealers  at  the  Fulton  Fish  Market  in 
New  York  use  impromptu  codes  to  conceal  their  prices.  Professional  magi- 
cians use  codes  with  their  assistants  in  “mind-reading  acts”;  the  assistant, 
passing  among  the  spectators,  keeps  up  a patter  that  tells  the  magician  what 
objects  the  spectators  hold,  or  the  serial  number  of  a dollar  bill,  or  their 
names.  Among  written  secret  languages  within  various  trades,  perhaps  the 
oldest,  most  widespread,  and  best  known  is  that  of  the  hoboes,  who  chalked 
various  marks  on  the  walls  or  doorposts  of  houses  to  inform  one  another 
that  the  owner  is  a soft  touch,  or  has  a vicious  dog,  or  calls  the  police  upon 
being  approached,  or  makes  one  work  for  the  handout.  But  Social  Security 
is  gradually  eroding  this  particular  cryptography. 

Often,  retail  merchants  will  encipher  wholesale  prices  on  price  tags  so  that 
they  will  know  how  much  discount  they  can  afford  to  give  while  keeping  the 
customer  ignorant  of  the  original  price.  Generally  they  will  replace  the 
numbers  with  letters  according  to  a keyword,  rather  like  the  bookmakers. 
Dealers  in  antiques  and  other  flexibly  priced  items  probably  use  these  systems 
more  than  anyone  else,  though  in  the  1890s  the  impresario  George  Broadhurst, 
then  manager  of  a theater  in  Minneapolis,  encoded  the  night’s  receipts  by 
means  of  the  word  REPUBLICAN  before  telegraphing  them  to  the  Baltimore 
headquarters  of  the  theater  chain.  Such  systems  have  been  solved — sometimes 
with  valuable  commercial  results.  In  one  case  Macy’s,  the  giant  New  York 
department  store,  was  bound  to  observe  manufacturers’  minimum  prices 
until  it  could  prove  that  others  did  not.  It  cracked  the  price-tag  code  of 
Masters,  Inc.,  a large  New  York  discount  house,  and  used  the  information  for 
business  tactics  that  improved  its  own  competitive  position. 

From  these  simple  beginnings  commercial  secrecy  evolves  into  levels  of 
much  greater  complexity.  The  Swedish  match  king,  Ivar  Kreuger,  employed 
cryptography  to  mask  the  hollowness  of  the  enormous  financial  empire  he 
built  up.  For  his  own  use,  he  carried  about  with  him  a tableau  of  26  mixed 
alphabets  graven  on  a small  ivory  plaque.  In  his  office  he  used  cipher 
machines,  which  he  employed  often  enough  to  have  a sign  printed  “Ciphering 
in  progress  here”  to  deny  access  to  that  office.  Rumor  said  that  the  giant  J.  P. 
Morgan  Company  banking  house  had  tried  to  break  his  messages.  Perhaps 
because  of  this,  Kreuger  hired  Yves  Gylden  to  teach  two  of  his  employees 
cryptography.  The  course  of  instruction  ended  suddenly  when  Kreuger 
committed  suicide  and  his  business  honeycomb  collapsed. 

Business  espionage,  which  in  some  respects  is  almost  as  elaborate  as 
governmental  espionage,  with  undercover  agents,  long-range  cameras,  hidden 
microphones,  and  bribes  to  get  the  contents  of  firms’  wastebaskets,  has  rarely 
gone  as  far  as  cryptanalysis,  however.  In  addition  to  the  Macy’s  and  alleged 


825 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

Morgan  cases,  the  only  other  case  known  is  that  of  a firm  in  Hong  Kong  that 
obtained  the  messages  of  a rival  firm  from  an  employee  of  a cable  office. 
These  had  been  encoded  with  a commercial  code  that  was  sold  publicly,  and 
the  intercepting  firm  had  no  trouble  reading  the  messages — and  then  sub- 
mitting bids  of  its  own  that  were  half  a cent  lower  than  those  of  its  rival,  thus 
stealing  considerable  business.  When  the  other  firm  learned  about  this,  it 
began  enciphering  its  code  messages.  Evidently  this  proved  too  much  for  the 
intercepting  firm,  for  it  no  longer  won  bid  after  bid. 

Nevertheless,  to  prevent  this  sort  of  thing  from  even  getting  started,  many 
firms  encipher  their  messages  or — more  frequently — encode  them  with  their 
own  private  code.  Usually  they  are  not  superenciphered,  secrecy  being 
obtained  by  small  printings,  restricted  distribution,  and  careful  supervision 
of  the  codebooks.  Though  these  would  not  guarantee  protection  against  the 
attacks  of  government  cryptanalysis,  they  adequately  guard  the  firm’s  message 
from  the  casual  inspection  of  cable  clerks  or  from  cryptanalysis  by  their  rivals. 
Firms  in  such  highly  competitive  businesses  as  oil  and  mining,  where  informa- 
tion about  a possible  rich  field  can  be  worth  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars, 
are  the  greatest  users  of  such  private  codes. 

In  the  1920s,  with  the  sudden  expansion  of  international  trade  following 
World  War  I,  a number  of  individuals  saw  opportunities  in  what  they  thought 
was  the  need  for  secrecy  in  the  booming  capitalistic  economy.  Inventors 
directed  promotional  efforts  for  the  first  time  more  at  business  than  at  armies 
or  diplomats.  The  understandable  desire  to  get  rich  motivated  the  efforts  of 
such  men  as  Damm,  Hebern,  and  Scherbius,  the  inventors  of  the  rotor;  the 
A.  T.  & T.  Company  promoted  Vernam’s  machine  in  the  hope  of  profit. 
The  inventions  of  these  men  enriched  cryptology  if  not  themselves,  but  the 
efforts  of  many  others  contributed  nothing  either  to  cryptology  or  to  their 
own  pockets.  The  best  known  was  Alexander  von  Kryha,  a handsome  engineer 
of  Ukrainian  extraction  who  energetically  promoted  his  machine.  It  consisted 
of  a simple  cipher  disk,  attractively  housed,  with  gears  controlling  the 
number  of  spaces  it  turned  and  a spring  mechanism  driving  it.  The  encipherer 
found  the  plaintext  letter  in  an  outer  alphabet  and  took  the  letter  inside  it  as 
its  ciphertext;  he  then  depressed  a button,  allowing  the  disk  to  turn  an  ir- 
regular distance  and  stop,  presenting  a new  set  of  cipher  equivalents.  Von 
Kryha  got  a German  professor  of  mathematics,  Georg  Hamel,  to  calculate 
the  number  of  different  permutations  of  alphabets  that  were  possible  with  the 
movable  letters  of  the  cipher  alphabet,  multiplying  this  immense  figure  by  the 
number  of  possible  gear  combinations,  and  then  by  all  the  other  variables  to 
“prove”  that  only  immortals  could  break  the  cipher.  Unfortunately,  the 
mechanism  came  down  to  a simple  polyalphabetic  cipher  with  a single  cipher 
alphabet  and  a period  of  a few  hundred  letters — solvable  within  hours,  not 
millennia.  But  the  company  probably  failed  less  because  of  its  product's 
technical  weaknesses  than  because  of  the  same  lack  of  interest  that  firms  like 
Damm’s  and  Scherbius’  encountered  in  the  business  world  at  large.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


The  effort  to  sell  secrecy  to  the  business  world  runs  like  an  irregular  thread 
through  the  fabric  of  cryptologic  history.  A number  of  firms  manufacture 
cipher  machines  today  and  offer  them  to  the  commercial  world.  Ottica 
Meccanica  Italiana,  a Roman  company,  produces  a rotor  machine.  Standard 
Elektrik  Lorenz  of  Stuttgart  makes  the  Mi-544,  a heavy,  solid,  one-time  tape 
machine.  Hagelin  sells  his  machines.  Gretag,  Limited,  of  Regensdorf- 
Zurich,  Switzerland,  produces  two  machines.  The  kff-58  is  an  electro- 
mechanical device  using  sprocket  wheels  as  the  keying  mechanism.  The 
tc-534  is  a solid-state  digital  device  that  generates  a pseudo-random  key  for 
use  in  a Vernam-like  device.  And  other  companies  manufacture  cipher 
machines  upon  occasion.  But  the  sales  effort  never  really  succeeds  because 
the  commercial  market  is  too  small.  Mining  and  oil  companies  may  buy 
a few,  but  almost  no  one  else.  At  the  time  of  the  coronation  of  England’s 
Queen  Elizabeth  II,  when  the  National  Broadcasting  Company  and  the 
Columbia  Broadcasting  System  were  competing  hotly  to  get  their  films  on 
television  first,  N.B.C.  encoded  its  transatlantic  messages  to  keep  its  plans  away 
from  C.B.S.  But  even  here,  with  millions  of  dollars  at  stake,  N.B.C.  probably 
did  not  use  machines.  The  commercial  cipher  machine  market  is  minuscule. 

Even  in  financial  dealings,  banks  seem  to  prefer  to  rely  upon  codes  and 
ordinary  precautions.  The  system  works  well  enough,  if  the  experience  of  26- 
year-old  David  Hermoni  is  any  guide.  Hermoni,  one  of  three  employees  of 
the  Hollandsche  Bank  Unie  in  Haifa  who  knew  the  bank’s  private  code, 
opened  two  accounts  in  a Zurich  bank  on  September  1,  1958,  on  his  way  back 
from  a vacation.  The  accounts  bore  only  numbers,  not  his  name.  He  then 
cabled  three  New  York  banks  (the  Irving  Trust  Company,  the  Manufacturers 
Trust  Company,  and  First  National  City  Bank)  in  the  private  code,  instructing 
them  to  transfer  $229,988  to  his  two  accounts.  After  calling  in  sick  at  his  job, 
he  flew  to  Zurich,  identified  himself  to  the  Swiss  Bank  Corporation  as  the 
owner  of  an  account,  and  withdrew  $150,000.  He  then  went  to  Credit  Suisse 
and  drew  out  $50,000  from  his  other  account.  But  when  he  returned  to  the 
Swiss  Bank  to  get  another  $25,000,  he  was  arrested;  a confirmation  cable  to 
Haifa  from  one  of  the  New  York  banks  had  tripped  him  up.  Since  things  like 
this  could  happen  as  well  with  cipher  systems,  banks  find  it  unnecessary  to 
invest  in  them.  The  International  Monetary  Fund,  on  the  other  hand,  em- 
ployed Mrs.  Friedman  soon  after  it  was  created  to  set  up  an  elaborate  crypto- 
graphic system,  based  upon  the  one-time  tape;  the  fund  built  a big  safe  to 
hold  all  its  tapes.  But  its  situation  differs  from  those  where  banks  deal  with 
private  transactions;  the  fund’s  activities  may  have  international  repercus- 
sions, and  interested  governments  may  seek  to  discover  its  plans  so  that  they 
may  take  self-advantageous  economic  action. 

Commercial  secrecy  has  had  a moderate  success  in  one  field:  telephonic 
communication.  The  convenience  and  universal  use  of  the  telephone  and  the 
prevalent  fear— if  not  the  actual  prevalence— of  wiretapping  or  switchboard 
eavesdropping  has  led  some  businessmen  to  buy  scramblers.  Excluding  the

installations  constructed  by  the  large  communications  companies  to  protect 
their  radiotelephone  traffic,  at  least  three  companies  in  the  United  States  make 
scramblers.  Deleon  Corporation  of  Palo  Alto,  California,  produces  several 
kinds,  from  a simple,  portable  telephonelike  device  that  fits,  hand-held,  over 
an  ordinary  telephone  to  scramble  the  outgoing  words  and  descramble  the 
incoming,  to  more  elaborate  radio-scrambler  attachments.  They  are  inverters 
and  the  company  describes  the  effect  as  an  “unintelligible  jargon  which  can 
be  vaguely  identified  as  the  sound  of  an  incomprehensible  foreign  language, 
similar  to  the  effect  of  a phonograph  record  player  in  reverse.”  Deleon  pro- 
vides different  ciphony  arrangements  for  different  customers— presumably 
different  inversion  points.  Among  those  customers,  oil  companies  and  mining 
firms  again  lead  the  pack.  Prospecting  teams  will  carry  a scrambler  with  them 
so  that  they  can  report  back  from  the  field  without  fear  that  a wiretap  will 
reveal  their  information.  The  Shell  Oil  Company  used  them,  for  example,  for 
talks  with  drillers  and  lease  buyers.  The  helicopters  that  scout  for  fish  report 
the  locations  of  large  schools  via  Deleon’s  radio  scramblers  so  that  rivals  will 
not  learn  where  the  good  fishing  is.  The  ships  themselves  scramble  their  price 
discussions  with  canneries  so  competitors  will  not  underbid  them.  During 
their  multimillion-dollar  proxy  battle  with  Allan  P.  Kirby  for  control  of  the 
$6  billion  Alleghany  Corporation  in  1961,  brothers  John  and  Clint  Murchison 
of  Texas  telephoned  one  another  using  portable  scramblers.  Police  use  the 
radio  scramblers  on  stake-outs  so  that  criminals  with  police  radios  will  not 
know  that  they  are  being  watched.  The  prices  range  from  about  $150  for  the 
portable  hand-scrambler  to  $450  for  the  radio  scrambler. 

The  Westrex  Company,  a New  York  City  division  of  Litton  Systems, 
Incorporated,  makes  two  inverters  which  differ  only  in  some  minor  technical 
details.  Both  accept  a speech  band  of  from  250  to  2,750  cycles  per  second  and 
invert  it  about  the  midpoint  of  1,500  cycles.  El  A1  Israel  Airlines  used  the 
Westrex  system  to  provide  privacy  for  radiotelephone  calls  from  its  airplanes 
high  over  the  Atlantic.  Most  elaborate — and  most  expensive— of  the  com- 
mercial scramblers  are  those  of  Lynch  Communication  Systems,  Incor- 
porated, of  San  Francisco.  Its  e-7  is  a 319-pound  band-splitter  offering  233 
combinations;  several  of  these  have  reportedly  been  sold  to  some  Latin 
American  countries  and  to  some  communications  firms.  Lynch  also  makes  a 
71 -pound  inverter,  the  b-69,  which  appears  to  preserve  the  quality  and  intel- 
ligibility of  the  speech  much  better  than  the  other  inverters. 

The  most  primitive  form  of  human  graphic  communication — pictures 
resisted  subjugation  to  the  methods  of  secrecy  much  longer  than  its  younger 
brother,  writing.  Images  had  to  await  the  invention  of  technical  means  of 
reproduction  before  they  could  be  distorted  or  scrambled  for  secrecy. 
Cryptographic  literature  records  a few  rare  cases  where  spies  clandestinely 
transmitted  plans  of  fortifications  by  disguising  them  as  parts  of  a drawing  of 
a butterfly  or  a landscape.  But  this  belongs  to  steganography.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Cryptoeidography  (from  the  Greek  “eidos,”  “form”)  encompasses  two 
basic  ways  of  making  pictures  secret.  One  is  based  upon  optics;  it  takes  the 
image  directly  and  distorts  it.  The  other  way  is  based  upon  electricity;  it 
distorts,  not  the  image,  but  an  electrical  current  that  represents  it.  Whether 
the  former  is  akin  to  code  or  not,  the  latter  resembles  cipher  and,  in  respect 
of  its  clear  analogy  to  ciphony,  is  called  “cifax”  (from  “cipher”  +a  shortening 
of  “facsimile”). 

It  might  seem  at  first  that  the  optical  systems  would  be  the  older.  But 
though  lenses  for  distorting  have  been  available  since  at  least  the  time  of 
Anton  van  Leeuwenhoek,  there  was  for  a long  time  no  way  of  recording  the 
distorted  image.  And  when  Louis  Daguerre  devised  such  a method,  it  soon 
became  clear  that  no  amount  of  viewing  an  out-of-focus  photograph  through 
correcting  lenses  would  reproduce  the  original  external  object  with  clarity. 
Since  this  would  mean  that  an  encoded  picture  could  never  be  decoded,  no 
systems  based  on  this  method  were  devised.  (Microphotography  served  in 
communications,  but  that  is  a method  of  steganography.) 

Perhaps  the  first  cryptoeidographic  system  to  employ  classical  optical 
principles  was  a stereoscopic  one.  A stereoscopic  photograph  actually  consists 
of  two  pictures  taken  simultaneously  by  two  cameras  a small  distance  apart ; 
when  the  two  images  are  viewed  in  a special  holder  together,  the  eyes  combine 
them  to  give  a three-dimensional  appearance  to  what  they  see.  The  two  films 
differ  only  in  very  slight  displacements  of  the  images  of  the  objects  shown — 
displacements  ranging  from  only  a fraction  of  a millimeter  to  about  three 
millimeters.  “Because  the  significant  stereo  differences  are  those  of  lateral 
displacement,  it  is  easy  to  imitate  them  in  hand  work,”  wrote  Herbert  C. 
McKay,  director  of  the  Stereo  Guild.  A plaintext  is  scattered  through  a 
cover-text — which  may  be  intelligible,  but  need  not  be — consisting  of  many 
nonsignificants.  The  encipherer  typewrites  this  cover-text  on  a sheet  of 
paper.  He  types  it  a second  time  on  another  sheet,  omitting  the  letters  of  the 
plaintext,  then  shifts  the  paper  in  his  typewriter  ever  so  slightly  and  fills  in  the 
significant  letters  of  the  plaintext.  He  sends  the  two  sheets  by  different  routes 
to  the  recipient,  who  inserts  them  in  his  stereoscope.  The  plaintext  optically 
leaps  up  off  the  page  at  him  in  relief.  “Because  similar  irregularities  will  not 
affect  stereo  relief,”  explained  McKay,  “it  is  possible  to  introduce  random 
irregularities  which  will  not  change  the  stereo  appearance  but  will  positively 
prevent  any  attempt  to  read  the  message  by  measurement  of  spacing.” 
Though  the  system  labors  under  some  practical  disadvantages— both  mes- 
sages must  reach  the  recipient;  the  interceptor  needs  only  a stereoscope  to 
solve  them— it  has  an  intrinsic  theoretical  interest.  A later  system  based  on 
classical  optical  principles  employs  many  tiny  lenses  to  separate  the  plaintext 
image  into  small  portions  and  then  to  rotate  these  portions  out  of  alignment 
with  one  another.  This  system  was  first  devised  in  I960  at  Bausch  & Lomb, 
perhaps  because  it  could  not  work  efficiently  until  plastics  technology  dev- 
eloped a method  of  molding  in  a single  piece  the  scores  of  lenticles  needed.

Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

A more  sophisticated  form  of  optical  cryptoeidography  emerged  with  the 
evolution  of  what  came  to  be  called  “fiber  optics.”  It  had  long  been  known 
that  light  would  travel  in  a curved  path  by  repeatedly  reflecting  itself  from  the 
inner  surface  of  a thin,  curved  conductor,  which  could  be  water  or  glass  or 
other  substances.  But  until  the  1950s  it  had  never  been  possible  to  transmit  a 
picture  along  such  a path.  Then  Dr.  Narinder  Singh  Kapany,  then  in  his  late 
20s  and  at  the  University  of  Rochester,  bunched  many  glass  fibers,  each 
about  a thousandth  of  an  inch  thick,  into  a bundle.  Each  of  these  hair-thin 
“light  pipes”  picked  up  a point  of  light  from  an  illuminated  image  and  trans- 
mitted it  faithfully  to  the  opposite  end  of  the  bundle.  Here  the  fibers,  which 
occupied  the  same  relative  position  at  both  ends,  reproduced  the  image  in  the 
form  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  microscopic  points  of  light  and  dark. 
Kapany  realized  that  if  the  two  ends  of  the  bundle  were  not  alike,  if  the 
fibers  occupying,  say,  the  edges  of  the  input  face  occupied  the  center  of  the 
output  face,  then  the  emerging  image  would  be  scrambled.  To  decode,  the 
image  need  only  be  sent  backward  through  the  same  or  an  identical  bundle. 
He  tested  the  idea,  and  it  worked.  A picture  of  numbers  and  lines  emerged 
from  a bundle  of  about  a quarter  of  a million  fibers  as  an  absolutely  random 
and  shapeless  grouping  of  black  and  white  dots.  Its  decode  appeared  grainy— 
as  do  all  such  images— with  some  “holes”  in  parts  of  the  numbers  and  lines, 
but  fully  intelligible. 

In  this  form,  however,  the  fiber-optic  coder  labored  under  several  practi- 
cal difficulties.  To  make  one,  the  fibers  of  a bundle  are  scrambled  in  the 
middle  of  the  bundle,  which  is  cut  at  that  point.  The  two  halves  then  serve  as 
the  encoder-decoder  pair.  It  is,  however,  extremely  difficult  to  reproduce  a 
particular  scramble;  moreover,  the  loss  of  fiber  material  during  the  cut 
decreases  the  accuracy  of  the  decode.  To  eliminate  these  problems,  Robert  J. 
Meltzer  of  Bausch  & Lomb,  Incorporated,  dissected  the  plaintext  image  not  with 
individual  fibers  but  with  many  small  bundles  of  fibers  about  a tenth  of  an  inch 
thick.  They  pick  up  the  light  of  the  image  at  the  input  face,  offset  it  through 
a scramble  of  the  bundles,  and  emit  it  in  jumbled  form  at  the  output  face. 

For  once  there  appeared  to  be  a fair  potential  in  business  for  a coding 
device.  If  someone  finds  a bank  passbook  or  an  identification  card  with  the 
owner’s  signature  on  it,  the  finder  can  forge  the  signature  to  withdraw  money 
or  gain  improper  access  somewhere.  Personal  credit  companies  reportedly 
have  sustained  considerable  financial  losses  in  this  way.  But  if  the  signature 
were  encoded,  the  finder  would  be  virtually  unable  to  reconstruct  it.  Three 
companies  have  offered  signature-encoding  systems  to  industry:  the  Le- 
Febure  Corporation  of  Cedar  Rapids,  Iowa,  a subsidiary  of  Craig  Systems, 
Incorporated,  with  an  Autho-Visor  system,  R.C.A.,  with  its  Signa-Guard 
systems,  and  Bausch  & Fomb.  In  general,  they  convert  the  signatures  into 
broken  wavy  lines,  rather  like  a highly  magnified  fingerprint.  But  despite  the 
apparently  bright  prospects,  sales  of  the  systems — which  cost  several  thousand 
dollars — have  not  mounted  very  high.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Cifax  systems  have  never  succeeded  commercially,  either.  Probably  the 
most  primitive  are  those  for  enciphering  the  telautograph,  which  reproduces 
handwriting  at  a distance.  Gilbert  S.  Vernam  used  a gear  mechanism  on  the 
telautograph  to  add  a circular  rotation  to  the  original  motion  of  the  hand- 
guided  pen,  producing  a scrawl.  The  decipherer  followed  the  scrawl,  and  his 
mechanism,  subtracting  the  rotation,  traced  out  the  original  writing.  Vernam 
also  invented  a mechanism  that  analyzed  a picture  into  shades  of  white,  light 
gray,  dark  gray,  and  black,  converted  them  into  holes  on  punched  tape,  and 
enciphered  them  with  a keytape  according  to  the  Vernam  principle. 

Cifax  took  a major  step  forward  with  the  invention  of  wirephoto  and 
radiophoto.  A photograph  is  mounted  on  a rotating  drum.  A photoelectric 
cell  scans  the  entire  surface  of  the  picture  and  converts  the  gradations  of  gray 
into  a fluctuating  electric  current  for  long-distance  transmission.  The  brighter 


The  author's  signature  scrambled  by  fiber  optics 

the  spot  of  the  photograph  being  scrutinized  by  the  electric  eye,  the  more 
current  it  will  send  out.  At  the  receiving  instrument,  light-sensitive  paper  on  a 
similar  drum  turns  beneath  a light  source  that  shines  brighter  or  dimmer  in 
ratio  to  the  electric  current;  gradually  the  entire  sheet  is  exposed.  Normally, 
the  two  drums  rotate  at  the  same  constant  speed ; if  they  are  out  of  synchron- 
ization, distorted  images  result.  The  French  engineer  who  invented  this 
system,  Edouard  Belin,  seized  upon  this  weakness  and  made  it  a cryptoeido- 
graphic  strength.  He  rotated  the  drums  at  irregular  intervals  according  to  a 
prearranged  key.  As  long  as  the  sender  and  receiver  ran  according  to  the 
same  pattern,  the  deciphered  images  appeared  normal.  But  an  interceptor 
would  get  only  a blur  of  smudges,  streaks  and  white  spots. 

Belin’s  was  the  best-known  system  for  enciphering  still  pictures,  but  many 
others  were  invented,  for  the  electric  current  of  wirephoto  could  be  deformed 
in  just  as  many  ways  as  the  electric  current  of  a telephone.  Engineers  could 
invert  it.  They  could  divide  it  into  frequency  bands — representing  here  levels 
of  brightness  instead  of  levels  of  voice — and  substitute  one  for  another.  They 


831 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

could  subject  it  to  a time-division  scramble,  or  bury  it  in  noise  and  extract 
it  at  the  receiver.  But  few  of  these  methods  were  ever  used:  no  one  needed 
them. 

Then  came  television,  and  in  the  1950s  in  the  United  States  a great  battle 
over  subscription  television,  also  called  “pay-TV,”  “toll-TV,”  or  simply 
“fee-vee.”  In  pay-TV  viewers  pay  a nominal  sum  to  see  first-run  movies, 
Broadway  plays,  sports  events,  opera,  ballet,  and  other  attractions  not  norm- 
ally on  television— and  to  see  them  uninterrupted  by  commercials.  Apart 
from  the  struggle  within  the  industry  as  to  whether  the  Federal  Communica- 
tions Commission  should  license  any  kind  of  pay-TV  at  all,  the  fee-vee  parti- 
sans disputed  among  themselves  as  to  the  best  kind  of  subscription.  Some 
favored  broadcasting  the  subscription  programs  scrambled  so  that  only 
subscribers  with  a decoder  attached  to  their  television  sets  could  get  a com- 
prehensible picture.  The  subscribers  would  pay  an  installation  and  monthly 
rental  fee  for  the  decoder  and  an  additional  fee  for  each  program  they  watch. 
Other  subscription  TV  firms  proposed  bringing  the  programs  into  the  sub- 
scribing homes  by  wire.  In  urging  wired  TV  before  the  F.C.C.,  the  Jerrold 
Electronic  Corporation  of  Philadelphia  showed  how  easy  it  would  be  for  a 
pay-TV  bootlegger  to  solve  any  broadcast  scramble  and  to  sell  information  or 
equipment  to  unscramble  it  to  the  public.  Jerrold’s  two  reports,  by  Donald 
Kirk,  Jr.,  its  vice  president  and  director  of  research,  comprised  perhaps 
the  first  discussion  in  cryptology  of  TV  cryptanalysis. 

Television  cifax  operates  upon  certain  characteristics  of  the  television 
signal,  and  it  is  no  more  possible  to  understand  it  without  knowing  how  tele- 
vision works  than  it  is  to  understand  codes  and  ciphers  without  knowing  what 
letters  and  words  are.  The  TV  camera  converts  the  light  and  dark  parts  of  the 
image  focused  by  its  lens  upon  a photosensitive  surface  into  proportional 
fluctuations  of  electric  current,  which  is  transmitted  as  a radio  wave.  The 
brighter  the  spot,  the  greater  the  amplitude  of  this  wave.  The  television 
receiver  transforms  the  fluctuations  of  this  wave  into  equivalent  fluctuations 
of  a beam  of  electrons  directed  at  the  phosphorescent  face  of  the  picture  tube. 
The  greater  the  amplitude  of  the  incoming  wave,  the  heavier  the  beam  of 
electrons  pumped  out  by  the  receiver — and  consequently  the  brighter  that 
spot  on  the  picture  tube.  The  camera  scans  the  photosensitive  surface  30 
times  a second,  the  close  succession  of  pictures  giving  the  impression  of 
motion.  Naturally,  the  electron  beam  in  the  receiver  must  sweep  in  exact 
synchronization  with  the  camera,  and  to  assure  this  the  transmitter  sends  out 
at  the  proper  times  a pulse  that  tells  the  receiver,  “Now  start  again  at  the  left- 
hand  edge  of  the  picture  and  begin  sweeping  toward  the  right  at  the  predeter- 
mined rate.”  American  television  divides  the  picture  into  525  horizontal  lines. 
The  horizontal  position  pulse  is  transmitted  for  each  of  these  lines,  or  about 
1,500  times  a second.  To  further  assure  the  synchronization,  the  transmitter 
also  sends  out  a vertical  position  pulse  that  tells  the  receiver,  “Now  start  again 
at  the  top  of  the  picture.” 


832 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


This  system  makes  several  variables  available  to  cifax.  The  most  obvious 
is  the  basic  video  signal — the  one  determining  the  amount  of  light,  or  bright- 
ness, of  the  parts  of  the  picture.  This  signal  is  analogous  to  the  one  that  carries 
the  frequency  of  a voice,  and  cifax  may  deform  it  just  as  scramblers  distort 
the  frequency  signal.  Simplest  of  all  is  inversion.  The  blacks  become  whites 
and  vice  versa,  and  gray  tones  invert  around  a midpoint.  A video  band- 
splitting would  divide  TV  brightness  into  five  groups,  ranging  from  dark  to 
light,  and  replace,  say,  group  1 with  group  4,  group  2 with  group  3,  and  so  on. 
If  these  assignments  remained  unchanged,  Kirk  observed,  the  result  would 
constitute  a kind  of  cifax  mon  alphabetic  substitution.  But  he  noted  that  a 
one-time  system,  affording  perfect  security,  was  theoretically  possible.  As 
the  transmitter  scans  across  a line  of  the  image,  it  discerns  about  300  indivi- 
dual spots  of  light.  Filters  would  discriminate  each  of  these  into  one  of  tele- 
vision’s approximately  25  levels  of  brightness.  Then  a one-time  key  would 
control  the  substitution  of  one  level  for  another.  Between  the  extremes  of 
monalphabeticity  and  one-time  keys  lay  many  possibilities,  Kirk  wrote. 
“In  a conventional  LP  [long-playing]  record  of  the  33  1/3  r.p.m.  type  if  one 
considers  that  the  frequency  response  is  out  to  5,000  cycles  and  that  this 
record  plays  for  some  30  minutes,  then  one  might  conceivably  get  10,000,000 
pieces  of  coding  information  on  the  record.  Now  if  this  record  were  to  last 
for  one  month  and  during  that  month  there  were  to  be  250  hours  of  television 
programming  (this  is  about  one  million  seconds  of  television  programming), 
then  one  can  see  that  this  information  stored  on  an  LP  record  might  be  used 
to  shift  the  coding  signal  some  ten  times  each  second.  ...  Of  course,  it  is 
unlikely  that  one  could  record  as  much  information  as  has  been  listed  here  on 
an  LP  record  and  expect  it  to  stay  synchronized  [with  the  LP  record  used  at 
the  transmitter  to  encipher  the  signal]  for  250  hours  of  television  pro- 
gramming.” 

Noise  might  be  added  to  the  TV  signal.  Synchronization  problems  would 
again  require  this  to  be  of  a fairly  simple  type.  Black  or  white  bars  might 
stripe  the  picture.  A problem  here  is  that  using  the  ends  of  the  video  spectrum 
for  enciphering  reduces  the  amount  of  spectrum  available  for  the  picture, 
resulting  in  less  contrast  and  a washed-out  image.  The  transmitter  might  scan 
the  successive  horizontal  lines  at  varying  rates  instead  of  the  standard  uniform 
speed.  “This  would  pose  a great  problem  in  all  TV  receiver  designs,”  Kirk 
wrote,  “because  much  attention  has  gone  into  cutting  as  much  of  the  cost 
out  of  the  sweep  circuits  of  the  receiver  as  possible.  This  has  resulted  in  a 
sweep  circuit  of  fixed  design.  To  either  speed  up  or  slow  down  this  sweep 
circuit  by  an  appreciable  amount  would  require  major  modifications,  and, 
therefore,  costly  additions  to  the  average  TV  receiver.” 

TV  normally  fixes  the  horizontal  and  vertical  position  of  the  picture  on 
the  screen  by  sending  the  horizontal  position  pulses  and  the  vertical  position 
pulses  at  regular  intervals.  If  a transmitter  electronically  manipulated  these, 
the  image  would  become  displaced  on  the  screen.  Varying  the  manipulations 


833 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

would  shred  the  picture,  so  that  parts  normally  appearing  in  juxtaposition 
would  become  separated.  A nose  might  appear  to  the  right  of  an  eye,  an  ear 
below  a mouth.  Other  manipulations  would  “jitter”  the  image  like  a movie 
film  that  has  jumped  its  sprockets.  These  arrangements,  Kirk  wrote,  would 
“require  only  inexpensive  changes  in  the  position-circuits  of  the  receiver.” 

Various  pay-TV  companies  proposed  different  forms  of  the  keys  that  they 
would  sell  to  subscribers  to  enable  them  to  unscramble  the  program.  Skiatron 
Electronics  and  Television  Corporation  would  send  out  each  month  an 
I.B.M.  card  on  which  electric  circuits  would  be  imprinted.  The  subscriber 
would  insert  this  into  his  decoder,  which  could  then  reverse  that  month’s 
enciphering  key  to  reverse  the  two  basic  video  enciphering  processes  that 
Skiatron  would  use — shifting  the  horizontal  lines  to  one  of  three  different 
positions  and  inverting  the  video  signal.  It  would  also  decipher  the  audio 
scramble,  a band-shift.  Zenith  Radio  Corporation’s  decoder  had  five  key 
knobs,  each  of  which  had  seven  positions.  To  unscramble  a particular  pro- 
gram, a customer  would  have  to  set  his  decoder  knobs  to  one  of  the  1 6,000 
possible  positions.  And  to  prevent  one  person  from  buying  numbers  and 
furnishing  them  to  his  neighbors.  Zenith  would  wire  its  decoders  differently  so 
that  different  decoders  would  require  different  numbers  for  the  same  program. 
Zenith  would  encipher  its  video  in  essentially  the  same  way  as  Skiatron.  A 
third  system,  that  of  the  International  Telemeter  Corporation,  employed  a 
decoding  card  within  a coin-operated  device.  Holes  in  this  card,  which  was  to 
be  changed  monthly  at  the  same  time  coins  were  collected  from  the  decoder, 
permitted  electrical  contacts  to  make  circuits  that  unscramble  the  programs. 
More  recently,  Blonder-Tongue  Laboratories  and  Teleglobe  Pay-Television 
System  have  proposed  other  methods. 

Kirk  demonstrated  how  fee-vee  bootleggers  could  steal  the  keys  of  the 
three  systems.  In  each  case,  the  bootlegger  would  have  to  subscribe  legiti- 
mately to  the  system  to  get  the  unscrambling  information,  which  he  would 
then  use  to  break  the  system  and  peddle  the  results  to  nonsubscribers  at  a rate 
lower  than  subscribers  would  be  paying.  For  Skiatron,  he  could  sell  a card 
that  would  fit  into  the  decoder  and  would  contact  all  of  the  circuits;  switches 
attached  to  it  would  permit  shutting  the  circuits  on  or  off.  Then  he  would 
simply  translate  his  knowledge  of  the  current  key  into  settings  for  the  switches 
and  sell  the  settings.  For  Zenith,  all  the  decoders  would  have  to  be  able  to 
unscramble  the  same  signal,  even  though  the  knob  settings  would  be  different; 
the  bootlegger  could  quickly  correlate  the  setting  for  a knob  on  one  decoder 
with  the  setting  for  a knob  on  another  decoder  and  obtain  equivalences 
between  the  two  decoders.  To  sell  to  a particular  subscriber,  the  bootlegger 
would  merely  have  to  compare  a few  of  that  man’s  keys  with  his  own  keys 
for  the  same  period.  Telemeter’s  system  would  require  breaking  into  the 
decoder  to  copy  the  card. 

But  how  would  he  break  the  system  in  the  first  place?  Kirk  observed  that 
“for  successful  operation  of  a scrambled  television  system,  long-term  security 


834 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


— in  fact,  indefinite  security — is  mandatory.”  Yet,  “even  if  one  used  a very 
complex  coding  arrangement  and  delivered  the  coding  devices  only  into  hands 
of  those  people  who  made  adequate  payment  for  them,  this  would  represent 
only  short-term  security.  With  decoders  located  in  living  rooms  and  thousands 
of  technicians  (not  sworn  to  secrecy  as  in  the  military  case)  receiving  training, 
it  is  unlikely  that  a bootlegger  could  long  be  prevented  from  obtaining  a 
decoder  or  an  instruction  book  containing  circuit  information.  In  fact,  these 
technicians,  trained  at  the  expense  of  the  television  scramblers,  might  well 
become  the  first  bootleggers.”  Since  any  such  system  would  be  used  exten- 
sively, it  would  have  to  be  relatively  simple,  and  once  installed  on  millions  of 
TV  sets  it  naturally  could  not  be  changed  very  easily.  Moreover,  television 
transmits  at  a very  high  rate,  providing  an  enormous  volume  of  traffic  for 
solution.  TV’s  approximately  500  lines  per  picture  and  300  spots  per  line  make 
about  150,000  spots  of  light  per  picture;  Kirk  equated  the  25  levels  of  bright- 
ness with  the  26  letters  of  the  alphabet,  and  noted  that  30  pictures  are  sent 
per  second.  “This  corresponds  to  sending  4\  million  letters  per  second,  or  in 
terms  with  which  we  are  more  familiar,  some  900,000  words  per  second.  This 
is  the  equivalent  of  five  or  ten  books  per  second  in  terms  of  information 
transferred  by  letters.”  Finally,  the  TV  signals  are  very  highly  redundant.  The 
image  does  not  radically  change  every  one-thirtieth  of  a second;  usually  it 
stays  essentially  the  same.  The  only  television  picture  that  would  have  low 
redundancy  would  be  one  that  shows  grains  of  sand  of  various  shades  of 
black  and  white  blowing  across  the  screen : that  picture  would  change  from 
image  to  image. 

Kirk  contemptuously  dismissed  inversion  as  “not ...  a coding  procedure 
because  a simple  inverter  and  two-position  switch  is  all  that  is  needed”  to 
reinvert  it.  He  ignored  the  problem  of  finding  the  inversion  point,  but  that  is  a 
minor  problem.  Bars  across  the  picture  can  be  removed  by  examining  the 
voltage  of  the  video  wave  to  find  features — such  as  spurts  of  amplitude — 
“which  can  be  eliminated  to  bring  order  to  the  picture.”  Kirk  did  not  discuss 
solving  the  video  equivalent  of  band-splitting,  presumably  because  no  pay- 
TV  firm  proposed  such  a system,  and  he  also  did  not  discuss  a one-time 
system,  because  synchronization  problems  render  such  encipherments 
practicable  in  home  TV  sets  only  with  a wired  link  from  transmitter  to 
receiver  to  bring  in  the  key  pulses.  To  solve  shiftings  of  horizontal  lines 
involves  merely  electronically  comparing  the  frequencies  of  the  horizontal 
sweep  signals  with  the  frequencies  of  the  video  signals;  these  will  be  out  of 
phase  by  a fixed  number  corresponding  to  the  shift.  “Thus,”  Kirk  wrote,  “it 
may  well  be  possible  for  a bootlegger  to  build  a decoding  device  . . . which  . . . 
simply  utilizes  the  fact  that  the  encoding  process  at  the  transmitter  end  will 
insert  in  the  signal  a stop  phase  shift  which  can  be  detected  by  a phase 
detector  at  the  receiver  end.” 

The  most  general  question  involved  the  displaced  or  jiggled  image.  Kirk’s 
technique  resembles  the  speech-scrambler  solution  technique  of  recording  the 


835 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

scrambled  sounds  on  a spectrogram  and  then  matching  the  lines  as  in  a jig- 
saw puzzle  until  a smooth  flow  is  established. 

Assume  for  the  moment  that  the  television  signal  is  received,  and  instead  of 
being  displayed  on  a picture,  the  lines  of  the  picture  are  simply  recorded  on  a 
tape.  This  means  that  one  will  have  available  on  tape  the  series  of  lines  which 
contain  variations  in  intensity  from  black  to  all  shades  up  to  white.  These  lines 
will  be  received  in  the  order  that  they  are  supposed  to  come  in  the  picture.  The 
only  thing  that  is  out  of  order  is  that  the  edges  of  the  lines  don’t  match  up.  If 
one  matches  the  ends  of  these  lines,  then  the  picture  doesn’t  match  up. 

If  these  were  given  to  an  individual  with  the  requirement  that  he  sort  them 
out  to  make  a picture,  he  could  certainly  do  this  in  very  short  order.  He  would 
simply  look  for  the  like  looking  blobs  of  black  and  white  on  the  adjacent  lines 
and  then  match  these  up  by  shoving  one  first  a little  to  the  right  and  the  other  a 
little  to  the  left  as  necessary.  Very  shortly  he  would  have  the  completed  picture. . . . 

If  now  one  makes  an  electronic  circuit  which  can  control  the  horizontal 
position  of  the  picture  and  feeds  this  circuit  from  a computer  which  computes 
which  alignment  of  picture  elements  will  keep  things  on  adjacent  lines  most 
nearly  the  same,  the  result  will  be  a circuit  which  is  capable  of  electronically 
decoding  the  television  signal. 

Kirk’s  exposition  made  a very  strong  technical  case  against  the  security  of 
fee-vee.  Toll-TV  proponents  in  effect  conceded  this.  But  they  replied  on  the 
much  broader  and,  in  the  case  of  profit-seeking  firms,  the  controlling  ground 
of  economics. 

They  denied,  first,  Kirk’s  premise  that  “long-term  security ...  is  man- 
datory.” “Pay-television  systems  do  not  have  to  have  a cryptographic  security 
comparable  to  the  security  of  military  systems,”  wrote  William  C.  Rubin- 
stein, vice  president  of  Telemeter.  “After  all,  what  is  at  stake  is  merely  a 
sports  event  or  a movie.”  He  then  argued  that  the  relatively  low  security  of 
pay-TV’s  own  scrambles  sufficed. 

The  world  is  full  of  systems  which  function  satisfactorily  in  the  business 
world  but  which  have  no  more  security  than  the  most  rudimentary  secret 
television  system.  . . . Chewing  gum  and  peanuts  stand  in  glass  bowls  on  every 
street  corner  exposed  to  the  theft  of  any  little  boy  with  a brick.  . . . 

Obviously,  a criminal  organization  can  be  established  to  manufacture 
decoders  and  to  periodically  forge  code  cards.  Is  the  threat  of  such  criminal 
activity  serious?  It  sounds  to  me  much  easier  to  bootleg  liquor  instead  of  paying 
the  high  federal  tax  or  engaging  in  a large  variety  of  other  less  technically  com- 
plicated criminal  activities.  . . . 

What  about  the  genius  who  uses  correlation  techniques,  builds  a device  in  his 
garage,  etc.  ? We  figure  that  no  substantial  percentage  of  the  population  can  or 
will  do  this.  This  genius  probably  doesn't  want  to  watch  the  programs  anyhow. 
He  is  probably  too  busy  tinkering  in  his  garage. 

Finally,  the  pay-TV  proponent  said,  experience  backed  up  these  arguments. 
“In  Hartford,  Connecticut,  a cryptographic  pay-television  system  has  now 


836 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


operated  successfully  for  four  years.  The  RKO  General  Corporation  is  now 
expanding  the  system.  The  provisions  for  security  are  now  being  minimized 
because  it  has  become  obvious  that  there  is  no  security  problem  in  pay-tele- 
vision.  ...  I notice  that  the  Jerrold  organization,  although  it  has  had  four 
years  in  which  it  could  have  gotten  rich  by  building  bootleg  decoders  in 
Hartford,  has  done  nothing  along  these  lines.  Instead  it  has  proceeded  along 
making  a fortune  minding  its  own  business.” 

Nevertheless,  the  F.C.C.  has  not  yet  approved  either  televised  fee-vee  or 
Jerrold’s  wired  version.  The  real  reason  lies  in  an  economic  argument  that  is 
even  more  broadly  based  than  the  economic  argument  against  insecure 
scrambles.  This  is  that  the  American  public  prefers  free-vee. 

Despite  heady  flirtations  with  the  dark  attractions  of  secrecy,  business 
chose  the  dependably  beneficial  quality  of  economy  for  its  long-term  associa- 
tion with  codes.  In  that  association  lies  the  saga  of  the  nonsecret  code — a 
saga  that  is  now  all  but  ended. 

The  roots  of  the  nonsecret  code  reach  back  to  the  prearrangements  of 
signals  required  for  the  most  primitive  means  of  rapid  long-distance  com- 
munication. Tom-toms,  smoke  signals,  beacons  of  fire  at  night  work  only 
when  the  recipient  knows  what  the  signal-pattern  means.  These  prearrange- 
ments constitute  a code  in  the  sense  that  a language  is  a code;  their  purpose 
is  the  very  opposite  of  secrecy:  it  is  to  make  communication  possible,  not 
impossible.  Though  the  Romans  had  more  than  3,000  towers  for  fire  signals 
throughout  their  empire,  rapid  long-distance  communication  did  not  become 
available  for  business  until  1794,  when  Claude  Chappe  installed  an  “aerial 
telegraph”  from  Paris  to  Lille.  This  consisted  essentially  of  a semaphore 
system,  with  hilltop  towers  supporting  the  signal  apparatus.  A signal  was 
repeated  from  tower  to  tower,  and  in  good  visibility  would  cover  the  16 
stations  in  the  140  miles  from  Paris  to  Lille  in  two  minutes  and  the  1 16  stations 
from  Paris  to  Toulon  on  the  Mediterranean  in  20  minutes.  This  was  so  much 
faster  than  messengers  that  Chappe’s  system  spread  rapidly,  not  only  in 
France,  where  it  eventually  created  a network  of  534  stations  that  served  29 
towns,  but  in  other  countries  of  Europe. 

To  speed  up  transmission,  Chappe’s  cousin,  Leon  Delaunay,  made  up  a 
code  representing  10,000  expressions  by  one  to  four  figures.  After  using  this 
for  a while,  Chappe  devised  a more  efficient  code  in  which  92  of  the  sema- 
phore’s 196  positions  were  set  aside  as  code  positions.  Three  vocabularies, 
each  of  92  pages  with  92  expressions  on  each  page,  provided  a lexicon  of 
more  than  25,000  elements.  When  similar  lines  were  set  up  in  other  countries, 
similar  codes  sprang  up  and,  by  1825,  had  become  common.  In  1830,  Chappe 
expanded  his  code  by  assigning  184  semaphore  positions  to  code  use,  giving 
a code  of  almost  34,000  elements.  A Russian-language  code  appeared  in  St. 
Petersburg  in  1839  for  the  Chappe  network  between  that  capital  and  Kron- 
stadt and  Warsaw  that  helped  bridge  the  immense  distances  of  the  Russian 


837 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

empire.  In  1845  a rather  extensive  Telegraphic  Vocabulary  for  the  Line  of 
Semaphoric  Telegraphs  between  Liverpool  and  Holyhead  was  published  in 
London. 

At  about  the  same  time,  England  was  improving  maritime  signals.  During 
the  American  Revolution,  Admiral  Richard  Kempenfeldt  issued  the  first 
scientific  naval  signal  book,  which,  after  a struggle,  finally  established  itself 
in  the  Royal  Navy.  In  1817,  Captain  Frederick  Marryat  published  the  first 
international  code  of  signals,  in  which  colored  flags  represented  the  numbers

a page  of  one  of  the  vocabularies  for  Claude  Chappe' s “ aerial  telegraph," 
the  three-armed  semaphore's  two-position  signals  assigned  to  ships'  names 


of  words  listed  in  a 9,000-item  signal  book.  In  1857,  the  British  Board  of 
Trade  published  a draft  code  of  more  than  70,000  signals,  which  was  adopted 
by  many  seafaring  nations.  Hoists  of  colored  flags,  of  which  there  were  18, 
standing  for  all  consonants  but  x and  z,  represented  codewords  in  the  book, 
which  contained  words  and  expressions  used  by  sailors. 

In  1843,  the  first  public  electric  telegraph  line  had  been  laid  in  England, 
and  in  1844  Morse  established  the  first  public  telegraph  line  in  the  United 
States.  The  electric  telegraph,  much  faster  than  the  Chappe  semaphore,  and 
usable  in  night  and  rain  and  fog,  quickly  supplanted  the  older  system  and 
spread  very  quickly  through  Europe  and  America.  In  1845,  former  Maine

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Congressman  Francis  O.  J.  Smith,  then  39,  whom  Morse  had  taken  into 
partnership  in  the  hope  of  finding  in  Smith  the  business  acumen  that  artist 
Morse  himself  so  lacked,  published  his  The  Secret  Corresponding  Vocabulary: 
Adapted for  Use  to  Morse's  Electro-Magnetic  Telegraph,  the  first  code  intended 
for  the  electric  telegraph.  Smith,  a rather  unscrupulous  lawyer,  may  have 
gotten  the  idea  for  his  code  from  one  that  Morse  himself  had  compiled  but 
discarded.  The  1835  model  of  Morse’s  telegraph  transmitted  ten  symbols 
corresponding  to  the  ten  digits,  and  to  convey  words  by  means  of  them, 
Morse  spent  considerable  time  numbering  words  to  form  a special  vocabulary 
for  use  with  his  apparatus.  He  used  it  in  his  first  public  demonstration  of  his 
telegraph,  in  1837.  But  the  invention  of  what  is  now  the  Morse  code,  which 
permitted  the  direct  transmission  of  words  by  dots  and  dashes  without  the 
extra  step  of  encoding,  supervened  and  Morse  jettisoned  his  vocabulary. 

Smith’s  Vocabulary  and  one  compiled  at  about  the  same  time  by  Henry 
Rogers,  entitled  The  Telegraph  Dictionary  and  Seaman's  Signal  Book, 
Adapted  to  Signals  by  Flags  or  Other  Semaphores;  and  Arranged  for  Secret 
Correspondence,  Through  Morse's  Electro-magnetic  Telegraph,  both  emphas- 
ized secrecy.  But  although  businessmen  desire  secrecy  in  communication,  they 
demand  speed,  accuracy,  and  economy  before  it.  These  motives  soon  became 
paramount  in  the  public  telegraph  codes  that  followed  Smith’s  and  Rogers’, 
such  as  John  Wills’  Telegraphic  Congressional  Reporter  of  1847,  and 
in  the  private  codes  that  American  firms  began  to  improvise  as  early  as 
1848.  Their  lexicons  expanded  and  grew  richer  in  phrases.  And  since  groups 
of  figures  were  more  expensive  to  send  than  words  and  much  more  liable  to 
error — the  change  of  a single  digit,  which  in  the  Morse  code  could  result  from 
the  simple  dropping  of  a dot,  could  mean  an  entirely  different  word — the 
codes  shifted  to  the  use  of  regular  words  as  codewords.  Thus  cat  might  mean 
sell  and  dog,  buy.  By  1854,  one  eighth  of  the  telegrams  between  New  York 
and  New  Orleans  passed  in  code. 

In  1866,  the  laying  of  the  Atlantic  cable  gave  an  immense  impetus  to 
commercial  codes,  as  these  nonsecret  codes  came  to  be  called.  Cable  messages 
cost  so  much  that  the  reduction  in  length  made  possible  by  code  afforded 
enormous  economies.  Within  eight  years  there  appeared  the  first  edition  of 
the  first  public  code  destined  to  have  a wide  sale  and  a long  life,  The  ABC 
Code,  compiled  by  William  Clausen-Thue,  40  years  old,  a shipping  manager 
later  elected  a Fellow  of  the  Royal  Geographical  Society.  The  ABC  Code, 
which  went  through  many  editions,  probably  owed  its  success  to  its  enormous 
vocabulary,  which  represented  many  business  expressions  of  several  words  by 
a single  dictionary  codeword.  The  cable  companies  charged  for  codewords  as 
if  they  were  plain  language,  limiting  both  plain  and  codewords  to  a maximum 
of  seven  syllables. 

Codes  could  save  so  much  money  for  telegraph  and  cable  users  that,  it 
seemed,  everyone  who  ever  sent  a telegram  had  one.  In  1874,  the  Hebrew 
Orphan  Asylum  Printing  Establishment  issued  M.  Abenheim's  Telegraph- 


839 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

Code  for  Exclusive  Use  With  His  Correspondents.  Detwiller  & Street,  a fire- 
works firm,  had  its  own  20-page  Telegraphic  Chart,  with  some  appropriate 
codewords  ( mammoth  torpedoes,  3 case  = festival).  India’s  Department  of 
Revenue  and  Agriculture  had  its  325-page  Weather  and  Famine  Telegraphic 
Word-Code,  a two-part  code  (enveloppe  = Great  swarms  of  locusts  have 
appeared  and  ravaged  the  crops).  The  mackerel  industry  had  a 5-page  cable 
code  of  its  own  (abdic  = extra  quality,  very  fat  and  white),  and  so  did  the 
sausage  industry.  There  were  codes  for  tourists  and  the  press.  The  big  com- 
panies naturally  had  their  own  codes,  the  Erie  Railroad  Company  s running 
to  214  pages,  Swift  & Company’s  to  554  pages  (not  counting  the  364  pages  of 
the  separate  code  for  its  provision  department),  Lehman  Brothers’  to  two 
volumes.  Wells,  Fargo  & Company  prudently  did  not  supply  printed  a code- 
word for  the  plaintext  robbed,  evidently  preferring  to  fill  this  in  by  hand  to 
afford  some  secrecy. 

Among  the  great  code  compilers  of  this  era  were  John  Charles  Hartfield, 
who  published  The  Merchants  Code  of  15,000  dictionary  words  in  1877,  and 
followed  it  with  eleven  others  before  1890,  when  he  was  joined  by  his  son, 
John  W.  Hartfield,  in  the  business;  Henry  Harvey,  who  published  21  codes  or 
lists  of  codewords  between  1878  and  1899;  and  Benjamin  Franklin  Lieber, 
compiler  of  eight  codes,  one  of  them  becoming  widely  used  and  being  trans- 
lated into  French  and  German.  In  France  there  was  F.  J.  Sittler,  whose  four- 
digit code  sold  widely;  Bazeries  and  de  Viaris  published  codes  as  well.  Italy 
had  its  Baravelli.  These  Continental  codes,  mostly  numerical,  which  lent 
themselves  easily  to  superencipherment,  seemed  to  aim  quite  as  much  at 
secrecy  as  at  economy,  in  contradistinction  to  the  American  public  codes, 
which  emphasized  dictionary  words  as  affording  greater  savings  than  code- 
numbers. 

But  the  use  of  dictionary  words,  chosen  at  random,  of  varying  length  and 
irregular  construction  as  regards  placement  of  vowels  and  consonants,  and 
often  closely  resembling  one  another,  entrained  difficulties.  The  words  were 
subject  to  phonetic,  orthographic,  and  telegraphic  errors  which,  unlike  errors 
in  plain  language,  could  not  be  corrected  from  context.  For  example,  in 
codetexts  spoken  aloud,  as  they  were  in  the  days  when  the  mirror  galvano- 
meter served  in  cable  telegraphy  and  one  operator  watched  its  movements 
and  called  out  the  signals  to  an  operator  who  wrote  them  down,  codewords 
like  accept  and  except  or  serial  and  cereal  would  be  confused.  In  hand- 
written codetexts,  jeering  might  be  confused  with  peering,  or  morning  with 
moaning.  The  most  prolific  source  of  errors  came  from  the  telegraphic  trans- 
missions themselves.  A telegraph  company’s  records  showed  that  fully  half 
its  errors  stemmed  from  the  loss  of  a dot  in  transmission,  and  another  quarter 
by  the  insidious  false  spacing  of  signals.  These  errors  often  turned  one  word 
into  another.  For  example,  dropping  the  single  dot  that  represents  E would 
convert  the  French  verb  citerons  (“[we]  shall  point  out”)  to  the  French  word 
for  “lemons,”  citrons,  amending  might  become  attending  if  the  two  dashes

of  its  M sounded,  not  as  a single  letter,  but  as  two  separate  dashes  to  make  two 
t’s  (-).  With  two  spacing  errors  in  a single  word,  the  result  might  bear  almost 

no  similarity  to  the  original,  as  baneful  (-•••  •-  -•  • •-••)  might 

become  dutiful  (-•  • •• 

These  errors  sometimes  transmuted  a codeword  into  one  whose  decode 
made  sense,  or,  because  telegrams  were  often  only  partially  encoded,  into 
what  the  recipient  took  for  a plain-language  word.  When  the  recipients  acted 
upon  the  basis  of  this  erroneous  information,  financial  losses  sometimes 
ensued.  The  senders  of  the  messages  then  sued  the  telegraph  companies  to 
recover  these  losses,  on  the  ground  that  the  faulty  transmission  had  caused  the 
loss.  The  classic  case  went  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States. 

In  June  of  1887,  Frank  J.  Primrose,  a Philadelphia  wool  dealer,  sent 
William  B.  Toland  as  his  agent  out  to  Kansas  and  Colorado  with  instructions 
to  buy  50,000  pounds  of  wool  and  then  await  further  instructions.  Toland  did 
just  this,  exchanging  many  messages  with  Primrose  in  their  telegraphic  code 
during  the  course  of  his  buying.  On  June  16,  Primrose  encoded  the  following 
message  to  Toland : Yours  of  the  15th  received;  am  exceedingly  busy;  I have 
bought  all  kinds,  500,000  pounds;  perhaps  we  have  sold  half  of  it;  wire  when  you 
do  anything;  send  samples  immediately,  promptly  of  purchases.  He  wrote  out 
the  codetext  in  his  own  hand:  despot  am  exceedingly  busy  bay  all  kinds 
QUO  PERHAPS  BRACKEN  HALF  OF  IT  MINCE  MOMENT  PROMPTLY  OF  PURCHASES. 
He  gave  it  to  Western  Union,  which  transmitted  it  correctly  to  the  relay 
station  at  Brookville,  Kansas,  but  added  a dot  between  Brookville  and  Ellis, 
Kansas.  The  extra  dot  changed  the  a (•-)  of  bay  into  a u ( — ),  and  so  when 
the  message  reached  Toland  at  Waukeney,  instead  of  reading  the  I have 
bought  that  bay  represented,  he  interpreted  buy  as  another  plain-language 
word.  He  consequently  bought  300,000  pounds  of  wool.  Primrose,  in  settling 
with  the  sellers,  lost  more  than  $20,000  because  of  that  one  dot.  He  sued  the 
Western  Union  Telegraph  Company  for  this  amount,  on  the  ground  that  they 
had  been  negligent  in  performing  their  contract  with  him  to  transmit  the 
message  correctly.  But  the  Supreme  Court,  in  a 33-page  decision,  ruled  that 
Primrose  could  not  recover  more  than  the  cost  of  the  message,  as  the  terms 
printed  on  the  back  of  the  message  blank  stipulated,  because  he  had  not 
requested  that  the  message  be  repeated  back  to  him,  which  could  have  made 
Western  Union  liable.  The  telegram  had  cost  $1.15. 

Even  before  this  landmark  decision,  however,  code  compilers  had  begun 
to  recognize  the  danger  of  promiscuously  using  any  dictionary  words  as  code- 
words. They  employed  experienced  telegraphers  to  eliminate  words  tele- 
graphically too  similar.  They  deleted  words  that  might  make  sense  in  the 
business  in  which  the  code  was  used.  Most  important,  they  included  only 
words  that  differed  from  one  another  in  spelling  by  at  least  two  letters.  Thus, 
if  morning  were  admitted  to  the  code,  moaning,  which  differed  from  it  by 
only  one  letter,  would  not  be,  but  loaning,  which  differed  from  morning  by 
two  letters,  would  be.  This  principle  became  known  as  that  of  the  “two-letter 


t

differential.”  Finally,  although  eight  languages  were  allowed  in  cable  traffic, 
some  American  codemakers  deemed  foreign  words  too  hard  for  Americans 
to  spell  and  to  telegraph  and  struck  them  out  as  well.  All  these  restrictions 
so  limited  the  number  of  usable  words  that  code  compilers  made  up  code- 
words by  tacking  English  suffixes  onto  English  words,  even  though  the 
suffixes  made  no  sense.  For  example,  to  the  word  nigh,  one  code  added  49 
suffixes,  resulting  in  such  strange  neologisms  as  nighant,  nighbake,  nigh- 
cast,  and  so  on.  The  compilers  justified  these  on  the  very  practical  ground 
that  both  code  clerks  and  telegraphers  found  them  easier  to  handle  than 
many  legitimate  foreign  words,  such  as  aardmijten,  and  this  was  un- 
doubtedly true. 

These  were  among  the  first  artificial  codewords.  Others  were  created  by 
hooking  code  syllables,  each  with  a particular  meaning,  onto  dictionary 
words  to  modify  them.  In  one  such  code,  for  example,  the  syllable  fi  meant 
you  or  yours,  ti  meant  it,  mi  meant  me,  I,  or  mine,  zi  meant  they,  them,  theirs, 
and  so  on.  The  codeword  accesa  meant  What  do — advise — to  do  ? and  the 
addition  of  the  syllables  fi  and  zi,  making  the  codeword  accesafizi,  filled  in 
the  blanks  to  make  the  completed  plaintext  What  do  you  advise  them  to  do  ? 
Some  codes  provided  syllables  that  the  user  could  combine  into  an  entire 
artificial  codeword  that  included  several  ideas.  Usually  each  syllable  stood 
for  a variation  of  a particular  idea,  as  the  fi,  ti,  mi  . . . series  of  pronouns.  But 
the  syllable  systems  did  not  conform  to  the  principle  of  the  two-letter  differ- 
ential and,  the  dangers  of  transmission  error  rendering  such  systems  too  risky, 
code  compilers  moved  to  the  root-and-terminal  system.  Instead  of  just  using 
two-  or  three-letter  syllables,  they  provided  groups  of  four  or  five  letters  to 
indicate  different  ideas.  The  code  clerk  would  combine  two  of  these  into  a 
single  artificial  codeword.  For  example,  in  one  root-and-terminal  system,  the 
root  aparl  meant  We  order  1500  at  28  shillings,  the  terminal  anfro  meant 
140  jute  sacks  Duluth  Imperial,  net  c.i.f  London,  and  the  codeword  for  the 
entire  order  was  aparlanfro.  The  terminal  anere  changed  the  destination 
to  Liverpool. 

Still  another,  and  perhaps  the  most  voluminous,  source  of  artificial  code- 
words was  the  code  condenser.  A condenser  converts  figure  codegroups  into 
letter  groups,  usually  resembling  artificial  words.  Because  there  are  more  let- 
ters than  numbers,  it  is  possible  to  reduce  a seven-figure  group  to  a five-letter 
group  (265,  or  11,881,376,  being  greater  than  107,  or  10,000,000),  but  most 
condensers  reduce  only  six  figures  to  five  letters  because  they  want  to  retain  a 
certain  alternation  of  vowels  and  consonants  to  keep  its  letter  groups  pro- 
nounceable. Condensers  are  essentially  tables  of  letter-number  equivalents.  In 
one  condenser,  the  code  clerk  would  convert  the  group  484704  into  ilike  by 
finding  that  04  is  E on  the  first  page  of  the  condenser,  and,  using  the  tables  on 
that  page,  substituting  il  for  48  and  ik  for  47.  To  reverse  the  process,  he  deter- 
mines the  vowel-consonant  pattern  of  the  first  two  syllables.  Since  it  is  vowel- 
consonant,  vowel-consonant,  or  ucuc,  he  goes  to  the  first  page  and  reads  off 


842 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


the  equivalents.  If  the  combination  were  uccu,  the  codeword  would  have  been 
taken  from  the  second  page  and  accordingly  those  tables  would  have  been 
used,  if  cuuc,  the  third  page,  and  if  cucu,  the  fourth.  Condensers  offered 
several  advantages.  Words  usually  cost  less  to  cable  than  figures.  They  are 
less  subject  to  error.  Condensers  further  compress  messages — twelve  5-digit 
codegroups  could  be  reduced  to  ten  5-letter  codewords.  Moreover,  each  5- 
digit  codegroup  usually  has  counted  as  a single  cable  word,  while  for  code- 
words a 10-letter  group  usually  constituted  the  unit  of  charge.  This  would  cut 
the  toll  in  half.  A final  advantage  sacrificed  economy  for  accuracy.  To  ensure 
correct  reception,  code  clerks  would  add  up  the  five  digits  of  a codegroup  and 
tack  on  the  units  digit  of  the  result  as  a “check  digit.”  If  the  codegroup  was 
18250,  the  check  digit  would  become  6,  and  the  clerk  would  then  pass 
182506  through  his  condenser.  If  the  codeword  was  mutilated  in  transmission, 
the  failure  of  the  check  digit  to  confirm  the  total  would  alert  the  recipient  to 
the  error,  and  he  could  request  a retransmission. 

The  code  compilers  strove  constantly  to  find  new  ways  of  reducing  cable 
tolls  for  users — this  was,  after  all,  their  raison  d’etre.  Consequently,  many  of 
their  innovations  can  be  best  understood  as  efforts  to  circumvent  the  tariff 
regulations  of  the  International  Telegraph  Union,  to  which  most  of  the  nations 
of  Europe  belonged.  In  1875,  the  Union’s  conference  in  St.  Petersburg  re- 
duced the  maximum  length  of  a word  in  extra-European  traffic  from  seven 
syllables — a regulation  that  had  given  rise  to  considerable  abuses,  such  as 
chinesiskslutningsdon,  which  had  21  letters  but  only  six  syllables — to  ten 
letters.  Four  years  later,  the  London  conference  promulgated  two  regulations 
that  occasioned  innumerable  disputes,  which,  in  turn,  eventually  led  to  the 
creation  of  the  modern  commercial  code.  Article  8 of  the  convention  stated, 
in  part:  “In  the  extra-European  regime  code-language  telegrams  can  contain 
only  words  belonging  to  the  German,  English,  Spanish,  French,  Italian, 
Dutch,  Portuguese,  or  Latin  languages.  Every  telegram  can  contain  words 
taken  from  all  of  the  aforementioned  languages.”  Article  9 stated  that  “The 
following  are  considered  as  telegrams  in  cipher  language:  (a)  those  which 
contain  a text  in  figures  or  in  secret  letters ; (b)  those  which  include  either  series 
or  groups  of  figures  or  letters,  the  significance  of  which  is  not  known  to  the 
office  of  origin ; or  of  words  or  names,  or  of  groups  of  letters  not  complying 
with  the  conditions  for  plain  language  or  code  language.”  This  article  threw 
into  the  high-priced  category  of  cipher  language  all  the  systems  employing 
artificial  and  invented  words,  and  the  code-using  public  at  once  began  violat- 
ing it. 

But  though  the  counter  clerks  of  the  government-owned  communication 
monopolies  of  European  states  contested  these  evasions,  the  privately  owned 
cable  companies  did  not  fight  them  too  hard — for  if  they  did,  the  user  would 
simply  take  his  business  to  a more  complaisant  company.  This  tendency  was 
aggravated  by  the  fact  that  domestic  telegraph  companies  in  the  United 
States — which  did  not  adhere  to  the  International  Telegraph  Union — counted 


843 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

any  pronounceable  group  or  any  dictionary  word  as  a single  word.  American 
codes  had  come  to  use  these  artificial  groups,  and  American  users  saw  no 
reason  why  they  should  not  use  them  outside  the  United  States  just  as  they 
did  within.  Moreover,  the  telegraph  personnel  themselves  often  found  the 
artificial  words,  composed  as  they  were  of  fairly  regular  alternations  of  vowels 
and  consonants,  simpler  to  handle  than  the  clusters  of  consonants  sometimes 
found  in  English  or  German. 

To  end  the  increasing  number  of  abuses,  the  Union’s  Paris  conference  of 
1890  provided  for  an  official  code-language  vocabulary.  Within  Europe,  all 
code-language  words  would  have  to  come  from  this  vocabulary,  but  it  would 
be  optional  on  the  Europe-America  cables.  This  did  not  make  much  sense, 
since  nearly  all  the  abuses  occurred  in  the  transatlantic  traffic.  Nevertheless, 
the  International  Telegraph  Bureau,  the  secretariat  of  the  Union,  compiled 
the  vocabulary,  consisting  of  256,740  words  of  from  five  to  ten  letters  in  the 
eight  authorized  languages,  and  published  it  in  an  edition  of  15,000  copies  in 
1894.  It  met  with  a clamor  of  opposition,  primarily  because  it  would  even- 
tually outlaw  many  existing  codes  at  great  financial  loss.  So  the  Budapest 
conference  in  1896  authorized  the  Bureau  to  approve  or  disapprove  the  words 
in  existing  codes.  Submitted  were  218  codes,  containing  more  than  5,750,000 
codewords.  The  Bureau  actually  completed  its  herculean  task  and  published 
four  gigantic  volumes  in  1900  and  1901  with  1,174,864  words,  plus  a small 
appendix,  bringing  the  total  of  approved  words  to  1,190,000.  But  all  that  im- 
mense labor  went  for  nought.  The  London  conference  of  1903  dropped  the 
entire  idea  of  an  official  vocabulary,  and,  bowing  to  the  pressures  of  business 
and  to  common  sense,  authorized  the  use  of  artificial  words.  These  were  to  be 
“formed  of  syllables  capable  of  being  pronounced”  in  one  of  the  eight 
standard  languages  and  were  to  be  no  more  than  ten  letters  long.  The  Union 
had  in  mind  words  of  from  five  to  ten  letters  that,  by  alternations  of  vowels 
and  consonants,  would  resemble  real  words.  It  was  in  for  a shock. 

In  February  of  1904,  four  months  before  the  new  regulations  were  to  go 
into  effect,  there  appeared  in  England  Whitelaw' s Telegraph  Cyphers:  400 
Millions  of  Pronounceable  Words.  The  volume  consisted  of  20,000  codewords, 
or  “cyphers,”  all  of  five  letters  each — frean,  luffa,  forab,  lozoj — without 
phrases  attached  to  them.  Whence  the  400,000,000?  Since  the  maximum  per- 
missible length  of  codewords  was  ten  letters,  and  since  each  of  Whitelaw’s  five- 
letter  words  was  pronounceable,  any  one  could  be  combined  with  any  other 
one  in  a single  ten-letter  word,  making  20,000x20,000,  or  the  400,000,000. 
Through  this  loophole,  unforeseen  by  the  Union,  the  combining  of  two  code- 
words into  one  made  it  possible  to  halve  cable  tolls.  Whitelaw’s  gimmick  was 
immediately  adapted  by  many  private  firms.  In  1905  Ernest  Lungley  Bentley, 
45,  who  had  revised  the  private  code  of  a shipping  agency  where  he  was 
private  secretary  to  a partner,  founded  a code  company,  which  the  following 
year  published  the  compact,  well-constructed,  moderately  priced  Bentley  s 
Complete  Phrase  Code,  first  of  the  modern  five-letter  codes.  It  has  sold  well—

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


about  100,000  copies — and  remains  today  perhaps  the  best  known  and  most 
widely  used  of  commercial  codes.  Bentley,  a plump,  jovial  man  of  medium 
height,  who  had  a good  baritone  and  always  sang  in  the  choir  of  the  church 
he  attended,  including  St.  Paul’s  Cathedral’s  honorary  evening  choir,  saw  this 
success,  living  until  1939.  The  cut  in  cable  costs  that  the  five-letter  codes  made 
possible  led  to  an  upsurge  in  cable  traffic  and  inspired  the  publication  of 
many  new  codes.  Within  half  a decade,  the  new  five-letter  codes  had  swept  the 
dictionary-word  type  from  the  field. 

Eventually,  codes  were  compiled  for  virtually  every  industry  that  was  not 
strictly  local.  A list  of  even  some  of  them  suggests  the  incredible  diversity  of 
modern  commerce.  There  were  codes  for  automobile  dealers,  bankers, 
brokers,  canned  goods,  clothing,  coal,  coffee,  commission  merchants, 
cotton,  cottonseed,  dry  goods,  electric  supplies,  flour,  fruit,  fur,  grain,  gro- 
ceries, hay,  insurance,  iron  and  steel,  leather,  liquor,  livestock,  lumber, 
meat  packing,  mining,  oil,  papermaking,  phonographs,  potatoes,  produce, 
railroads,  rice,  rubber  goods,  the  sash-door-and-blinds  trade,  seeds,  ship 
brokers,  shipping,  sugar,  tailors,  textiles,  theaters,  ticket  brokers,  tobacco, 
transportation,  travelers,  vegetables,  wastes,  wool.  In  addition,  private  firms 
published  their  own  codes  in  the  fields  of  butter  and  cheese,  boots  and  shoes, 
cordage,  dentists’  supplies,  drugs,  elevators,  fire  insurance,  flaxseed,  harness, 
hides,  hops,  lead,  lime,  machinery,  millinery,  peanuts,  printing  ink,  smelting 
and  refining,  soap,  spices,  steam  and  gas  fittings,  steam  engines,  steamboats, 
suretyship  and  guaranty,  tanning,  tea,  wagons,  and  yarn. 

To  open  these  books  is  to  feel  the  life  pulse  of  the  business.  The  Waste 
Merchant's  Standard  Code  offers  a consignment  of  cast  iron  scrap,  excessively 
rusty  with  iqua.  Using  Tilton  s Income  Tax  Code,  the  taxpayer  declares  firmly 
mirasol  for  I (we)  will  not  pay — and  the  tax  advisor  retorts  promptly  NASA

bound  to  resemble  a law  book.  A U.S.  immigration  agent,  using  the  Tele- 
graphic Code  of  the  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service,  embarrassedly 
telegraphs  his  chief  gaxew  (.  . . Escaped  after  being  placed  on  shipboard  for

Code  to  sadly  report  to  his  home  church  that  (Mission) property  (at ) has 

been  destroyed , and  then  adds  a hopeful  swamk  (Join  us  in  prayer  for  funds). 
Sometimes  the  codebooks  reveal  not  just  the  life  of  an  organization  or  indus- 
try, but  also  its  very  soul.  Thus  the  Cinema-code  of  1923  has  under  the 
heading  Picture : is  a charming  love  story  = epwcy,  is  a classic  production  = 
epwmi,  is  a country  life  drama  = epwok.  is  a detective  story  = epwso,  . . . is 
a marvelous,  vivid  drama  = epxox,  is  a spectacular  production  — epxud. 
But  even  the  Hollywood  fairyland  met  with  brutal  reality  at  times,  and  the 
compiler,  Richard  Poillon,  felt  compelled  to  include  epxir  (is  a great 
disappointment).

Rumrunners , Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

In  the  1920s,  the  explosion  of  international  commerce  that  had  been 
bottled  up  by  the  World  War  created  the  golden  age  of  the  commercial  code. 
More  codes  were  produced  in  the  five  or  six  years  after  the  war  than  in  the  20 
years  before  it.  Many  of  the  great  commercial  codes  date  from  this  era — the 
ABC  6th  edition,  the  Acme,  the  Boe,  Farquhar's,  the  Lombard,  the  Rudolf 
Mosse,  Peterson  s,  the  United  Telegraph,  the  Western  Union.  They  were  large 
tomes  of  hundreds  or  even  a thousand  pages,  comparing  favorably  in  pound- 
age with  a Webster’s  Unabridged,  and  costing  in  the  neighborhood  of  $25. 
Many  of  the  codes  of  this  period  were  produced  by  the  world’s  handful  of 
code  compilers,  nearly  all  Americans,  representing  the  second  generation  of 
workers  in  this  recondite  field:  John  C.  Hartfield,  son  of  John  W.  Hartfield, 
C.  Bensinger,  Ernest  F.  Peterson,  Thomas  C.  Wilwerth,  Cyrus  F.  Tibbals, 
Cosmo  Farquhar,  and  William  J.  Mitchel.  At  least  two  made  fortunes — 
Peterson  and  Tibbals.

A trilingual  commercial  code:  The  Marconi  International  Code 


New  York  was  the  world  center  of  commercial  code  activity  because  com- 
mercial codes  served  mainly  in  cables  between  Europe  and  America.  English 
was  the  language  of  most  codes,  not  only  because  it  has  always  been  the  lan- 
guage of  commerce  but  because  most  messages  went  to  America.  To  cross 
language  barriers,  some  codes,  such  as  Bentley’s  and  Fieber’s,  were  translated 
into  other  languages;  some  were  bilingual.  Marconi’s  Wireless  Telegraph 
Company  Fimited  made  a supreme  effort  in  this  field:  its  code,  compiled  by 
James  C.  H.  Macbeth,  a quiet,  blue-eyed  Scot  in  his  early  thirties  who  had 
become  interested  in  codes  while  in  business  in  Malaya,  encompassed  nine 
languages — English,  Dutch,  French,  German,  Italian,  Japanese,  Portuguese, 
Russian,  and  Spanish.  Each  of  its  four  massive  volumes  contained  three  lan- 
guages, one  of  which  was  always  English.  The  eight  other  languages  had  in- 
dices referring  to  the  place  in  the  code,  which  was  arranged  according  to  the 
English  word-sequence,  where  a particular  expression  would  be  found.  It  was 
to  serve  as  a kind  of  automatic  translator.  An  American  would  encode  the

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


word  a or  an  as  ababa,  and  a Frenchman,  receiving  that  codeword,  would 
decode  it  as  un  or  me.  This  sort  of  thing  can  be  done  with  code  because  code 
operates  upon  linguistic  entities.  The  idea  stands  in  the  line  of  great  efforts 
to  create  a universal  language,  and  in  1663,  in  fact,  Athanasius  Kircher  com- 
piled a Marconi-like  code  of  1,048  words  from  each  of  five  languages,  the 
coded  version  to  serve  as  an  international  language. 

The  only  one  of  these  proposals  that  seems  ever  to  have  worked  is  the 
International  Code  of  Signals.  The  1857  British  Board  of  Trade  code  was  im- 
proved by  a conference  in  Washington  in  1889  and  distributed  to  maritime 
powers  in  1897,  enabling  a ship  of  one  nation  to  hoist  flags  which  would  be 
read  by  a ship  of  another  nation  in  its  own  language  by  virtue  of  a codebook 
in  that  language.  The  International  Radiotelegraph  Conference  of  Washing- 
ton in  1927  agreed  that  two  codes,  one  visual,  one  radio,  should  be  compiled. 
The  editorial  committee  assembled  in  London  in  October,  1928,  and  completed 
its  work  in  December,  1930.  Several  nations  published  the  codes  in  English, 
French,  German,  Italian,  Japanese,  Spanish,  and  Norwegian  editions.  The 
visual  code  employs  colored  flags — u is  quartered  red  and  white,  G has  vertical 
yellow  and  blue  bars — to  represent  the  letters  of  the  codewords.  One-letter 
codewords  stand  for  urgent  signals:  G = / require  a pilot',  U = You  are 
standing  into  danger.  The  same  flags  have  the  same  meanings  in  the  other 
languages.  Two-letter  signals  are  for  distress  and  maneuvering  (ap  = I am 
aground),  three-letter  for  words,  phrases,  and  sentences,  four-letter  for 
geographical  expressions  and  for  the  signal  letters  of  ships.  The  radiotele- 
graph code  uses  five-letter  groups.  Both  codes  are  universally  employed. 

The  International  Code  of  Signals  has  succeeded  because  it  fills  a need: 
mutually  intelligible  signals  among  crews  speaking  different  languages  are 
essential  on  the  sea.  But  it  faced  no  competition.  Among  the  great  variety  of 
commercial  codes,  any  of  which  could  have  filled  the  need  for  cutting  cable 
tolls,  why  do  some  succeed  and  some  fail  ? There  appear  to  be  two  reasons,  one 
intrinsic,  the  other  extrinsic. 

The  extrinsic  factor  is  the  salesmanship  of  the  compiler,  and  this  often 
outweighs  all  else.  The  Acme  Code  succeeded  commercially  because  its  com- 
piler, William  J.  Mitchel,  was  a convincing  salesman,  whereas  the  Universal 
Trade  Code  of  Yardley  and  Mendelsohn,  intrinsically  about  as  good  a code, 
never  sold  well  because  its  compilers,  busy  with  other  matters,  never  pushed 
it.  The  intrinsic  factor,  or  the  quality  of  the  code,  refers  primarily  to  its  con- 
densing power:  how  many  plain-language  words  are  represented  by  a single 
five-letter  codeword.  The  later  codes  average  a condensing  power  of  between 
5:1  and  10:1,  which  means  that  they  reduce  messages  to  one  fifth  or  one 
tenth  of  their  plain-language  length.  The  ratio  depends,  of  course,  upon  the 
vocabulary.  How,  then,  is  a vocabulary  constructed? 

“By  reading  telegrams,”  said  Mitchel,  who  has  compiled  not  only  the 
public  Acme  Code  but  also  many  private  ones.  The  code  compiler  must  read 
thousands  of  business  telegrams  to  get  the  most-used  phrases,  which  he  writes 


847 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

out  on  slips  of  paper.  These  not  only  give  him  specific  entries  for  his  code,  but 
also  suggest  others,  in  the  manner  described  in  the  1930s  by  John  W.  Hart- 
field: 

I had  a great  mass  of  material  accumulated  from  years  past,  different  codes, 
and  gleanings  of  suggestions  made  by  different  people  and  so  forth.  I took  these 
and  made  notes  of  them  on  sheets  of  paper,  writing  phrases  on  sheets  of  paper. 
As  I wrote  phrases,  other  phrases  suggested  themselves  and  I interpolated  those. 
I read  the  phrases  and  as  I read  them,  other  phrases  suggested  themselves  and  I 
wrote  those.  Then  I rewrote  them  into  alphabetical  sequence,  and  as  I rewrote 
them  into  alphabetical  sequence  other  phrases  suggested  themselves,  and  those  I 
interpolated.  Then  I went  through  this  different  data  I had  and  made  further 
additions,  kept  on  enlarging  various  subjects.  Some  people  suggested  to  me  that 
the  subjects  in  my  1905  book  were  not  adequate  and  should  be  improved  upon. 
These  subjects  I enlarged,  amplified. 

And  so  the  books  grew. 

Larger  codes  usually  have  a greater  condensing  power  than  small  ones 
because  they  can  include  many  long  phrases,  some  with  20  or  30  words.  But 
more  important  than  size  is  how  well  a code’s  phraseology  accords  with 
business  usage.  Thus  Cyrus  Tibbals’  Western  Union  Code,  whose  300,000 
equivalents  make  it  probably  the  largest  commercial  code  ever  compiled, 
did  not  afford  as  much  economy  as  the  100,000-codeword  Acme  Code  because 
its  vocabulary  was  not  as  good.  Business  firms  compared  codes  by  using  them 
in  their  cables  to  see  which  saved  more  money  before  investing  several  hun- 
dreds or  thousands  of  dollars  in  buying  scores  of  copies  of  a code  for  their 
offices  around  the  world.  Many  companies  had  private  codes  compiled  in 
which  their  products  are  listed  in  great  detail.  Though  this  may  cost  a large 
firm  up  to  $50,000  (including  printing),  they  soon  recover  that  amount  in 
their  cable  toll  savings;  they  also  get  a dividend  of  secrecy,  which  is  sometimes 
important. 

Up  to  the  mid-1920s,  the  codewords  of  a code  did  not  affect  its  quality 
very  much,  since  all  included  the  two-letter  differential.  Then  Mitchel  intro- 
duced a new  safeguard  in  his  Acme  Code : no  codeword  was  included  if  it 
could  be  formed  from  an  already  existing  codeword  by  the  transposition  of 
two  adjacent  letters.  Thus,  if  the  code  included  labed,  excluded  would  be 
albed,  lbaed,  laebd,  and  labde.  Since  such  transpositions  are  not  at  all 
rare  in  communication,  both  code  and  plain,  resulting  usually  from  psycho- 
logical rather  than  telegraphic  slips,  Mitchel's  idea  spread  rapidly. 

To  generate  the  enormous  quantities  of  codewords  needed,  compilers 
used  construction  tables.  For  five-letter  codes,  these  consisted  of  a square  of 
single  letters  with  two  squares  of  letter-pairs  adjoining  it,  one  at  the  top  and 
one  at  the  side.  The  letter  pairs  were  so  chosen  and  arranged  that  all  in  a 
given  column  or  row  in  a square  differed  by  two  letters  from  one  another.  To 
keep  the  codeword  stock  free  of  transpositions  of  adjacent  letters,  the  squares 
must  have  an  odd  number  of  cells  on  each  side.  Since  the  normal  alphabet  has

26  letters,  this  can  be  done  either  by  dropping  one  letter  or  by  adding  an 
extra  character  and  then  eliminating  from  the  code  stock  all  words  formed 
with  it ; the  latter  procedure,  which  saves  the  26th  letter,  naturally  produces 
more  codewords.  A miniature  codeword  construction  table,  based  on  the  six- 
letter  alphabet,  a,  b,  c,  d,  e,  and  f,  with  f as  the  extra  character,  can  demon- 
strate the  procedure :

codewords,  the  compiler  takes 

two 

elements 

from  the  same 

column  and  two  elements  from  the  same  row,  with  the  single  letter  at  the 
pivot  of  the  column  and  row.  Thus,  the  codeword  series  would  run  aaaaa, 
AAABB,  AAACC,  . . . AAAff,  AABBA,  AABCB  . . . , AAfFf,  ABBAA,  ABBBB  . . . , 
ABBff,  ABCBA  . . . , AfFFt,  BBBBA,  BBBCB,  BBBDC  ....  These  Words  all 
show  a 2-letter  difference  and  exclude  alternate-letter  transpositions.  The 
number  of  5-letter  codewords  using  a 26-letter  alphabet  showing  a simple  2- 
letter  differential  is  264,  or  456,976.  The  alternate-letter  restriction  lowers 
this  to  440,051  codewords  constructed  with  a 27-character  alphabet,  or 
390,625  if  constructed  with  a 25-letter  alphabet.  These  are  theoretical  maxi- 
mums,  however,  and  although  some  cryptologists,  notably  Friedman, 
Mendelsohn,  and  Schauffler,  have  used  mathematics  to  examine  the  best  ways 
of  constructing  stocks  of  codewords,  “most  codemakers,”  Schauffler  has 
written,  “are  pure  empiricists”  and  “many  an  inelegant  solution”  robs  them 
of  usable  codewords.  But  what  deprived  the  code  compilers  of  the  greatest 
number  of  codewords  was  the  International  Telegraph  Union  rule  that  the 
words  be  pronounceable.  This  slashed  the  number  available  from  about 
400,000  to  about  100,000. 

The  pronounceability  rule  consequently  became  increasingly  unpopular 
during  the  code-boom  period  of  the  early  1920s.  It  restricted  the  size  of  codes 
when  they  were  bursting  at  the  seams.  It  caused  innumerable  arguments  at  the 
telegraph  counters.  It  engendered  disputes  between  the  cable  companies  and 


849 


Rumrunners,  Businessmen,  and  Makers  of  Nonsecret  Codes 

the  governmental  telegraph  administrations.  So  the  1925  Paris  conference  of  the 
International  Telegraph  Union  sent  the  entire  codeword  question  to  a special 
15-delegate  committee,  which  met  for  a month  in  1926  at  the  resort  town  of 
Cortina  d’Ampezzo,  Italy.  It  scrutinized  the  answers  to  questionnaires  it  had 
sent  out,  read  the  comments  submitted  to  it  by  operators  and  users  and  code 
compilers,  discussed  the  problem,  and  decided  (all  but  the  British  delegation) 
to  recommend  to  the  next  conference  that  “Code  words  must  be  formed  of  a 
maximum  of  five  letters,  chosen  at  the  will  of  the  sender,  without  any  con- 
dition.” But  the  1928  Brussels  conference  ignored  this  recommendation.  It 
sought  instead  to  quantify  pronounceability  by  requiring  that  all  codewords 
of  ten  letters  have  at  least  three  vowels.  The  rule  ran  into  strong  opposition, 
and  finally,  at  Madrid  in  1932,  what  had  become  the  International  Telecom- 
munications Union  at  long  last  abandoned  any  effort  to  legislate  the  nature 
of  codewords  and  acceded,  in  effect,  to  the  Cortina  proposal.  Much  of  the 
rationale  for  pronounceability  was  dissolving  with  the  introduction  of  tele- 
typewriters into  the  cable  circuits.  The  sound  of  the  codewords  may  have 
mattered  to  the  Morse-code  operators  who  listened  to  the  signals  of  the  Morse 
sounder;  it  did  not  matter  to  touch  typists.  What  did  matter  was  that  the  code- 
words became  five  letters  long  instead  of  ten.  The  teletypist  could  now  take 
in  and  remember  a word  at  a single  glance,  which  he  could  not  do  with  the 
artificial  ten-letter  words,  even  if  they  were  pronounceable,  without  a fair  pro- 
portion of  errors.  The  new  regulations  thus  speeded  transmission  and  reduced 
errors. 

Simultaneously,  the  number  of  permissible  codewords  bounded  upward. 
This  did  not  mean  much  in  most  public  codes,  where  codes  of  50,000  to  1 00,000 
elements  are  the  largest  practicable,  since  beyond  that  size  no  code  clerk  takes 
the  time  to  search  out  the  most  precise  and  economical  phrase.  But  in  private 
codes  the  many  new  codewords  were  very  advantageously  employed.  When 
Ernest  F.  Peterson  revised  a cash  register  company’s  100,000-word  code,  he 
found  that  1,000  words  in  the  old  code,  from  kajan  to  kutaz,  conveyed 
shipping  instructions.  Thus,  kubor  meant  We  are  shipping  to  you,  in  care  of 
your  agent  at  Shanghai.  The  description  of  the  machine  had  to  go  into  the 
next  codeword.  Taking  advantage  of  the  new  wealth  of  codewords,  Peterson 
combined  each  of  the  10,000  shipping  instructions  with  each  of  the  firm’s  200 
models  of  cash  registers,  and  assigned  each  a codeword.  This  used  200,000 
words,  or  twice  as  many  as  the  old  code  had  had  altogether.  But  it  saved  a 
cable  word,  and  when  Peterson  finished  making  similar  changes  elsewhere, 
the  code  could  express  common  transactions  that  had  formerly  required  four 
five-letter  codewords  in  just  two,  greatly  lowering  the  firm’s  cable  bill.  Simi- 
larly, he  expanded  a bank’s  code  from  100,000  to  400,000  words. 

Such  savings  were  important  in  the  Depression,  and  commercial  codes 
were  widely  used — though  the  code  compilers  suffered  as  much  from  the 
economic  slump  as  the  rest  of  the  business  world.  World  War  II,  whose 
numerous  national  censorships  frowned  on  codes  and  limited  the  number  of 


850 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


permitted  ones,  dealt  the  code  business  a severe  blow.  And  after  the  war,  the 
rising  cost  of  labor  dealt  it  a mortal  one.  It  often  cost  more  to  have  a clerk 
code  a message  than  the  coding  would  save  in  cable  tolls.  At  the  same  time, 
the  greater  ease  of  international  communications  militated  against  the  use  of 
codes.  Sending  a cable  message  once  involved  a mystique  of  writing  it  out  on 
a blank  in  telegraphic  English  and  having  a messenger  take  it  down  to  the 
cable  office,  a dramatic  place  where  men  could  touch  a key  and  make  some- 
thing go  “click”  in  Europe,  a week  away  by  boat.  Codes  and  coding  were  part 
of  this  mystique.  But  when  business  firms  installed  teletypewriters  that  could 
be  linked  directly  to  the  cablehead,  or  even  to  a firm’s  European  branch,  it 
became  simpler  just  to  sit  down  at  the  keyboard  and  type  out  the  message 
without  bothering  with  the  whole  rigamarole  of  coding.  Transatlantic  tele- 
phone calls  and  letters  by  jet,  which  leave  London  one  day  and  arrive  in  New 
York  the  next,  stole  business  from  the  cables  and  reduced  the  need  for  codes. 

At  the  same  time,  the  march  of  progress  was  making  codes  less  and  less 
useful.  For  a code  once  compiled  does  not  retain  its  value  forever.  A code 
reflects  the  world  at  a particular  instant,  and  as  the  world  moves  on  it  out- 
modes  the  code.  New  products,  new  ways  of  doing  things,  new  political  or 
economic  facts  begin  to  make  its  vocabulary  old-fashioned.  No  codes  com- 
piled in  the  1920s  or  1930s  had  any  phrases  referring  to  transatlantic  air  travel, 
yet  cable  traffic  today  is  replete  with  such  references.  Ironically,  the  better  a 
code  is  at  the  moment  of  its  compilation,  the  more  closely  its  vocabulary  fits 
the  business  requirements  of  its  time,  the  more  rapidly  will  it  obsolesce.  Of 
course  many  phrases  will  remain  viable,  but  the  lack  of  many  badly  needed 
phrases  renders  the  code  as  a whole  almost  useless.  Why  bother  to  encode  at 
all  if  half  the  message  has  to  be  sent  in  plain  anyway? 

Thus  the  use  of  code  fell  off  drastically  after  World  War  II.  Many  com- 
panies resorted  to  code  only  when  they  needed  a modicum  of  secrecy — a 
return,  at  the  moment  of  the  commercial  code’s  death,  to  the  motive  advanced 
as  its  main  reason  for  being  at  the  moment  of  its  birth.  Today  only  com- 
modity exchanges  use  commercial  codes  extensively  (for  economy,  not 
secrecy).  Old  codes  are  still  reprinted  and  sold,  but  the  printings  have  dropped 
in  size.  Only  a handful  of  commercial  codes — probably  all  private — were 
compiled  in  the  1 950s,  and  it  is  almost  certain  that  since  1 960  not  one  has  been. 
There  is  today  not  a single  practicing  code  compiler  in  the  United  States,  and 
probably  not  one  in  the  world. 

Even  an  injection  of  the  wonder  drug  of  modern  business — the  electronic 
computer — failed  to  stem  the  decline.  Robert  W.  Berner  of  I.B.M.  proposed 
placing  a business  vocabulary  in  a computer  memory  and  assigning  digital 
“codewords”  to  its  words  and  phrases  on  the  basis  of  frequency — shorter 
groups  of  digits  for  the  common  phrases,  longer  groups  for  the  less  used  ones. 
The  computer  would  automatically  encode  the  message.  Berner  called  the  idea 
“digital  shorthand”  and  found  that  it  would  compress  a message  to  one  third 
its  normal  length,  thereby  in  effect  tripling  the  capacity  of  a communications

link.  But  though  the  method  was  technically  feasible,  economically  it  never 
got  off  the  ground,  and  the  code  business  remained  moribund. 

The  rise  and  fall  of  an  industry  is  not  a new  story  in  the  history  of  the 
world.  As  a business,  the  making  of  nonsecret  codes  is  as  dead  as  armor 
making  or  buggy-whip  making.  Did  it  have  any  aftereffect  on  civilization, 
after  fulfilling  its  function  of  helping  that  civilization  advance?  Did  it  leave 
anything  beyond  hundreds  of  dusty  tomes  filled  with  outmoded  references  to 
ships  being  coaled  and  defunct  names  like  St.  Petersburg,  and  some  lessons  in 
codeword  construction?  There  is  one  thing  that  may  be  distilled  from  any 
human  experience  because  it  represents  the  universal,  and  that  is  art.  Com- 
mercial codemaking  stimulated  the  best  humor  in  cryptology — a small  con- 
tribution to  the  world’s  store  of  art,  but  one  that  gives  lasting  pleasure  none- 
theless. The  author,  Jack  Littlefield,  offered  some  “Melancholy  Notes  on  a 
Cablegram  Code  Book”  to  the  readers  of  the  July  28,  1934,  issue  of  The  New 
Yorker* — the  code  in  question  being  the  Acme. 

Every  time  I receive  a cablegram  in  code,  I have  the  same  feeling  of  pleasure- 
able  excitement.  There  is  the  familiar  envelope  lying  on  my  desk,  marked  “Cable- 
gram: Urgent.”  I rip  it  open  and  discover  inside  the  single  mysterious  word 
biinc.  The  message  is  from  our  Venezuela  office.  Visions  at  once  loom  of  secret 
documents,  beautiful  women,  and  dark  Latin-American  intrigue.  Then  1 turn 
to  my  code  book  and  find  biinc:  What  appliances  have  you  for  lifting  heavy 
machinery?  This  sort  of  thing  can  be  very  debilitating. 

It  is  not  the  fault  of  the  code  book,  either.  That  handy  volume  is  full  of 
interesting  messages  that  my  correspondents  never  seem  to  get  around  to  sending. 
For  years  I have  been  on  the  watch  for  wires  like  narvo  {Do  not  part  with  the 
documents),  obnyx  {Escape  at  once),  arpuk  {The  person  is  an  adventurer,  have 
nothing  to  do  with  him),  or  buksi  {Avoid arrest  if possible),  but  they  never  seem  to 
arrive.  And  yet,  if  the  code  book  is  to  be  believed,  they  are  fair  samples  of  the 
kind  of  thing  with  which  our  telegraph  wires  are  humming  daily. 

Not  all  the  code-book  suggestions,  of  course,  are  on  this  high  level  of  ad- 
venture. Our  telegraph-users,  it  would  seem,  have  a wide  range  of  concerns.  At 
this  very  moment  a perplexed  customer  in  some  distant  part  of  the  globe  is  inquir- 
ing urpxo  (For  what  use  was  the  mixing  machine  intended?)',  in  the  next  town, 
perhaps  a ship’s  captain  is  reporting  diffidently  eljaz  (Will  have  to  get  bottom 
examined  before  proceeding)',  while  somewhere  a new  parent  is  voicing  his  elation 
in  the  form  of  arojd  (Please  advertise  the  birth  of  twins). 

The  dominating  note  cf  the  code  book,  however,  is  one  of  resigned  melan- 
choly. Its  pages  are  replete  with  such  gloomy  sentiments  as  zular  (Unfortunately 
too  true)  and  culke  (Bad  as  possibly  can  be),  expressions  that  seem  only  too 
justified  when  we  consider  the  extraordinary  series  of  disasters  that  has  been 
stored  up  for  users  of  the  code.  Every  possible  variety  of  mishap  has  been  fore- 
seen and  embalmed  in  a group  of  doleful  entries  ranging  from  the  comparatively 
trivial  aibuk,  which  describes  the  bursting  of  a donkey  boiler,  to  the  truly  cata- 
clysmic pytuo  (Collided  with  an  iceberg).  Even  the  usually  trustworthy  mail  and

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


express  services  share  in  the  general  debacle.  Our  very  letters,  it  is  predicted,  will 
be  unreadable , the  writing  having  been  obliterated  by  water  (skaae)  ; and  shipments 
will  inevitably  arrive  in  clammy  condition  (hehst).  It  is  all  very  sad. 

Nor  is  the  code  book  a volume  to  be  recommended  for  shipboard  reading. 
Never  frolicsome,  it  is  at  its  gloomy  best  when  describing  sea  accidents.  This  it 
does  not  only  with  gusto  but  with  an  unpleasantly  convincing  eye  for  detail. 
Listings  like  lyadi,  for  example  ( Arrived  here  with  decks  swept,  boats  and  funnel 
carried  away,  cargo  shifted,  having  encountered  a hurricane),  are  just  circumstan- 
tial enough  to  be  a trifle  discommoding  to  the  ocean-traveller.  And  when,  a few 
pages  farther  on,  he  encounters  the  still  more  ominous  uzshy  ( Body  now  lies  in 
the  mortuary),  he  cannot  help  feeling  an  awful  assurance  as  to  the  identity  of  the 
corpse  in  question. 

Then,  too,  there  is  the  matter  of  the  ship’s  captain,  that  dignitary  whom  we 
are  accustomed  to  think  of  as  a strong,  silent  man — alert,  commanding,  and 
always  on  the  job.  The  code-book  picture  of  him  is  different  and  more  than  a 
little  disconcerting.  By  the  time  we  have  finished  reading  messages  like  Captain 
lost  overboard.  Captain  not  to  be  found.  Captain  drunk,  Captain  refuses  to  leave 
vessel,  and  Captain  insane,  it  is  with  considerable  relief  that  we  light  upon  the 
entry  Arrest  the  Captain.  It  would  seem  to  have  come  not  a moment  too  soon. 

But  even  if  the  captain  avoids  these  pitfalls,  and  the  ship  itself  escapes  the 
ravages  of  the  storm,  the  code  has  still  other  hazards  in  store  for  the  unhappy 
voyager.  At  any  moment  the  ship  may  be  captured  by  pirates  (enimp)  or  plundered 
by  natives  (ybdig).  There  is  always  the  chance  that  the  captain  will  receive  cabled 
instructions  to  arrest  all  passengers  (zeibi).  Even  less  consoling  to  the  prospective 
traveller  are  such  glimpses  of  world  hygiene  as  iddog  (Ship  in  port,  all  hands  down 
with  scurvy)  and  oavug  (An  epidemic  of  foot-and-mouth  disease  has  broken  out 
here).  The  only  ray  of  light  is  provided  by  ewixi  ( Very  few  cases  of  cholera  are  now 
reported),  and  even  that  statement  is  not  without  its  depressing  implications. 

There  is  no  denying,  however,  that  the  code  book  is  full  of  helpful  informa- 
tion. Should  you  ever,  for  example,  feel  the  need  of  lard,  in  bladders,  the  word  is 
choog.  Flannel  shirts  are  golpo.  Cod-liver  oil  is  called  gahgu — and  a very  good 
word  for  it,  too,  as  is  foolp  for  ship’s  biscuit.  A niblick  is,  of  course,  a gazeb, 
but  the  word  for  foot-warmer  is  freiz.  No  matter  what  commodity  it  is  you  desire, 
you  will  find  it  covered  in  the  code,  which  includes  a list  of  nearly  a thousand 
necessities  of  life,  ranging  all  the  way  from  arsenic  to  ostrich  feathers,  from  blast- 
ing charges  to  porch  umbrellas.  Even  the  commodities,  however,  are  blighted  by 
the  same  spirit  of  melancholy  that  pervades  the  entire  code,  and  the  result  is  such 
decadent  listings  as  zokix  ( unhealthy  trees)  and  gnuek  ( rubber , slightly  moldy). 

But  it  is  in  its  cross-references  that  the  code  book  reaches  the  logical  limits  of 
pessimism.  For  gratuitous  gloom,  it  would  be  difficult  to  equal  such  groupings 
as  “Ankles:  see  Accidents”  or  “Chief  topic  on  the  Stock  Exchange:  see  Failure." 
In  other  cases,  however,  the  effect  is  merely  rococo,  as  in  “Marriage:  see  Hotel 
Accommodations”  or  “Noses:  see  also  Fittings,  Machinery,  and  Spare  Parts." 

Valuable  as  it  is  from  both  the  literary  and  the  practical  standpoint,  it  is 
plain  that  the  code  book  was  intended  for  people  who  get  around  more  than  I do. 
Such  well-meant  suggestions  as  deobi  (A  great  battle  is  now  raging  here),  pumzi 
(Can  you  combine  horses  and  grain?),  and  ezucz  ( Calling  at  Elephant  Point  for 
orders)  can  hold  for  me  at  best  only  an  academic  interest.  But  any  of  these  mes-

sages  is  a monument  of  utility  beside  the  picturesque  ybtua,  which  deals  with 
the  transportation  to  Mecca  of  pilgrims — at  the  prevailing  price  per  head\  And 
however  much  I may  regret  my  inability  to  send  a message  like  wumnd  (Have 
every  reason  to  believe  oil  will  be  struck),  at  least  I feel  certain  that  I shall  never 
rise,  Phoenix-like,  from  my  own  ashes  to  cable  that  most  fantastic  of  all  code 
words,  ahxno  : Met  with  a fatal  accident.

CIPHERS  IN  THE  PAST  TENSE 


all  cryptanalysts  have  not  borne  arms  for  Mars.  Some  of  the  most 
prolific  have  served  Clio,  the  muse  of  history.  Many  of  these  unsung  heroes — 
the  only  cryptologists  whose  contributions  enlightened  all  mankind — worked 
in  the  19th  century.  The  immense  influence  of  Leopold  von  Ranke’s  objective 
school  of  history,  which  demanded  a study  of  the  original  documents,  sent 
droves  of  historians  to  mine  state  papers  and  diplomatic  correspondence  in 
the  archives,  whose  doors  had  been  unlocked  for  the  first  time  by  the  national- 
ism and  democracy  of  the  1800s. 

The  researchers  found  many  of  the  documents  in  cipher,  or  partly  so. 
Invariably,  it  seemed,  the  crux  of  a dispatch  was  enciphered.  In  the  mid-1500s, 
a Venetian  ambassador  wrote  home  about  his  talk  with  Henry  II  of  France 
concerning  English  affairs.  “His  Majesty  suddenly  turned  to  me,  taking  a 
troubled  aspect  and  shrugging  his  shoulders,  added  to  me  these  very  words 
. . . .”  and  the  rest  is  in  cipher!  Historians  realized  that  the  most  important 
parts  were  the  most  likely  to  be  put  into  cipher.  Some,  unfamiliar  with  crypt- 
analysis, apparently  regarded  the  resultant  cryptogram  as  an  act  of  God,  an 
insuperable  obstacle  which  they  would  have  to  live  with  as  with  a hole  in  the 
document.  “Were  we  able  to  decipher  the  letters  written  on  congressional 
politics  by  Richard  Henry  Lee  and  his  correspondents  ...  no  doubt  much  of 
the  cloud  which  hangs  over  the  congressional  intrigues  of  that  critical  period 
would  be  removed,”  mourned  Francis  Wharton  in  1889  in  The  Revolutionary 
Diplomatic  Correspondence  of  the  United  States. 

But  other  scholars  looked  upon  the  cryptograms  as  a challenge.  One  of  the 
first  of  these  was  a transplanted  German  whose  services  to  English  historio- 
graphy were  of  high  importance. 

Gustave  Adolph  Bergenroth  was  born  February  26,  1813,  at  Marggra- 
bowa,  which  his  biographer  called  “an  insignificant  town  in  the  remotest  and 
dreariest  corner  of  East  Prussia.”  He  attended  the  University  of  Konigsberg, 
where  he  was  very  popular  with  his  fellow  students  and  where  he  sustained  a 
severe  injury  to  his  right  wrist  in  duelling.  After  working  in  Cologne  and 
Berlin  as  an  assessor,  with  time  out  for  a trip  to  Italy  necessitated  by  his  liberal 
views,  he  quit  his  job  and  sailed  in  1850  for  California  as  a pioneer.  The  racy 
style  of  his  first  composition  in  English,  “The  First  Vigilance  Committee,” 

854 


855 


Ciphers  in  the  Past  Tense 

drew  favorable  attention,  and  he  determined  to  write.  After  some  literary 
work,  he  began  a history  of  Tudor  England.  Finding  the  available  materials 
insufficient,  he  set  out,  late  in  his  forties,  for  that  great  repository  of  docu- 
ments for  those  years  when  Spain  bestrode  the  world,  the  Archivio  General  at 
Simancas  in  northwest  Spain.  His  letters  home  soon  won  him  a stipend  from 
England’s  Master  of  the  Rolls  to  find,  list,  and  summarize  the  state  papers  at 
Simancas  that  related  to  English  history  and  to  prepare  a volume  for  the 
Spanish  series  of  the  endless  Calendars  of  State  Papers.  He  forgot  his  Tudor 
history. 

He  arrived  at  Simancas  in  September,  1860,  and  established  himself  in  a 
kind  of  hotel,  the  Parador  della  Luna,  where  he  would  do  much  of  his  crypt- 
analysis. An  Englishman  who  visited  him  painted  the  scene:  “Simancas  is  a 
collection  of  wretched  hovels,  half  buried  in  dust  and  sand.  There  is  not  a good 
house  in  the  place.  The  one  in  which  Mr.  Bergenroth  lives  belongs  to  a farm 
bailiff,  consists  of  two  storeys,  all  the  rooms  of  plaster,  and  the  floors  of  brick. 
No  fireplace  in  any  of  the  rooms,  and,  as  the  winter  is  very  intense  here  from 
November  to  February,  and  the  walls  full  of  holes,  nothing  but  the  strongest 
desire  to  do  service  to  history  could  reconcile  any  man  to  so  much  hardship.” 
Bergenroth  had,  moreover,  to  overcome  some  of  the  oddest  phenomena  ever 
to  interfere  with  cryptanalysis.  The  plaza  beneath  his  room  was  crowded 
with  shouting  donkey-drivers  and  visited  frequently  by  a dulciana,  whose 
“shrill  notes,  continually  playing  an  air  from  Traviata  and  one  Spanish 
melody,  and  nothing  else,  drive  me  almost  mad.  His  landlady  liked  to  strum 
on  her  guitar,  and  “none  but  drivers  of  bullock-carts  could,  for  a single  night, 
stand  the  music  of  the  Lady  della  Luna.”  The  kitchen  girl  “hangs  my  linen 
and  that  of  the  whole  family  over  my  balcony  for  drying,  and  then,  with 
laudable  resolution,  sets  to  ironing  it  on  my  writing-table.” 

More  troubles  faced  him  at  the  Archivio  General.  It  consists  of  an  old 
castle,  with  crenellated  walls  pierced  by  loopholes,  surrounded  by  deep 
moats  and  drawbridges.  Its  46  rooms  contain  more  than  100,000  bundles,  or 
legajos,  in  each  of  which  are  filed  from  10  to  100  documents,  making  a total  of 
several  million.  From  this  staggering  accumulation  Bergenroth  had  to  select 
the  pertinent  items.  It  was  hard  for  him  even  to  get  at  them.  When  Spain  s 
archives  administration  finally  granted  him  entree,  the  crabbed  Renaissance 
semiuncials  made  long  and  dogged  practice  necessary  before  he  could  read  the 
handwriting.  Indeed,  the  archivist  himself  had  often  been  defeated  by  it,  and 
in  his  jealousy  at  Bergenroth’s  success  he  deliberately  hampered  the  historian  s 
work  by  refusing  access  to  such  cipher  keys  as  were  in  his  possession.  Bergen- 
roth had  to  recover  them  by  himself,  as  well  as  those  keys  that  had  been  lost. 

The  story  of  his  cryptanalytic  endeavors  can  be  pieced  together  from 
several  of  his  writings. 

I did  not  go  to  Spain  quite  unprepared  for  my  work.  I had  carefully  studied 

the  Paleographie  of  Christoval  Rodriguez;  I had  also  spent  much  time  in 


856  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

deciphering  such  old  Spanish  documents  as  were  to  be  found  in  the  libraries 
of  London  and  Paris.  . . . 

[At  Simancas.]  The  first  thing  I considered  it  necessary  to  do  was  to  study 
most  carefully,  not  only  the  Spanish  orthography  of  the  period,  but  that  of  each 
statesman  in  particular  who  could  be  supposed  to  have  written  any  of  these 
letters.  Even  this  was  not  sufficient.  I had  to  study  the  turns  of  thought,  and  the 
favourite  words  and  expressions  of  each  statesman.  Long  and  curious  lists,  cover- 
ing many  sheets  of  paper,  lay  during  many  months  on  my  writing-table,  and  were 
stuck  up  against  the  wall  of  my  room. 

I did  not  discover  any  of  the  keys  to  the  ciphers  in  a methodical  manner. 
Whilst  engaged  in  copying  I was  constantly  on  the  watch  for  a weak  point,  con- 
vinced that  no  man  can  for  any  length  of  time  succeed  so  completely  disguising 
his  thoughts  but  that  he  will  occasionally  betray  himself  to  a close  observer. 
Wherever  I thought  that  that  was  the  case,  I tried  to  guess  the  meaning  of  the 
signs.  A hundred  times  I may  have  done  so  in  vain,  but  at  last  I triumphed.  . . . 

When  copying  an  instruction  to  the  Duke  [de  Estrada],  I discovered  little 
dots,  like  full  stops,  behind  two  signs  of  cipher.  As  interpunction  is  never  used  in 
cipher  of  this  kind,  the  dots  could  only  be  signs  of  abbreviation.  But  even  ab- 
breviations (a  skilful  writer  would  never  have  made  use  of  them)  offer  so  many 
difficulties  that  they  can  be  employed  only  on  the  most  common  occasions,  as, 
for  instance,  V.  A.  for  Vuestra  Alteza,  or  n.f.  for  nuestra  fija,  or  nuestro  fijo. 
From  obvious  reasons  [in  this  case],  I decided  in  favor  of  “nuestra  fija,”  and 
inferred  further  that  the  preceding  signs  must  correspond  to  “princesa  de 
Gales.”  The  breach  was  opened,  and  before  three  o'clock  in  the  next  morning  I 
was  in  possession  of  eighty-three  signs,  representing  the  letters  of  the  alphabet, 
and  of  thirty-three  monosyllables,  signifying  words.  The  key  is  far  from  being 
complete,  but  there  remain  no  longer  unconquerable  difficulties. . . . [This  cipher] 
of  the  Duke  de  Estrada  is  the  most  difficult,  and  at  the  same  time  the  most  im- 
portant of  all,  as  a greater  number  of  undeciphered  despatches  are  written  in  it 
than  in  any  other  kind  of  cipher.  . . . 

The  question  may  be  asked,  whether  my  decipherings  are  trustworthy?  I 
answer  with  full  confidence  in  the  affirmative.  I have  more  reason  than  one  for 
doing  so.  After  I had  deciphered  the  despatches,  I found,  in  some  instances,  that 
they  were  only  ciphered  copies  of  drafts  in  plain  writing.  Thus  1 had  an  oppor- 
tunity of  comparing  my  interpretations  with  the  originals,  and  found  that  in  all 
essential  points  they  were  identical.  The  key  of  De  Puebla  and  the  fragments  of 
the  two  other  keys,  which  were  given  to  me  after  my  return  from  Madrid,  pro- 
vided me  with  an  additional  test.  The  keys  which  I had  already  formed  before 
seeing  them  coincided  perfectly  with  them.  . . . But  the  general  and  most  decisive 
proof  consists  in  the  meaning  of  the  despatches,  concealed  behind  the  cipher. 

In  ten  months,  Bergenroth  surpassed  the  feats  of  many  professional  crypt- 
analysts by  reconstructing  19  nomenclators — an  average  of  about  one  every 
two  weeks,  some  with  2,000  or  3,000  elements.  This  was  in  addition  to  his 
own  copying,  his  supervising  of  a copyist,  his  searching  for  documents,  his 
battles  with  the  bureaucracy,  and  his  frequent  letters  home.  He  did  not  like 
the  cryptanalysis:  “Nothing  but  sheer  necessity  would  have  forced  me  to 
attempt  such  a task,  which,  I think,  is  one  of  the  most  laborious  that  any  man 


857 


Ciphers  in  the  Past  Tense 

could  undertake.”  Yet  by  July  23,  1861,  ten  months  after  his  arrival,  he  could 
report,  “The  despatches  in  cipher  are  all  copied  and  deciphered,  with  the 
exception  of  two  small  letters  (the  one  of  them  from  John  Stile  to  Henry  VII.), 
which  I intend  to  decipher  in  Barcelona  or  in  London.  I am  now  too  fatigued 
for  a work  which  requires  so  much  concentration  of  thought  as  the  discovery 
of  keys  to  unknown  cipher  does.”  He  did  solve  the  Stile  letter,  but  not  the 
other,  a short  one  from  King  Ferdinand  and  Queen  Isabella  dated  at  Segovia 
on  August  20,  1503,  the  only  one  in  that  key.  This  key  was  the  only  one  of 
those  used  by  Spain  during  the  reign  of  England’s  Henry  VII  (1485-1509) 
that  he  failed  to  read.

Gustave  Bergenroth' s reconstruction  of  a Spanish  cipher 


One  long  dispatch,  whose  solution  took  a week,  typifies  the  treasures  he 
unearthed.  It  is  a letter  of  July  25,  1498,  from  Don  Pedro  de  Ayala  in  London 
to  Ferdinand  and  Isabella,  reporting  on  England's  fitting  out  of  an  expedition 
to  some  islands  in  the  New  World  which,  Ayala  thinks,  had  already  been  dis- 
covered by  Columbus  and  were  owned  by  Spain.  He  apparently  referred  to 
the  second  voyage  of  John  Cabot,  on  whose  discoveries  the  English  claims  to 
North  America  rested.  Though  some  of  the  nomenclators  that  Bergenroth 
recovered  were  later  found  in  the  archives,  many  others  never  were,  and  only 
his  cryptanalyses  brought  the  documents  to  light.  Bergenroth  died  in  1869  of  a 
fever  contracted  at  Simancas,  but  the  results  of  his  labors  shine  today  in  the 
close-printed  pages  of  his  Calendars  of  Letters,  Despatches,  and  State  Papers 
Relating  to  the  Negotiations  Between  England  and  Spain.  To  their  resumes  of 
hundreds  of  documents,  the  historians  return  time  and  again,  with  gratitude. 

Bergenroth  had  been  assisted  in  his  cryptologic  work  at  Simancas  by 
Paul  Friedmann,  who  appears  to  have  been  some  kind  of  itinerant  archivist. 
For  France’s  Bibliotheque  Nationale  he  compiled  a collection  of  ciphers  em- 
ployed by  various  French  political  correspondents  of  the  16th  century.  In 


858 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


1868  he  became  interested  in  the  cipher  messages  of  Giovanni  Michiel, 
Venetian  ambassador  to  the  court  of  England’s  Queen  Mary,  sister  and  pre- 
decessor of  Elizabeth  I.  No  one  in  the  archives  of  Venice  could  read  the  dis- 
patches, and,  though  photographs  of  them  were  sent  to  England  for  attempts 
at  solution  there,  they  continued  to  baffle  everyone.  In  Venice,  Friedmann 
examined  the  Michiel  correspondence  and  “soon  arrived  at  the  conviction 
that  the  cipher  was  not  one  of  extraordinary  difficulty,  that  it  was  not  always 
used  with  sufficient  care,  and  that  with  a little  labor  the  sense  might  be  dis- 
covered.” It  used  about  200  signs,  and  within  a few  months  he  had  solved  it. 
Thus  d1 1 was  bo,  d12  was  g,  t25  Sua  Maesta,  and  so  forth. 

“Michiel’s  correspondence  is  of  a considerable  value,”  Friedmann  wrote. 
“It  will  redress  many  errors,  and  fill  many  a gap  in  the  narratives  . . . .”  For 
example,  historians  had  generally  considered  that  the  transfer  of  the  future 
Queen  Elizabeth  from  Woodstock  to  Hampton  Court  took  place  in  June, 
1554,  and  was  a release  from  prison  after  all  hope  of  Mary’s  having  a child 
had  faded  and  she  no  longer  needed  to  keep  the  presumptive  Protestant 
heiress  under  her  control.  Michiel’s  letters  make  clear  that  what  happened 
was  just  the  reverse.  The  removal  took  place  not  in  June  but  in  April,  at  the 
very  moment  when  Mary  was  expected  to  give  birth,  and  it  was  not  a release 
but  a tightening  of  security  in  the  face  of  the  grumblings  of  the  populace 
against  the  thought  of  a Catholic  offspring  of  Spain’s  Philip  and  Mary  upon 
the  English  throne.  No  child  was  born,  of  course,  and  Elizabeth  later  ascended 
the  throne,  to  the  delight  of  her  people.  Thus  did  cryptanalysis  help  rectify 
knowledge  of  a tense  episode  in  the  life  story  of  one  of  England’s  greatest 
sovereigns. 

Friedmann  bitterly  complained  that  an  Italian  archivist,  Luigi  Pasini, 
attempted  to  claim  credit  for  the  Michiel  solution  when,  in  fact,  he  merely 
augmented  it.  This  was  true,  but  Pasini  did  achieve  some  notable  cryptanalyses. 
He  had  begun  work  in  the  Archivio  di  Stato  of  Venice  in  1855,  when  he  was 
20.  Ten  years  later,  he  became  interested  in  the  Venetian  ciphers  and  began 
collecting  keys  and  documents  concerning  them. 

His  enlargement  of  the  Michiel  nomenclator  won  him  the  commendation 
of  the  Master  of  the  Rolls,  and  when  a French  scholar,  Armand  Baschet, 
heard  of  it,  he  encouraged  Pasini  to  attack  the  enciphered  dispatches  of  the 
Venetian  ambassadors  to  the  court  of  France  for  the  last  four  years  of  the 
reign  of  Henry  II,  the  three-year  reign  of  Francis  II,  and  the  first  five  years  of 
Charles  IX,  for  all  of  which  no  decipherments  or  keys  could  be  found.  Pasini, 
an  intelligent  and  likable  young  man,  succeeded  in  solving  about  5,000  lines, 
and  Baschet,  who  had  at  first  considered  not  publishing  the  dispatches  for 
those  years  because  the  most  valuable  information  was  concealed  under  the 
cipher,  could  declare:  “Thanks  to  his  [Pasini’s]  extraordinary  aptitude,  the 
dispatches  of  six  Venetian  ambassadors  for  a period  of  twelve  years,  written 
in  the  impress  of  great  events  such  as  the  last  struggles  of  the  King  of  France 
with  the  [Holy  Roman]  Emperor  and  the  Spaniards,  and  the  first  religious

Ciphers  in  the  Past  Tense 

wars,  have  recovered  their  extreme  interest.”  Pasini  also  assisted  Baschet 
cryptologically  in  a study  of  the  letters  of  Aldus  Manutius,  the  great  printer. 
He  continued  to  collect  material  on  the  history  of  Venetian  ciphers  until  his 
death  in  1885. 

Another  Italian  archivist,  Domenico  Pietro  Gabbrielli,  an  abbot,  was 
positively  awesome  in  his  cryptanalytic  industry.  He  was  appointed  an  ap- 
prentice archivist  in  the  diplomatic  section  of  the  Archivio  di  Stato  of  Flor- 
ence early  in  1854,  when  he  was  30.  Ten  years  later  he  began  a nine-year 
marathon  of  historical  cryptanalysis,  becoming  probably  the  most  expert 
solver  of  nomenclators  who  ever  lived.  He  solved  400  in  his  first  seven  years, 
a rate  of  better  than  one  nomenclator  solution  per  week.  He  owed  this  ap- 
parently incredible  facility  to  his  progression  from  the  simple  ciphers  of  the 
1400s  to  the  full  nomenclators  of  the  1700s,  which  familiarized  him  with  the 
quirks  and  trends  and  phraseology  of  Florentine  cryptography,  to  the  prob- 
able similarity  of  many  of  the  nomenclators,  to  the  great  volume  of  material 
at  hand,  and  to  his  own  ability.  In  addition  to  his  solutions,  he  reconstructed 
twice  as  many  nomenclators  from  existing  plain  and  cipher  versions  of  dis- 
patches. 

Gabbrielli  solved  or  reconstructed  1,755  nomenclators,  dating  from  1414 
to  1742.  They  fill  16  volumes  arranged  either  administratively  (as  Volume 
III,  130  keys  to  the  correspondence  of  Cosimo  I de  Medici,  ruler  of  Florence 
from  1536  to  1574)  or  geographically  (as  Volume  XVI,  142  keys  to  the  cor- 
respondence from  France  from  1542  to  1735).  Death  halted  his  work  on 
November  26,  1873,  while  he  was  in  the  midst  of  compiling  a 17th  volume  on 
ciphers  for  Spain.  An  unfinished,  unbound  file  containing  attempts,  excerpts, 
and  various  keys  testifies  mutely  to  his  persistence. 

In  the  United  States,  Edmund  C.  Burnett  solved  many  of  the  letters  that 
Wharton  did  not  in  editing  the  great  collection  of  Letters  of  Members  of  the 
Continental  Congress.  In  Germany,  more  recently,  Bernard  Bischoff  has 
reconstructed  the  ciphers  used  in  scores  of  medieval  manuscripts,  often  from 
just  a sentence  or  two.  Guillermo  Lohmann  Villena,  a Peruvian  diplomat, 
solved  a number  of  ciphers  during  his  exhaustive  researches  into  the  systems 
used  by  Spain  during  her  colonization  of  the  New  World. 

These  mass-production  artists  are  followed  by  many  one-shot  historical 
cryptanalysts  who  have  encountered  a cipher  or  two  during  their  researches 
and  have  cracked  it.  In  the  late  1930s,  Howard  Peckham  of  the  William  L. 
Clements  Library  at  the  University  of  Michigan  solved  parts  of  the  Andre 
dictionary-code  correspondence  that  was  involved  in  the  Benedict  Arnold 
treason.  "The  reason  1 was  able  to  decode  [letter]  No.  31  was  because  No.  30 
exists  here  in  both  coded  and  decoded  form,  and  also  Washington’s  proclama- 
tion, which  [Carl]  Van  Doren  mentioned  [in  his  Secret  History  of  the  American 
Revolution ] but  did  not  print,  is  there  in  code  and  could  be  decoded  by  refer- 
ence to  a plain  copy.  These  two  items  gave  me  quite  a vocabulary  to  work  with, 
without  the  dictionary.”  Derek  J.  Price,  professor  of  the  history  of  science  at

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Yale,  tackled  a monalphabetic  substitution  in  an  astronomical  manuscript 
by  Geoffrey  Chaucer  and  solved  it,  bringing  to  light  a cipher  message  by  one 
of  the  greatest  names  in  English  literature. 

The  enormous  volume  of  Spanish  letters  in  the  early  years  of  modern 
history  makes  their  solution  a subspecies  in  themselves.  The  Belgian  J.  P. 
Devos,  who  published  a large  collection  of  Spanish  nomenclators  in  1950, 
found  it  necessary  to  solve  an  enciphered  dispatch  to  reconstitute  one  of  them. 
About  the  same  time,  Miguel  Gomez  del  Campillo  solved  messages  of  Tomas 
Perrenot,  senor  de  Chantonnay,  sent  to  Philip  II  and  the  Duke  of  Alba.  In 
1926,  a young  Mexican  historian,  Don  Francisco  Monterde  Garcfa-Icazbalta, 
won  a prize  of  200  gold  pesos  established  by  a merchant  for  the  first  solution  of 
an  enciphered  letter  by  Cortez,  which  is  the  oldest  extant  example  of  New 
World  cryptography.  Shortly  before  his  death  in  1934,  the  German  Robert 
Fuchs  solved  a 15-page  letter  of  Charles  V that  gave  instructions  in  1546  to  a 
cardinal  on  his  way  to  Rome.  And  early  in  the  1900s,  Henry  Biaudet,  who 
forgot  his  copy  of  the  key  of  Don  Juan  de  Zuniga  y Requesens  when  he  went 
to  Geneva  to  study  that  Renaissance  diplomat’s  correspondence,  “was  able 
to  reconstruct  it  on  the  spot  without  the  least  difficulty.” 

More  recently,  Raoul  Brunon  solved  several  16th-century  nomenclators 
for  the  sumptuous  volume,  with  many  facsimiles  of  the  actual  cipher  letters, 
that  he  and  his  brother  Jean  published  in  1952,  Les  Franfais  en  Italie  sous 
Henri  II.  In  1947,  Dr.  Rebeca  Rosell  Planas  reconstructed  the  keys  used  by 
Jose  Marti  of  Cuba  in  his  correspondence  before  the  Cuban  revolution 
against  Spain  and  read  some  of  the  never-before-solved  portions  of  his  letters. 
A century  before,  Dietrich  C.  von  Rommel  published  the  key  to  the  nomen- 
clatorthat  Henry  IV  of  France  had  used  with  Maurice  the  Wise.  The  Babbage 
and  Wheatstone  solutions  of  royal  letters  of  the  1600s  fall  into  this  category. 
And  there  must  be  dozens  more  who  have  similarly  succeeded  in  a bit  of 
cryptanalysis  like  this. 

The  thought  of  tearing  away  the  veil  that  has  enshrouded  a message  for 
perhaps  hundreds  of  years  exerts  a potent  lure  upon  all  minds.  Not  even  the 
professional  cryptologist,  who  daily  solves  cryptograms  of  immediate  im- 
portance, remains  immune.  Etienne  Bazeries  succumbed  often.  He  solved 
nomenclators  of  Francis  I,  Francis  II,  Henry  IV,  Mirabeau,  Napoleon.  But 
his  greatest  historical  effort  led  to  what  he  thought  was  the  solution  of  one  of 
the  most  tantalizing  of  mysteries — the  identity  of  the  Man  in  the  Iron  Mask. 

In  1891,  Commandant  Gendron  of  the  French  General  Staff  found  himself 
stymied  in  his  study  of  the  campaigns  of  Marshal  Nicolas  de  Catinat,  one  of 
Fouis  XIV’s  generals,  by  five  ciphered  dispatches  to  Catinat  from  Fouis  him- 
self and  by  two  from  Fouvois,  the  minister  of  war.  Gendron  appealed  for 
help  to  Bazeries,  who,  after  examining  them,  boldly  declared  that  he  would 
solve  them — to  the  astonishment  of  Gendron,  who  had  submitted  the  mes- 
sages in  vain  to  other  cryptologists.  Bazeries  felt  so  confident  because  he  had 


861 


Ciphers  in  the  Past  Tense 

observed  that  the  cipher  numbers  ran  from  1 to  the  high  500’s  and  that 
repetitions  were  rife.  This  convinced  him  that  the  cipher  numbers  mostly 
represented  plaintext  syllables — a method  rare  since  the  telegraph  had  killed 
the  nomenclator,  and  probably  the  reason  for  the  failure  of  the  other  crypto- 
logists. 

Bazeries  first  made  a frequency  count  of  the  12,125  groups  of  the  dis- 
patches, finding  that  the  most  frequent  group  was  22,  appearing  187  times. 
Then  followed  124,  with  185  occurrences,  42  with  184,  311  with  145,  125  with 
127,  and  so  forth.  With  no  tables  of  syllable  frequencies  available,  Bazeries  had 
to  guess.  He  supposed  the  order  to  be  le,  la,  les,  de,  des,  du,  au,  il,  et,  vous,que, 
and  so  on.  Then,  surmising  that  the  phrase  les  ennemis  would  crop  up  fre- 
quently in  military  dispatches,  he  split  it  into  syllables  and  matched  it  with  five 
figures  that  appeared  together  several  times  with  only  slight  variations.  These 
variations,  he  conjectured,  represented  homophones.  To  discover  them  is  the 
first  step  in  the  solution  of  nomenclators.  Thus,  he  assumed  that

all  stood  for 

He  inserted  these  values  throughout  the  cryptograms,  giving  him  the  meaning 
of  approximately  one  group  in  every  eleven.  At  one  point,  he  read, 

52  124  22  88  374  46  284 
les  en  mi 

Obviously,  this  was  a case  in  which  the  second  syllable  of  les  ennemis  had  been 
broken  up  into  letters;  the  284  was  still  another  equivalent  for  the  plural 
ending,  and  52  stood  for  que  (“that”).  Proceeding  like  this,  Bazeries  gradually 
pulverized  the  two-part  nomenclator,  possibly  composed  by  Bonaventure 
Rossignol  himself.  He  found  it  to  consist  of  587  equivalents  for  letters,  syl- 
lables, words,  and  nulls,  which  also  served  as  punctuation  marks.  One  sign 
had  the  interesting  function  of  erasing  the  previous  sign. 

After  solving  the  dispatch  of  July  8,  1691,  Bazeries  read  how  displeased 
the  king  was  that  one  of  Catinat’s  commanders,  Vivien  Fabbe,  Seigneur  du 
Bulonde,  had  disobeyed  Catinat’s  orders  and  raised  the  siege  of  the  northern 
Italian  town  of  Coni.  The  action  defeated  the  French  Army,  ended  its  campaign 
in  Piedmont,  and  rudely  jolted  the  pride  of  the  haughty  Sun  King.  The  dis- 
patch ordered  Catinat  to  arrest  Bulonde  and  “conduct  him  to  the  fortress  of 
Pignerol,  where  His  Majesty  desires  that  he  be  guarded  locked  in  a cell  of  that 
fortress  at  night  and  having  the  liberty  during  the  day  of  walking  on  the  battle- 
ments with  a 330  309.”  These  two  figures  appeared  nowhere  else  in  the  dis- 
patches, and  Bazeries,  who  knew  that  the  mysterious  masked  prisoner  of  the 


862 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Bastille  had  come  there  from  Pignerol  and  was  treated  as  a person  of  consider- 
able importance,  concluded  that  330  represented  the  infrequent  word  masque 
and  309  a period  or  stop  and  published  to  the  world  his  finding  that  Bulonde 
had  been  the  Man  in  the  Iron  Mask. 

The  determination  has  been  attacked  on  psychologic,  linguistic,  and  cryp- 
tologic grounds.  Bulonde,  runs  one  counterargument,  was  a relatively  minor 
soldier  who  did  not  warrant  the  deference  that  later  gave  rise  to  the  specula- 
tion that  the  masked  prisoner  was  an  illegitimate  son  of  Louis.  Moreover,  the 
text  as  cryptanalyzed  would  have  meant  “with  a masked  person”  to  Louvois, 
who  would  have  said  “en  masque”  instead  of  “avec  un  masque.”  The  word 
masque  does  not  belong  in  a military  repertory,  and,  indeed,  an  exhaustive 
examination  of  the  much  larger  nomenclators  of  succeeding  rulers  of  France 
shows  not  one  that  includes  it. 

But  what  most  impedes  a wider  acceptance  of  the  theory  is  that  in  1708, 
five  years  after  the  death  of  the  mysterious  masked  prisoner  of  Pignerol  and 
the  Bastille,  Bulonde  was  still  alive. 

Solutions  more  valid  than  Bazeries’  wild  leap  at  masque  can,  on  the  other 
hand,  revolutionize  some  long-accepted  views  of  events  in  history.  One  such 
provides  unexpected  support  to  the  lingering  but  unsubstantiated  theory  that 
the  murder  of  Abraham  Lincoln  was  engineered  by  his  own  Secretary  of 
War,  the  ambitious  and  highhanded  Edwin  Stanton,  as  part  of  a plot  to 
seize  control  of  the  government  and  impose  a hard  and  bitter  peace  upon  the 
South. 

In  a bound  volume  of  Colburn's  United  Service  Magazine  for  the  second 
half  of  1864  that  he  had  bought  for  50  cents,  New  Jersey  chemist  and  Civil 
War  buff  Ray  A.  Neff  noticed  one  day  in  1962  what  appeared  to  be  cipher 
messages  written  in  pencil  in  the  inner  margins  of  a few  pages.  The  one  on 
page  1 83,  for  example,  began  :jo5ofx2spnf6uifsf8xbmlfe.... 
Neff  enlisted  the  aid  of  Leonard  Fousche,  a self-styled  professional  crypto- 
grapher of  Collingswood,  New  Jersey.  It  could  not  have  taken  Fousche 
long  to  find  that  the  cipher  was  the  simplest  possible,  each  plaintext  letter 
being  replaced  by  the  one  following  it  in  the  normal  alphabet,  with  the 
numbers  indicating  word  separations.  The  cryptogram  on  page  183  solved 
out  as  a long  allegorical  poem,  beginning:  In  new  Rome  there  walked  three 
men,  a Judas,  a Brutus,  and  a spy.  Each  planned  that  he  should  be  the  kink 
[king]  when  Abraham  should  die.  . . . Neff  also  found  a series  of  much  longer 
messages  spelled  out  by  placing  dots  under  letters  on  the  volume’s  printed 
pages,  reading  from  right  to  left  and  from  bottom  to  top.  Page  106  began  the 
narrative:  It  urn  on  the  tenth  of  April,  Sisty-five  when  I first  knew  that  the  plan 
was  in  action  (evidently  no  x appeared  on  that  page,  so  the  cipherer  used  an 
s instead  in  sisty).  Page  107  continued:  Ecert  had  made  all  the  contacts,  the 
deed  to  be  done  of  the  forteenth  [the  date  of  Lincoln’s  assassination].  I did  not 
know  the  identity  of  the  assassin  but  I knew  most  all  else  when  I approached  E. 
S.  about  it.  Page  120  reported  that  there  were  at  least  eleven  members  of 


Ciphers  in  the  Past  Tense  863 

Congress  involved  in  the  plot.  After  a long  gap,  there  appeared  on  page  245  an 
ominous  I fear  for  my  life.  LCB. 

Who  was  L.C.B.?  Neff  developed  on  an  outer  margin  an  invisible-ink 
signature  of  Lafayette  C.  Baker,  chief  of  the  secret  National  Detective  Police. 
Neff  feels  that  the  “E.S.”  in  the  dot  message  and  the  “Judas”  in  the  substitu- 
tion refer  to  Stanton.  The  Judas  metaphor  rests  upon  Stanton’s  hypocrisies 
vis-a-vis  Lincoln,  such  as  in  secretly  opposing  many  of  the  President’s  policies 
in  Congress.  Brutus  connects  with  John  Wilkes  Booth,  the  actual  assassin  and 
a noted  Shakespearean  actor.  As  for  the  spy  who  walked  in  new  Rome,  the 
cryptogram  concludes : But  lest  one  is  left  to  wonder  what  has  happened  to  the 
spy,  I can  safely  tel! you  this,  it  was  I.  Lafayette  C.  Baker.  2-5-68.  Neff  further 
believes  that  “Ecert”  was  really  Thomas  T.  Eckert,  general  superintendent  of 
military  telegraphs,  whose  name  Baker  intentionally  misspelled  because  no  k 
appears  on  page  107  until  near  the  top  and  Baker  did  not  want  to  leave  so 
long  a gap  in  his  dot  message.  Lincoln  had  wanted  the  tall  and  strong  Eckert 
as  his  bodyguard  at  Ford’s  Theatre;  the  major  declined,  saying  he  had  work 
to  do ; but  in  fact  he  did  not  work  that  night  and  was  home  when  notified  of 
the  shooting. 

It  is  possible  that  Baker,  a notorious  charlatan,  scoundrel,  and  liar,  could 
have  left  the  message  simply  to  embarrass  Stanton  and  Eckert.  But  Neff  ad- 
duces circumstantial  evidence  tending  to  show  that  the  secret  service  chief  was 
poisoned  by  arsenic  in  a vain  attempt  to  silence  him.  Furthermore,  Baker 
pricked  out  a notice  that  The  names  of  these  known  conspirators  is  presented 
without  comment  or  notation  in  Vol.  one  of  this  series.  Perhaps  this  cryptogram 
will  force  a reappraisal  of  one  of  the  crudest  moments  in  the  whole  of 
American  history — if  only  somebody  could  find  the  first  half  of  the  1864 
Colburn’s  United  Service  Magazine. 

The  longest,  the  best  known,  the  most  tantalizing,  the  most  heavily 
attacked,  the  most  resistant,  and  the  most  expensive  of  historical  cryptograms 
remains  unsolved.  It  fills  an  anonymous,  untitled  volume  that  has  been  called 
“the  most  mysterious  manuscript  in  the  world.”  In  1962,  rare  book  dealer 
Hans  P.  Kraus  of  New  York  attracted  worldwide  attention  when  he  asked 
$160,000  for  this  book  that  no  one  can  read. 

The  volume  itself  is  unprepossessing.  A large  octavo  of  about  6x9  inches, 
it  has  204  pages;  28  others  are  lost.  Its  covers,  of  vellum  like  the  leaves,  are 
off.  Dozens  of  tiny  female  nudes,  astrological  diagrams,  and  about  400 
drawings  of  fanciful  plants  illuminate  the  book  in  blue,  dark  red,  light  yellow, 
brown,  and  an  especially  vivid  green.  Running  among  these  decorations  is 
the  text  itself.  The  manuscript  somewhat  resembles  an  herbal — a book,  com- 
mon in  the  Middle  Ages,  listing  plants  with  medicinal  properties  and  often 
giving  recipes  for  extracting  drugs  from  them. 

At  first  glance,  the  text  that  is  the  heart  of  the  mystery  appears  to  be  no 
problem  at  all.  It  does  not  look  cryptic.  It  looks  like  ordinary  late-medieval

handwriting.  The  symbols  preserve  the  general  form  of  letters  of  that  time, 
which  they  are  not;  they  are  like  old  friends  whose  names  are  on  the  tip  of 
one’s  tongue.  The  writing  flows  smoothly,  as  if  a scribe  were  copying  an 
intelligible  text;  the  symbols  do  not  seem  to  have  been  printed  one  by  one. 
In  the  most  cursory  examination  of  a single  page,  the  eye  recognizes  the  same 
letters  again  and  again,  and  then  it  sees  repeated  groups  and  even  repeated 
words,  sometimes  with  slightly  different  endings. 

All  this  sounds  as  if  the  text,  if  not  in  a known  language  disguised  to  the 
modern  eye  by  the  unfamiliar  handwriting,  should  be  in  some  easily  ascer- 
tainable tongue.  Yet  scholars  in  the  most  recondite  languages  have  stated  that 
they  could  not  understand  it.  Palaeographers  have  declared  that  the  script 
was  not  known  to  them.  And  cryptanalysts,  whose  frequency  counts  of  the 
approximately  29  symbols  (some  blend  into  others  and  are  hard  to  define) 
looked  like  those  of  an  ordinary  monalphabetic  substitution,  and  who  laughed 
to  themselves  when  they  spotted  all  those  repetitions  that  this  would  be  simpler 
than  the  puzzle  cryptograms  in  newspapers,  turned  away  in  chagrin  when  their 
attempt  to  resolve  the  text  into  church  Latin,  or  Middle  English,  or  langue 
d’oc,  or  some  other  appropriate  tongue,  failed  utterly. 

This  is  not  to  say  that  no  one  has  ever  claimed  to  have  solved  it.  Indeed, 
one  solution  that  was  announced  temporarily  transformed  the  manuscript 
into  perhaps  the  most  important  document  in  the  history  of  science.  Un- 
fortunately, it,  as  well  as  the  others,  has  been  disproved. 

Mystery  has  beclouded  the  manuscript  since  its  recorded  history  began. 
That  was  on  August  19,  1666,  when  Joannes  Marcus  Marci,  the  highly 
respected  rector  of  the  University  of  Prague,  sent  the  book  to  his  former 
teacher,  Athanasius  Kircher,  the  most  famous  Jesuit  scholar  of  his  time. 
Kircher  had,  three  years  earlier,  published  a book  on  cryptology  and  a uni- 
versal language,  and  had  boasted  of  having  solved  the  riddle  of  hieroglyphics. 
In  a letter  accompanying  the  book,  Marci  recalled  that  the  former  owner  of  the 
book  had  sent  Kircher  a portion  of  the  text  for  possible  solution.  To  that  work 
the  owner  “devoted  unflagging  toil  . . . and  he  relinquished  hope  only  with 
his  life.  But  his  toil  was  in  vain,  for  such  Sphinxes  as  these  obey  no  one  but 
their  master,  Kircher.  Accept  now  this  token,  such  as  it  is  and  long  overdue 
though  it  be,  of  my  affection  for  you,  and  burst  through  its  bars,  if  any  there 
be,  with  your  wonted  success.”  Bars  there  were,  but  Kircher,  who  never 
shrank  from  bragging  of  what  he  thought  were  his  successes,  did  not  burst 
through  them,  for  his  silence  on  this  point  is  eloquent. 

Marci  wrote  that  the  manuscript  had  been  bought  for  600  ducats  by  the 
Holy  Roman  Emperor  Rudolf  II.  More  of  a scholar  than  a ruler,  Rudolf 
founded  observatories  for  Tycho  Brahe  and  Johannes  Kepler,  established  a 
botanical  garden,  and  set  up  an  alchemical  laboratory  to  which  he  invited 
numberless  scientists.  The  presence  of  the  manuscript  at  his  court  in  Prague 
was  later  proved  by  the  discovery  in  a margin  of  the  autograph  of  Johannes 
de  Tepenecz,  a Bohemian  scientist  who  was  a favorite  of  Rudolf.

Marci  also  reported  the  belief  that  the  author  of  the  manuscript  was 
Roger  Bacon,  the  English  Franciscan  friar  who  lived  from  about  1214  to  1294. 
Bacon  had  speculated,  centuries  before  they  became  reality,  on  the  possibility 
of  microscopes  and  telescopes,  motorboats,  horseless  carriages,  and  flying 
machines.  Popular  legend  credited  him  with  great  magical  abilities,  a reputa- 
tion probably  enhanced  by  his  extensive  writing  on  alchemy.  He  interests

modern  science  because  of  his  precocious  emphasis  on  observation  of 
natural  phenomena,  so  unlike  the  a priori  scholasticism  of  his  time.  He  is 
not  to  be  confused  with  Sir  Francis  Bacon,  the  English  statesman  who  lived 
from  1561  to  1626,  wrote  the  famous  Essays,  and  largely  shaped  modern 
science  through  the  influence  of  his  philosophy — although  that  philosophy, 
insisting  upon  induction  and  experimentation,  does  bear  a strange  kinship  to 
that  of  his  medieval  namesake.  Presumably  Roger  Bacon  would  have  written 
the  manuscript  in  cipher  to  conceal  secrets  that,  if  publicized,  would  have 
left  him  open  to  the  grave  medieval  charge  of  black  magic. 

But  how  did  a manuscript  attributed  to  Roger  Bacon  get  to  Rudolf’s 
court  at  Prague?  Between  1584  and  1588,  one  of  the  Emperor’s  most  welcome 
visitors  was  Dr.  John  Dee,  an  English  divine,  mathematician,  and  astrologer 
who  is  sometimes  said  to  have  been  the  model  for  Prospero  in  The  Tempest. 
Dee  shared  Rudolf’s  interest  in  the  occult  and  was  an  enthusiast  for  Roger 
Bacon,  manuscripts  of  many  of  whose  works  he  had  collected.  He  knew  the 
young  Francis  Bacon  and  may  have  even  introduced  him  to  the  works  of 
Roger  Bacon,  which  may  help  explain  the  similarities  in  their  thought.  Dee 
may  have  been  aware  of  Roger  Bacon’s  own  brief  discussion  of  cryptography 
in  the  Epistle  on  the  Secret  Works  of  Art  and  the  Nullity  of  Magic.  He  cer- 
tainly had  some  knowledge  of,  and  considerable  interest  in,  cryptology,  for  in 
1562,  he  bought  for  Sir  William  Cecil,  Queen  Elizabeth’s  great  minister,  a 
manuscript  of  Trithemius’  “Steganographia,”  which  had  not  yet  been  pub- 
lished and  “for  wch  a Thowsand  Crownes  have  ben  by  others  offred,  and  yet 
could  not  be  obteyned.”  Dee  spent  ten  days  “with  contynuall  Labor  and 
watch”  in  making  himself  a copy. 

It  may  be  that  Dee  had  somehow  obtained  the  mysterious  manuscript 
(possibly  from  the  Duke  of  Northumberland,  who  pillaged  many  religious 
houses  when  Henry  VIII  broke  up  the  monasteries,  and  with  whose  family  Dee 
was  associated),  was  told  or  assumed  that  it  was  Bacon’s,  tried  to  solve  it,  and, 
failing,  made  a gift  of  it  to  Rudolf,  perhaps  on  behalf  of  Elizabeth,  for  whom 
he  was  serving  at  Rudolf’s  court  as  a secret  political  agent.  The  English  physi- 
cian and  writer  Sir  Thomas  Browne  (who,  incidentally,  first  used  the  word 
“cryptography”  in  English)  related  that  Dee's  son,  “Dr.  Arthur  Dee  (speak- 
ing about  his  father’s  life  in  Prague)  told  about . . . book  containing  nothing 
but  hieroglyphicks,  which  book  his  father  bestowed  much  time  upon,  but  I 
could  not  hear  that  he  could  make  it  out.”  The  comment  may  refer  to  this 
very  manuscript. 

This  is  conjectural,  however.  What  is  certain  is  that  Kircher  deposited  the 
manuscript  in  the  Jesuit  Collegium  Romanum,  and  that  in  1912  an  American 
rare  book  dealer  named  Wilfred  Voynich  purchased  it  for  an  undisclosed  sum 
from  the  Jesuit  school  of  Mondragone  in  Frascati,  Italy. 

Eager  to  read  the  manuscript,  Voynich  generously  supplied  photostats  to 
anyone  who  seemed  likely  to  solve  it.  Many  tried.  Botanists  thought  they 
could  read  it  by  identifying  the  plants  and  assuming  their  names  as  probable

Ciphers  in  the  Past  Tense 

words;  one  difficulty  here  was  that  most  of  the  flora  were  imaginary.  Astron- 
omers recognized  stars  such  as  Aldebaran  and  the  Hyades  but  could  not  force 
a solution.  Philologists  tried  the  methods  used  for  reading  lost  languages  and 
failed.  Cryptanalysts  observed  characteristics  in  common  with  ordinary  ciphers 
and  found  that  it  resisted  their  well-tried  techniques.  Voynich  heard  from 
many  specialists  who  were  interested  in  the  problem:  palaeographer  H. 
Omont  of  Paris’  Bibliotheque  Nationale,  who  had  written  a learned  article 
about  a 15th-century  cryptographic  manuscript  on  alchemy;  Professor  A.  G. 
Little,  a foremost  authority  on  Bacon;  a Harvard  professor  of  anatomy; 
George  Fabyan  of  the  Riverbank  Laboratories;  the  vice  president  of  the 
Royal  Astronomical  Society  in  London;  even  Dom  Aidan,  Cardinal  Gasquet, 
prefect  of  the  Vatican  Archives,  who  offered  to  help  get  any  documents  from 
those  archives  that  might  throw  light  on  the  problem.  Almost  certainly  many 
of  these  and  others  tried  to  solve  the  cryptogram.  Among  the  others  in  1917 
was  Captain  John  M.  Manly,  then  second  in  command  of  Yardley’s  MI-8. 
He  had  cracked  the  Lother  Witke  cipher  that  had  baffled  all  his  colleagues 
but,  like  the  others,  with  the  Voynich  manuscript  he  failed.  And  so  did 
Yardley. 

In  1919,  some  of  Voynich’s  reproductions  found  their  way  to  William 
Romaine  Newbold,  a professor  of  philosophy  and  former  dean  of  the 
Graduate  School  at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania.  Newbold,  54,  a brilliant 
man  who  had  stood  first  in  his  class  of  1887  at  Pennsylvania,  had  wide- 
ranging  interests,  many  of  which  had  in  common  an  element  of  the  occult — 
spiritism,  the  Gnostics,  the  Great  Chalice  of  Antioch,  supposed  by  some  to 
be  the  actual  chalice  of  the  Last  Supper,  which  is  known  in  legend  as  the 
Holy  Grail.  He  knew  many  languages  and  later  became  proficient  in  crypt- 
analysis: in  1922,  Theodore  Roosevelt,  Jr.,  then  Assistant  Secretary  of  the 
Navy,  thanked  him  for  his  “time  and  trouble  in  deciphering  espionage  cor- 
respondence that  had  baffled  the  Departments  here  in  Washington.” 

Newbold  saw  microscopic  shorthand  symbols  in  the  macroscopic  charac- 
ters of  the  manuscript  text  and  began  his  decipherment  by  transliterating 
them  into  Roman  letters.  A secondary  text  of  17  different  letters  resulted.  He 
doubled  all  but  the  first  and  last  letters  of  each  section:  the  secondary  text 
oritur  would  become  the  tertiary  text  or-ri-it-tu-ur.  Any  of  these  groups  that 
contained  any  of  the  letters  of  the  word  conmuta,  plus  q,  underwent  a special 
substitution.  The  resultant  quaternary  text  was  then  “translated”:  Newbold 
replaced  the  pairs  of  letters  with  a single  letter,  presumably  according  to  a 
key,  which,  however,  he  never  made  clear.  Newbold  regarded  some  letters 
of  this  reduced  quinary  text  as  equivalent  to  one  another  because  of  phonetic 
similarity.  When  required,  therefore,  he  interchanged  d and  t,  for  example,  b, 
f and  p,  o and  u,  and  so  on.  Finally,  Newbold  anagrammed  the  letters  of  this 
senary  text  to  produce  the  alleged  plaintext  in  Latin. 

In  April,  1921 , Newbold  announced  the  preliminary  results  of  his  solution 
according  to  this  method  before  brilliant  and  learned  audiences.  These  results 


868 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


stamped  Roger  Bacon  as  the  greatest  scientific  discoverer  of  all  time.  Accord- 
ing to  Newbold,  Bacon  had  recognized  the  Great  Nebula  in  Andromeda  as  a 
spiral  galaxy,  identified  biological  cells  and  their  nuclei,  and  come  close  to 
seeing  the  union  of  the  sperm  with  the  ovum.  He  had  therefore  to  have  not 
merely  speculated  about  but  to  have  actually  constructed  a microscope  and  a 
telescope  and  used  them  to  make  discoveries  that  anticipated  the  20th  cen- 
tury. Newbold’s  cryptanalysis  of  a caption  on  a sketch  that  somewhat  re- 
sembles a pinwheel  and  that  he  took  to  represent  the  Andromeda  nebula 
reads  in  part:  “In  a concave  mirror  I saw  a star  in  the  form  of  a snail  . . . 
between  the  navel  of  Pegasus,  the  girdle  of  Andromeda,  and  the  head  of 
Cassiopeia.”  Newbold  asserted  that  his  solution  could  not  be  subjective  be- 
cause “1  did  not  know  at  the  time  [of  solution]  that  any  nebula  would  be 
found  within  the  region  thus  defined.” 

Newbold’s  solution  created  a sensation  in  the  world  of  scholarship.  Many 
scientists,  though  declining  to  pass  upon  the  validity  of  the  cryptanalysis, 
which  they  did  not  think  themselves  competent  to  do,  accepted  the  results 
with  alacrity.  One  eminent  physiologist  went  so  far  as  to  specify  that  some 
of  the  drawings  probably  represented  the  columnar  epithelial  cells  with  their 
cilia,  drawn  to  a magnification  of  75.  The  public  at  large  was  fascinated. 
Sunday  supplements  had  a field  day.  One  poor  woman  came  hundreds  of 
miles  to  beseech  Newbold  to  use  Bacon’s  formulas  to  cast  out  the  demons 
that  possessed  her.  The  cipher  itself  drew  mixed  reviews.  Manly,  back  at  the 
University  of  Chicago,  half  accepted,  half  rejected  it.  “Professor  Newbold’s 
theory  and  system  now  seem  much  more  reasonable  than  they  did  a year  ago 
when  he  first  explained  them  to  me,”  he  wrote  in  Harper's  Magazine.  But  a 
writer  in  Scientific  American  Monthly,  J.  Malcolm  Bird,  observed  acutely,  in 
relation  to  the  tertiary  text  of  interlocking  pairs,  as  or-ri-it-tu-ur,  that  “Pro- 
fessor Newbold  has  not  in  any  of  his  public  utterances  explained  satisfac- 
torily how,  in  the  original  encipherment,  it  is  possible  to  . . . get  letter-pairs 
that  interlock  as  in  the  above  example.”  In  other  words,  although  the  system 
might  work  in  deciphering  it  did  not  seem  to  work  in  enciphering.  Many  one- 
way ciphers  have  been  devised:  it  is  possible  to  put  messages  into  cipher,  but 
not  to  get  them  back  out.  Newbold's  seemed  to  be  the  only  example  extant  of 
the  reverse  situation.  For  this  and  other  reasons,  Bird  rejected  the  solution. 

The  excitement  simmered  down.  Newbold  went  back  to  continue  his 
solutions;  other  scholars  weighed  his  conclusions.  In  1926,  Newbold  died. 
But  his  working  notes,  his  solutions,  and  the  chapters  for  the  book  that  he 
had  projected  were  faithfully  edited  by  his  friend  and  colleague  Roland 
Grubb  Kent.  In  1928,  they  were  published  as  The  Cipher  of  Roger  Bacon.  An 
important  French  philosopher,  Etienne  Gilson,  later  one  of  the  40  “immortals” 
of  the  Academie  Frangaise,  though  bewildered  by  the  method,  accepted  the 
results;  a French  specialist  in  Bacon,  Raoul  Carton,  enthusiastically  en- 
dorsed both  method  and  results.  American  and  British  historians  of  medieval 
science  were  cooler. 


869 


Ciphers  in  the  Past  Tense 

In  1931,  Manly,  who  had  studied  the  Newbold  method  in  detail,  con- 
cluded that  it  “is  open  to  objections  of  so  grave  a character  as  to  make  it  im- 
possible to  accept  the  results.”  Warning  that  these  results  “threaten  to  falsify, 
to  no  unimportant  degree,  the  history  of  human  thought,”  he  demolished 
them  in  a 47-page  article.  He  pointed  out  that  the  cipher  postulated  by  New- 
bold  permitted  many  different  “solutions.”  The  encipherer  could  never  be 
certain  that  his  message  would  get  through  correctly;  the  decipherer  would 
never  know  whether  he  was  reading  the  intended  message.  The  chief  cause  of 
this  flexibility  lay  in  the  anagramming  process — the  one  that  finally  produced 
the  Latin  plaintext.  Anagramming  rearranges  letters  of  one  text  into  another; 
it  is  a kind  of  unkeyed  transposition.  Often  many  anagrams  are  possible: 
live,  veil,  evil,  vile,  and  Levi  are  all  anagrams  of  the  “ciphertext”  eilv,  each  as 
valid  as  the  next.  As  the  number  of  letters  involved  rises,  the  possible  ana- 
grams increase  in  geometric  proportion.  The  31  letters  of  the  angelic  saluta- 
tion, “Ave  Maria,  gratia  plena,  Dominus  tecum,”  have  afforded  thousands  of 
different  anagrams,  all  perfect  in  spelling,  diction,  and  syntax.  One  zealot 
turned  out  1,500  pentameters  and  1,500  hexameters;  another  3,100  anagrams 
in  prose  and  an  acrostic  poem;  another  composed  a “Life  of  the  Virgin” 
in  27  anagrams— all  these  of  the  salutation.  Newbold  tended  to  anagram 
Bacon’s  message  in  blocks  of  55  or  1 10  letters.  How  certain  could  he  then  be 
that  his  anagram  was  the  right  one?  The  answer  is  that  he  could  not  be 
certain  at  all. 

Manly  also  showed  that  the  alleged  shorthand  signs  were  nothing  more 
than  the  breaking  up  of  the  thick  ink  on  the  rough  surface  of  the  vellum  into 
shreds  and  filaments  that  Newbold  had  imagined  were  individual  signs.  New- 
bold  himself  conceded  that  “I  frequently,  for  example,  find  it  impossible  to 
read  the  same  text  twice  in  exactly  the  same  way.”  Manly  pointed  to  different 
solutions  from  the  same  text.  Linally,  he  criticized  the  texts  of  the  solutions 
themselves  on  the  ground  that  they  “contain  assumptions  and  statements 
which  could  not  have  emanated  from  Bacon  or  any  other  thirteenth  century 
scholar.” 

How,  then,  to  explain  Newbold’s  cryptanalyzing  information  that  he  said 
he  never  knew,  such  as  the  position  of  the  spiral  nebula?  The  answer  is  that 
he  must  have  known  it,  though  subconsciously.  Newbold,  a scholar  of  im- 
mense erudition  who  casually  learned  the  Catalan  language  and  read  a 
thousand  pages  in  it  in  pursuit  of  a minor  point  of  the  solution,  must  have 
swept  up  that  detail  in  his  extensive  studies  and  slipped  it  into  the  depths  of 
his  brain,  where  it  lay  hidden  from  his  active  mind  until  the  solution  drew  it 
forth.  No  one  ever  questioned  Newbold's  integrity;  he  was  a victim.  Manly 
said,  “of  his  own  intense  enthusiasm  and  his  learned  and  ingenious  sub- 
conscious.” 

The  spectacular  collapse  of  the  Newbold  theory  has  not  deterred  other 
scholars  from  attacking  the  manuscript,  though  it  has  made  them  a bit  more 
cautious  in  publishing  their  “solutions.”  In  1943,  however,  a Rochester,

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


New  York,  lawyer,  James  Martin  Feely,  recklessly  exposed  to  the  world — 
and  to  its  ridicule — a solution  that  makes  little  sense  in  Latin  and  not  much 
more  in  English:  “The  feminated,  having  been  feminated,  press  on  the  fore- 
bound; those  pressing  on  are  moistened;  they  are  vein-laden;  they  will  be 
broken  up;  they  are  lessened.” 

Two  years  later,  Dr.  Leonell  C.  Strong,  a highly  respected  cancer  research 
specialist,  concluded  that  the  Voynich  manuscript  was  the  work  of  one  An- 
thony Ascham,  an  English  scholar  of  the  1500s  and  author  of  an  herbal. 
Strong  cryptanalyzed  out  of  the  manuscript  several  texts  in  alleged  medieval 
English,  including  a contraceptive  formula,  by  means  of  a “double  reverse 
system  of  arithmetic  progressions  of  a multiple  alphabet,”  by  which  he 
apparently  meant  some  form  of  polyalphabeticity.  The  contraceptive  works, 
and  anyone  who  wishes  to  prove  it  may  do  so,  since  Strong  published  it;  but 
he  has  not  seen  fit  to  do  the  same  with  his  method  of  cryptanalysis,  and  it 
therefore  remains  unproved  and  unaccepted.  His  published  texts  have  been 
severely  attacked  on  linguistic  grounds,  and  the  formula  has  been  explained 
on  the  same  basis  of  subconscious  knowledge  as  Newbold’s  spiral-nebula 
solution. 

There  have  been  many  more  attempts  that  did  not  result  in  publication 
because  the  would-be  solvers  honestly  admitted  defeat.  Scores  of  persons 
have  worked  at  home  on  the  illustrations  in  the  Newbold  volume  without  suc- 
cess. In  1944,  from  among  specialists  in  languages,  documents,  mathematics, 
botany,  and  astronomy  then  doing  war  work  in  Washington,  William  F. 
Friedman  organized  a group  to  work  on  the  problem.  Unfortunately,  by  the 
time  they  had,  working  after  hours,  completed  the  task  of  transcribing  the 
text  into  symbols  that  tabulating  machines  could  process,  the  war  was  over 
and  the  group  disbanded. 

Their  preliminary  results  had  the  effect  of  deepening  the  mystery.  For 
they  found  that  words  and  groups  of  words  repeat  more  often  in  the  manu- 
script than  in  ordinary  language.  This  fact  alone  differentiates  the  manuscript 
from  all  other  cryptograms,  for  all  known  cipher  systems  seek  to  suppress 
repetitions,  not  to  intensify  them. 

What  causes  this  difference?  Friedman  thinks  that  the  manuscript 
represents  a text  in  an  artificial  language  that  has  divided  all  existence  into 
categories,  assigned  each  a basic  symbol,  and  indicated  subclasses  by  addi- 
tional symbols  tacked  onto  the  first.  The  first  artificial  language,  that  of  the 
Scot  George  Dalgarno,  was  of  this  kind.  He  distributed  knowledge  into  17 
main  classes  and  labeled  each  with  a consonant:  for  example,  K stood  for 
political  matters,  N for  natural  objects.  He  subdivided  these  into  subclasses 
and  assigned  a vowel  to  each.  Thus  Ke  was  “judicial  affairs,”  Ku  “war.” 
Finer  divisions  were  represented  by  alternating  consonants  and  vowels.  Many 
other  artificial  languages  of  this  type  have  been  invented,  one  by  Bishop  John 
Wilkins,  who  wrote  the  first  book  on  cryptology  in  English.  Obviously  a text 
in  such  a language  would  repeat  its  “roots”  over  and  over  while  its  suffixes 


871 


Ciphers  in  the  Past  Tense 

would  vary — and  this  phenomenon  is  very  common  in  the  Voynich  manu- 
script. Friedman  planned  to  test  this  hypothesis  (in  which  the  English 
cryptologist  Brigadier  John  H.  Tiltman  concurs)  on  an  R.C.A.  301  com- 
puter, but  the  work  did  not  progress  very  far. 

Another  explanation  for  the  great  redundancy  is  that  it  reflects  the  many 
repetitions  of  pharmaceutical  formulas  that  are  likely  to  occur  in  an  herbal  or 
any  medical  tract.  This  is  the  view  of  the  late  Father  Theodore  C.  Petersen, 
Ph.D.,  of  St.  Paul’s  College  in  Washington,  D.C.,  an  expert  in  ancient  docu- 
ments who  made  a 40-year  study  of  the  Voynich  manuscript.  He  thought  that 
minute  variations  in  the  shape  of  the  characters  and  in  their  hooks  and  other 
appendages  might  represent  the  syllables  of  a medieval  shorthand.  He  never 
did  collect  the  statistical  evidence  he  needed  to  confirm  or  refute  this  hypo- 
thesis. 

Yet  men  have  solved  mysteries  far  more  abstruse.  Why  hasn't  anyone  un- 
riddled this?  The  reason,  Manly  said,  is  that  “the  attack  has  proceeded  on 
false  assumptions.  We  do  not,  in  fact,  know  when  the  manuscript  was  written, 
or  where,  or  what  language  lies  at  the  basis  of  the  encipherment.  When  the 
correct  hypotheses  are  applied,  the  cipher  will  perhaps  reveal  itself  as  simple 
and  easy.  . . .” 

Is  it,  then,  just  a gigantic  hoax,  like  the  Cardiff  giant  or  the  Piltdown  man 
or  the  fossils  of  Professor  Beringer?  Nobody  involved  with  it  seems  to  think 
so — and  this  includes  those  who  have  been  rebuffed  by  it.  The  work  is  too 
well  organized,  too  extensive,  too  homogeneous.  Nothing  repeats  larger  than 
a group  of  five  words,  whereas  in  actual  hoaxes,  such  as  the  fake  hieroglyphic 
papyri  sometimes  sold  to  tourists  in  Egypt,  much  longer  phrases  are  repeated. 
Moreover,  the  words  in  the  text  recur,  but  in  different  combinations,  just  as 
in  ordinary  writing.  Even  if  it  were  a hoax,  there  seems  to  be  no  point  to 
having  made  it  so  long.  Most  critically,  the  medieval  quasi-science  that  was 
seeking  the  philosopher’s  stone  and  the  elixir  of  life  while  the  manuscript  was 
being  written  was  too  credulous  to  entertain  the  concept  of  a hoax. 

Voynich  died  in  1930.  His  wife,  Ethel,  kept  the  manuscript  in  a safe- 
deposit  box  at  the  Guaranty  Trust  Company  in  New  York  for  30  years,  until 
her  death  in  1960,  aged  96.*  Her  estate  sold  it  to  Kraus.  He  priced  it  at 
$160,000  because  he  believes  that  the  manuscript  contains  information  that 
could  provide  new  insights  into  the  record  of  man.  “The  moment  someone 
can  read  it,”  he  says,  “this  book  is  worth  a million  dollars.”  Others  do  not 
think  so.  They  contest  the  attribution  to  Bacon,  observing  that  the  manuscript 

* Mrs.  Voynich  deserves  a footnote.  Her  novel,  The  Gadfly,  has  sold  more  than  2,500,000 
copies  in  translation  in  the  Soviet  Union,  where  critics  revere  her  as  one  of  the  all-time 
greats  in  English  fiction.  The  patriotic  romance,  a best-seller  when  it  was  published  in 
England  in  1897,  is  read  by  most  Russian  schoolchildren,  forms  the  subject  of  Soviet 
doctoral  theses,  and  has  been  made  into  a movie  and  an  opera.  The  Russians  think  so  highly 
of  it  that  they  paid  Mrs.  Voynich  one  of  the  very  few  royalty  fees  they  ever  gave  to  an 
American.

looks  much  more  like  a 16th-  than  a 13th-century  work.  They  feel,  as  did  an 
American  foundation  that  turned  down  Friedman’s  application  for  funds  to 
attack  it,  that  it  contains  nothing  new,  that  it  may  be,  after  all,  only  some 
kind  of  fanciful  herbal. 

But  no  one  yet  knows,  and  the  book  lies  quietly  inside  its  slipcase  in  the 
blackness  of  Kraus’  vault,  possibly  a time  bomb  in  the  history  of  science, 
awaiting  the  man  who  can  interpret  what  is  still  the  most  mysterious  manu- 
script in  the  world.

THE  PATHOLOGY  OF  CRYPTOLOGY 


sickness  APPEARS  in  cryptology  as  cryptanalytic  hyperactivity.  Its 
victims  overcryptanalyze  documents,  and  they  bring  forth  invalid  solutions. 
A case  in  point  is  William  R.  Newbold’s  “solution  of  the  Voynich  manu- 
script. It  is  not  necessary,  however,  that  the  cryptic  text  be  patent,  that  it  be, 
in  other  words,  a cryptogram.  The  text  subjected  to  the  excessive  cryptan- 
alysis may  be  a steganogram,  which  conceals  the  presence  of  the  real,  the 
secret  message  beneath  an  innocent  cover-text.  Steganography  opens  a much 
wider  field  of  search  for  those  seeking  documents  on  which  to  vent  their 
excessive  cryptologic  energies,  for  they  may  postulate  that  any  text  contains 
a hidden  communication  beneath  a dissembling  surface.  The  literary  excel- 
lence of  the  outer  text  will  then  only  attest  to  the  superiority  of  the  stegano- 
graphy; the  less  suspicious  the  outer  text  by  virtue  of  its  literary  qualities,  the 
better  the  steganogram.  And,  indeed,  those  who  suffer  from  the  most  virulent 
form  of  this  mania  attack  what  on  this  basis  would  be  the  greatest  stegano- 
gram of  all  time— the  plays  of  William  Shakespeare,  seeking  to  draw  forth 
solutions  demonstrating  that  the  real  author  was  Francis  Bacon. 

They  are  not  entirely  without  cryptologic  warrant.  Just  as  systems  of 
cryptography  have  transmitted  valid  messages  despite  abuses  like  Newbold’s, 
so  systems  of  steganography  have  preserved  legitimate  messages  beneath  an 
innocent  camouflage.  Among  these  are  steganograms  of  authorship.  In  1897, 
the  eminent  philologist  Walter  W.  Skeat  was  editing  The  Testament  of  Love, 
which  had  been  attributed  to  Chaucer  in  its  only  known  copy,  a printing  of 
1532,  when  he  noticed  that  the  initial  letters  of  the  various  chapters  were 
intended  to  form  an  acrostic.  With  some  emendation,  they  spelled  out 
Margarete  of  Vitrw,  have  merci  on  thin[e] — Usk — indicating  as  some  other 
scholars  had  suggested,  that  the  real  author  was  not  Chaucer  but  Thomas 
Usk.  Other  cases  are  known,  probably  the  earliest  of  which  is  in  cuneiform 
the  only  case  in  which  a cuneiform  author  gives  his  name.  The  most  famous 
authorship  steganogram  involves  the  famous  Hypnerotomachia  Poliphili, 
published  by  Aldus  Manutius  at  Venice  in  1499  with  no  author  listed.  It  is 
regarded  as  one  of  the  most  beautiful  books  ever  printed,  and  its  typeface 
has  inspired  many  of  the  ones  used  today.  The  title  is  made  up  of  five  Greek 
roots  and  has  been  translated  as  “The  Strife  of  Love  in  a Dream.”  As  early 

873 


874 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


as  1512,  however,  readers  discovered  that  the  first  letters  of  the  38  chapters 
spelled  out  Poliam  frater  Franciscus  Columna  peramavit  (“Brother  Francesco 
Colonna  passionately  loves  Polia”).  Colonna  was  a Dominican  monk,  still 
alive  when  the  book  was  published,  and  the  reason  for  the  secrecy  was  clear. 
Polia  is  still  unknown. 

It  was  thus  perfectly  possible  for  Francis  Bacon  to  have  used  stegano- 
graphy  to  simultaneously  conceal  and  reveal  his  authorship  of  the  Shake- 
speare works.  The  question  is,  Did  he  ? 

The  first  to  assert  that  he  did  was  one  of  America’s  most  colorful  political 
figures,  a round-faced  man  of  great  wit,  ability  as  a public  speaker,  and  per- 
sonal popularity.  Ignatius  Donnelly  became  lieutenant  governor  of  Minnesota 
at  28,  and,  four  years  later,  in  1863,  began  the  first  of  three  terms  in  the  House 
of  Representatives.  A political  quarrel  there  blocked  a fourth  nomination.  He 
quit  the  Republican  party  and,  his  radical  reforming  proclivities  coming  to 
the  fore,  became  a Granger  and  a Greenbacker  and  won  repeated  election  to 
the  State  Senate.  But  in  1878,  following  his  rejection  by  the  voters  in  a contest 
for  Congress,  he  espoused  two  theories  of  pseudo  science — the  existence  of 
Atlantis  and  the  devastating  prehistoric  collision  of  the  earth  with  a comet. 
At  the  same  time,  having  chanced  across  a description  of  a steganographic 
system  by  Francis  Bacon  in  a book  belonging  to  one  of  his  children,  Every 
Boy's  Book , and  apparently  having  heard  of  the  new  theory  that  attributed 
Shakespeare's  plays  to  Bacon,  he  determined  that  in  the  winter  of  1878-79  “I 
will  reread  the  Shakespeare  plays,  not,  as  heretofore,  for  the  delight  which 
they  would  give  me,  but  with  my  eyes  directed  to  discover  whether  there  is  or 
is  not  in  them  any  indication  of  a cipher.  . . . The  things  to  be  on  the  lookout 
for  in  my  reading  were  the  words  Francis,  Bacon,  Nicholas  [father  of  Francis], 
and  such  combinations  of  Shake  and  Speare  or  Shakes  and  peer  as  would 
make  the  word  Shakespeare.” 

This  search  served  as  a recreation  during  Donnelly’s  more  serious  work 
of  supporting  his  family  by  his  pen.  In  1882  there  appeared  Atlantis:  The 
Antedeluvian  World.  With  enormous  and  wide-ranging  but  undisciplined 
erudition,  Donnelly  gave  Plato’s  legend  of  the  lost  continent  coherent  form 
for  the  first  time.  He  regarded  it  as  the  actual  Garden  of  Eden.  As  evidence 
for  its  existence,  he  marshalled  similarities  in  flood  myths,  pyramid-building, 
knowledge  of  embalming,  and  a 365-day  calendar  between  the  civilizations  of 
ancient  Egypt  and  of  the  Aztecs  and  Mayans  in  the  New  World.  The  book 
was  an  immense  success.  Within  eight  years,  it  had  gone  through  23  editions 
in  the  United  States  and  27  in  England  (and  in  the  1960s  a paperback  pub- 
lisher issued  it  anew).  It  brought  Donnelly  his  first  secure  and  comfortable 
income,  and  made  him  probably  the  most  discussed  literary  figure  outside  of 
professional  and  intellectual  circles.  The  following  year  he  offered  Ragnarok: 
The  Age  of  Fire  and  Gravel.  This  volume,  a predecessor  of  Immanuel  Velikov- 
sky’s  controversial  Worlds  in  Collision  of  1950,  argued  that  earth  had  col- 
lided with  a mighty  comet  in  its  infancy.  The  stories  of  Sodom  and  Gomorrah 


875 


The  Pathology  of  Cryptology 

and  Joshua’s  commanding  the  sun  to  stand  to  still,  together  with  race- 
memories  of  similar  events  in  other  cultures,  testified  to  this  catastrophe, 
Donnelly  said.  Ragnarok  (whose  title  was  taken  from  an  Old  Norse  term  for 
“doom  of  the  gods”)  also  sold  well. 

Even  while  writing  it,  however,  Donnelly  was  quoting  in  his  diary  for 
September  23,  1882:  “I  have  been  working  ...  at  what  I think  is  a great  dis- 
covery I have  made,  to  wit : a cypher  in  Shakespeare’s  Plays  . . . asserting 
Francis  Bacon’s  authorship  of  the  plays  ...  I am  certain  there  is  a cypher 
there,  and  I think  I have  the  key;  all  this  cannot  be  accident.”  A year  later  the 
solution  of  this  cipher  had  become  his  consuming  passion : “I  think  about  it  all 
day  and  dream  about  it  all  night;  it  is  hideously  complicated  and  perplexing.” 
By  May,  1884,  its  calculations  had  wearied  him,  and  he  turned  with  relief  to 
the  composition  of  the  book  that  was  to  be  his  magnum  opus,  The  Great 
Cryptogram. 

In  September  of  that  year,  when  he  was  running  again  for  Congress,  an 
acquaintance  broke  the  news  that  Donnelly  had  found  a cipher  in  Shake- 
speare. It  stirred  up  some  interest,  but  it  did  not  win  the  election  for  him. 
Nevertheless,  he  continued  his  political  activities  side  by  side  with  his  crypto- 
logic. In  1887,  the  year  that  he  won  election  to  the  State  Legislature  on  the 
Farmers’  Alliance  ticket,  Joseph  Pulitzer’s  New  York  World  sent  a professor 
of  mathematics  to  Donnelly’s  home  in  Nininger  City,  Minnesota,  to  exam- 
ine the  cipher  system,  which  involved  a great  deal  of  arithmetic.  On  August 
28  the  newspaper  splashed  the  professor  s favorable  appraisal  on  its  front 
page.  During  the  winter,  Donnelly  worked  from  10  a.m.  to  1 1 p.m.  to  com- 
plete the  book,  called  it  “a  terrible  task,”  and  finished  the  last  page  with  “an 
infinite  sense  of  relief.” 

What  had  he  discovered?  He  found,  as  he  had  expected  he  would,  a 
narrative  revealing  that  Skaks't  spur  never  writ  a word  of  them  and  It  is  even 
thought  here  that  your  cousin  of  St.  Albans  [Bacon  was  Viscount  of  St.  Albans] 
writes  them.  “Them”  referred,  of  course,  to  the  plays.  Some  of  the  decipher- 
ment was  in  the  third  person;  why,  Donnelly  never  explained.  How  had  he 
discovered  all  this? 

He  had  begun  by  misapprehending  Bacon’s  cipher.  Based  upon  this,  he 
had  sought  an  interrelationship  of  numbers  that  would  locate  the  words  of  the 
hidden  message  in  the  open  message  of  the  plays  by  their  serial  position  on  the 
page  or  in  an  act.  In  its  simplest  form,  the  system  would,  for  example,  find 
that  the  17th,  18th,  19th,  and  20th  words  on  pages  17,  18,  19,  and  20  spelled 
out  “I,  Bacon,  wrote  this.”  After  beginning  with  a fruitless  search  in  a modern 
edition  of  the  plays — as  if  Bacon,  in  addition  to  his  other  talents,  foresaw  the 
exact  pagination  to  be  used  200  years  after  his  death — Donnelly  woke  up  and 
turned  to  a facsimile  of  the  famous  First  Folio  of  Shakespeare’s  plays,  pub- 
lished in  1623,  three  years  before  Bacon  died. 

At  last  he  began  to  get  results.  They  were  not  simple.  Nor  were  they  as 
straightforward  as  the  fictitious  example  above.  By  some  reasoning  that  he 


876 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


never  set  forth,  Donnelly  settled  upon  505,  506,  513,  516,  and  523  as  “root- 
numbers.”  From  these  he  subtracted  “modifiers,”  or  sometimes  “multipliers” ; 
from  the  differences  he  deducted  the  number  of  italic  words  on  a page,  some- 
times counting  stage  directions,  sometimes  not;  these  results  were  altered  by 
the  addition  or  subtraction  of  the  number  of  hyphenated  and  bracketed 
words — although  he  confesses  that  “we  sometimes  counted  in  the  bracketed 
and  additional  hyphenated  words  . . . and  sometimes  we  did  not.”  The  final 
figure  showed  the  position  of  the  plaintext  word  on  the  page — then  the  page 
itself  varied,  and  sometimes  the  first  column  was  selected,  sometimes  the 
second,  and  occasionally  counting  began  at  the  beginning  of  a scene  instead 
of  the  page,  and  occasionally  at  the  bottom  of  the  page.  Donnelly  neglected 
to  say  why  he  chose  one  alternative  over  another,  though  he  did  set  out  his 
computations  in  impressive  detail:

The  “6  & h ” means  that  he  is  counting  bracketed  and  hyphenated  words. 
Donnelly  does  not  explain  the  mid-course  changes  after  the  periods  in  the 
computations  for  “spur”  and  “never,”  nor  the  sudden  backwards  counting  of 
“(121).”  The  First  Folio  pages  the  Comedies,  Histories,  and  Tragedies 
separately,  and  Donnelly’s  figures  refer  to  the  pages  of  the  Histories  in  the 
Staunton  reproduction. 

Donnelly’s  book,  The  Great  Cryptogram,  consisted  of  “deciphered”  pas- 
sages accompanied  by  their  derivations  and  interspersed  with  polemics 
defending  the  method  and  setting  the  hidden  story  in  perspective.  The  pub- 
lisher, R.  S.  Peale  and  Company  of  Chicago,  brought  in  a special  printer  to 
set  up  crucial  portions  of  the  book  without  seeing  the  rest.  But  Peale  had  a 
premonition  of  what  was  in  store  when  he  encountered  an  unexpected  resis- 
tance to  the  anti-Shakespeare  idea  as  he  sought  prepublication  subscriptions 
in  England.  He  set  the  first  edition  at  12,000  copies.  But  despite  the  reputation 
of  the  author,  the  book  flopped.  Hostile  reviews  battered  it.  Readers  found 
the  demonstration  of  the  cipher  confusing,  and  the  book  as  a whole  lacked 
flow.  Worst,  the  cipher  itself  suffered  crippling  blows. 

At  one  point,  after  deciphering  the  names  Cecil  (as  seas-ill),  Marlowe  (as 
More-low),  and  Shakespeare  (as  Shak' st-spur),  Donnelly  had  asked:  “Are 
there  four  other  columns,  on  three  other  consecutive  pages,  in  the  world, 
where  six  such  significant  words  can  be  discovered?  And,  if  there  are,  is  it 
possible  to  combine  them  as  in  the  foregoing  instances,  not  only  by  the  same 
root-number,  but  by  the  same  modification  of  the  same  root-number?  If 


The  Pathology  of  Cryptology  877 

you  can  indeed  do  this  in  a text  where  no  cipher  has  been  placed,  then  the  age 
of  miracles  is  not  yet  past.” 

Another  Minnesotan,  Joseph  Gilpin  Pyle,  promptly  demonstrated  that  it 
was  not.  He  parodied  both  the  title  and  the  method  of  The  Great  Cryptogram 
in  his  own  The  Little  Cryptogram,  in  which  he  extracted  by  a similar  method 
the  following  message  from  Hamlet:  Don  nill  he  [Donnelly],  the  author,

Some  of  Ignatius  Donnelly  s calculations 


devastating  work  by  the  Reverend  A.  Nicholson,  who  in  a cruel  coincidence 
happened  to  be  the  incumbent  clergyman  at  Bacon’s  own  home  of  St.  Albans. 
In  a brilliant  refutation,  Nicholson  used  Donnelly’s  own  root  of  516  on  the 
very  pages  in  which  Donnelly  first  glimpsed  his  solution  to  produce  a de- 
cipherment” diametrically  opposed  to  Donnelly’s:  Master  Will  I am  Shak'st 
spurre  writ  the  play  and  was  engaged  at  the  Curtain.  One  computation  ran: 
516-  167  = 349  — 226  &h  = 327-163  = 164-50  = 114-1/;  = 113,  point- 
ing to  the  113th  word  on  page  76,  column  2,  which  was  “Will."  Nicholson 
clinched  his  demonstration  by  producing  the  same  text  four  times  from 
Donnelly’s  four  other  root-numbers.  It  became  evident  to  all  but  Donnelly 
that  Pyle  and  Nicholson  had  merely  done  consciously  what  Donnelly  had 
done  subconsciously:  selected  the  words  of  the  hidden  message,  then  found 
the  figures  and  arithmetic  that  supported  them.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Donnelly,  unbowed,  went  to  Europe  to  lecture  on  his  decipherment.  At 
the  University  Union  at  Oxford,  where  he  debated  a Shakespearean,  a poll  of 
the  audience  routed  him,  167  to  27.  Criticism  grew  increasingly  harsh,  and 
when  he  returned  after  five  months,  Peale  told  him  that  the  book  was  dead. 
Donnelly  refused  to  believe  it,  kept  the  controversy  alive  in  letters  to  editors, 
and  had  the  Pinkerton  Agency  check  on  Peale’s  records.  Eventually  the  pub- 
lisher sued  him  for  $4,000  in  advance  royalties  that  had  not  been  earned.  To 
settle,  Donnelly  traded  the  publisher  lots  in  St.  Paul  for  the  plates  for  the  book. 
“I  will ...  put  them  in  my  garden,  and  build  a little  house  to  cover  them,”  he 
wrote  pathetically  in  his  diary  on  December  22,  1892.  “The  little  building 
will  be  my  monument  of  colossal  failure.  Every  time  I look  at  it,  I shall 
think  of  wrecked  hopes  and  ruined  ambitions.” 

He  was  unusually  depressed  because  he  had  just  lost  an  election  for 
governor  on  the  Populist  ticket,  for  which  he  had,  that  summer,  written  a 
ringing  platform  that  became  the  creed  of  this  third  party  and  foreshadowed 
many  modern  reforms.  Nevertheless,  he  soon  rebounded  and  continued  his 
fight  for  the  underdog.  He  had,  interestingly,  depicted  Bacon  in  his  decipher- 
ment somewhat  as  he  visualized  himself— a courageous,  honest,  struggling 
politician  victimized  by  greedy,  corrupt  officeseekers.  Donnelly  never  lost  his 
own  faith  in  his  Baconian  revelations,  and  he  continued  to  labor  at  the 
cipher.  In  1899  he  privately  published  The  Cipher  in  the  Plays  and  on  the 
Tombstone.  It  passed  directly  into  limbo.  His  political  fortunes  followed  it  the 
next  year,  when  the  Populists,  who  had  nominated  him  for  Vice  President, 
smothered  in  the  McKinley  victory.  On  January  1,  1901,  the  first  day  of  the 
twentieth  century,  Donnelly  died. 

Of  Donnelly’s  “system”  it  may  be  remarked  that  nothing  like  it  has  ap- 
peared in  cryptology  before  or  since.  And  with  good  reason,  for  the  system  is 
no  system  at  all;  there  is  neither  rhyme  nor  reason  to  the  choice  of  numbers 
that  lead  to  the  result.  It  may  also  be  remarked  that,  in  an  open-code  system, 
the  hidden  message  controls  the  cover-text,  which  is  merely  a function  of  the 
hidden  plaintext.  Donnelly,  though  he  worked  only  on  a few  pages  of  the 
two  parts  of  Henry  IV,  therefore  presupposed  that  the  magnificent  language 
of  the  plays  all  resulted  merely  from  the  inner  workings  of  a cipher.  Did 
FalstafF,  marvelous  Falstaff,  exist  so  exuberantly  only  to  make  sure  that 
Bacon  would  have  the  right  words  for  an  open  code?  The  thought  is  hard  to 
bear. 

Donnelly’s  murder  of  logic,  like  the  slaying  of  Banquo,  started  a line  of 
phantoms  that  threatens  to  stretch  out  to  the  crack  of  doom.  Among  the 
Baconians,  these  apparitions  are  “ciphers”  that  are  not  really  ciphers.  Like- 
wise, the  technique  of  descrying  them  is  not  really  cryptanalysis,  and  the 
results  are  not  solutions  or  decipherments.  They  are  the  deliriums,  the  hal- 
lucinations of  a sick  cryptology.  The  suggestion  to  call  this  whole  area 
“enigmatology”  comes  from  a Baconian;  and  it  is  a good  one,  for  it  will 


879 


The  Pathology  of  Cryptology 

prevent  using  the  terms  of  cryptology  for  noncryptology,  will  prevent  calling 
a “cipher”  that  which  is  not  a cipher.  On  this  basis,  then,  a Baconian  “cipher 
system”  would  be  an  “enigmaplan,”  the  verb  for  its  obscuration  would  be 
“enigmalyze,”  and  the  result  would  be  an  “enigmaduction”— a term  every  bit 
as  graceful,  as  purebred,  and  as  well  constructed  as  that  which  it  denotes. 

The  more  important  of  these  enigmaplans  have  come  under  the  cool 
scrutiny  of  the  Friedmans  in  The  Shakespearean  Ciphers  Examined  (a  nice 
anapestic  trimeter  of  a publisher’s  title  which  they  dislike  because  it  implies 
that  ciphers  exist  in  Shakespeare).  In  its  uncondensed  form,  this  book  won  the 
Folger  Shakespeare  Library  Literature  Prize  of  $1,000  in  1955.  The  Fried- 
mans pointed  out  that,  unlike,  say,  a professor  of  English,  they  had  “no 
professional  or  emotional  stake  in  any  particular  claim  to  the  authorship  of 
Shakespeare’s  plays”  and  that  the  anti-Shakespearean  “claims  based  on 
cryptography  can  be  scientifically  examined,  and  proved  or  disproved.”  They 
say  that  they  will  accept  as  valid  any  cipher  that  fulfills  two  conditions:  that 
its  plaintext  make  sense,  and  that  this  plaintext  be  unique  and  unambiguous— 
that,  in  other  words,  it  not  be  one  of  several  possible  results.  So  saying,  they 
set  out  to  see  if  anyone  had  discovered  valid  cryptologic  proof  that  Non- 
Shakespeare  wrote  Shakespeare. 

They  find  no  such  proof.  But  they  have  a fascinating  trip.  They  pass 
through  a surrealist  landscape  where  logic  and  the  events  of  history  both 
resemble  and  do  not  resemble  the  real  things,  like  the  oozing  watch  of  Salvador 
Dali,  where  supermen  of  literature  outperform  the  most  harried  of  hacks  in 
volume  and  the  most  thoughtful  of  philosophers  in  profundity— and  then  sit 
up  nights  enciphering  secret  messages  to  tell  about  it,  where  enigmatologists 
frantically  nail  together  wild  tottering  structures  upon  the  quicksands  of 
conjecture.  Though  sometimes  reviled  by  the  natives,  the  Friedmans  never 
lose  their  composure.  As  guides,  they  are  wise,  courteous,  and  quite  enter- 
taining. 

They  introduce  their  readers  to  Orville  Ward  Owen,  a Detroit  physician. 
His  basic  tool  was  a “cipher  wheel,”  which  consisted  of  1,000  pages  of 
Elizabethan  writing  glued  onto  1,000  feet  of  canvas  wound  on  two  giant 
spools.  With  its  help,  he  enigmalyzed  from  those  pages  an  autobiography  in 
which  Francis  Bacon  revealed  that  he  was  the  natural  son  of  Queen  Elizabeth 
and  Robert  Dudley,  Earl  of  Leicester,  and  had  written  not  only  the  works  of 
Shakespeare  but  those  of  Christopher  Marlowe,  Edmund  Spenser,  Robert 
Burton  ( Anatomy  of  Melancholy  only),  George  Peele,  and  Robert  Greene. 
Indeed,  he  had  done  so  primarily  to  conceal  the  story  that  Owen  laid  bare. 
Owen’s  enigmaplan  depended  upon  four  key  words,  FORTUNE,  HONOR, 
NATURE,  and  REPUTATION.  The  Friedmans  summarized  its  rules  as: 
“first  find  one  of  your  key  words  (or  one  of  its  various  derivatives);  then  look 
for  a suitable  text  somewhere  near  the  place  where  it  occurs;  and  if  you  find 
one  which  fits  into  the  story  as  you  want  it  to  be,  there  you  are  another 
triumph  of  decipherment.”  That  Owen  drew  one  enigmaduction  from  a trans- 


880 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


lation  prepared  22  years  after  Bacon’s  death  only  confirmed  the  immortality 
of  the  Lord  Chancellor’s  genius.  Owen  learned  that  Bacon  left  the  original 
manuscripts  of  the  plays  in  a set  of  iron  boxes  on  the  grounds  of  Chepstow 
Castle  in  England.  He  went  there  and  excavated,  shifting  his  spot  several 
times  as  the  enigmaplan  issued  varying  instructions.  No  manuscripts  were 
found. 

Some  Baconians  claim  to  have  discovered  “cipher  signatures”  of  their 
hero  in  the  Shakespeare  plays.  Walter  Conrad  Arensberg,  a wealthy  Phila- 
delphian, showed  that  for  hundreds  of  years  millions  of  readers  had  been 
blind  to  Bacon’s  authorship  when  he  found  such  a signature  in  Polonius’ 
famous  advice  to  Laertes  ( Hamlet  I.  iii.  70-73): 

Costly  thy  habit  as  thy  purse  can  buy; 

But  not  exprest  in  fancie;  rich,  not  gawdie: 

For  the  Apparell  oft  proclaimes  the  man. 

And  they  in  France  of  the  best  ranck  and  station,  . . . 

“Consider  in  these  lines,”  wrote  Arensberg,  “the  following  acrostic  letters: 

Co 

B 

F 

An 

Read:  F.  Bacon.” 

The  Friedmans  refuted  this  sort  of  nonsense  by  painstakingly  counting  the 
initial  letters  of  20,000  lines  of  the  First  Folio.  They  calculated  that  chance 
would  assemble  the  letters  b,  a,  c,  o,  and  n in  that  order  only  0.0244  times  in  the 
approximately  100,000  lines  of  the  First  Folio.  Significantly,  Arensberg  did 
not  find  any  such  straight  acrostic.  Instead,  he  had  to  widen  his  field  to  include 
second  letters,  such  variants  as  “Baco”  and  “F.  Baco,”  and  anagrammed 
forms  of  these.  This  promptly  brought  the  pure-chance  probabilities  well 
within  the  range  of  the  First  Folio — and  it  is  these  that  Arensberg  “dis- 
covered.” If  a die  turns  up  a deuce  1,000  times  out  of  6,000  throws,  can  this 
prove  more  than  that  what  will  probably  happen  has  indeed  happened? 

In  their  discussion  of  William  Stone  Booth’s  “string  cipher”  (which, 
incidentally,  bears  no  relation  to  the  string  cipher  for  which  it  was  named), 
the  Friedmans  pointed  out  time  and  again  how  the  enigmatologists  stretch, 
ignore,  or  break  their  own  rules  when  these  stand  in  the  way  of  a needed 
enigmaduction.  They  cast  a skeptical  eye  upon  the  many  anagrams  of  the 
longest  word  in  Shakespeare,  found  in  the  Clown’s  remark  (Loves  Labour's 
Lost  V.  i),  “I  marvell  thy  M[aster],  hath  not  eaten  thee  for  a word,  for  thou 
art  not  so  long  by  the  head  as  honorificabilitudinitatibus:  Thou  art  easier 
swallowed  then  a flapdragon.”  Sir  Edwin  Durning-Lawrence  enigmalyzed  it 
to  the  Latin  Hi  lu-cli  F Ba-co-nis  na-ti  tui-ti  or-bi  (“These  plays,  F.  Bacon’s 
offspring,  are  preserved  for  the  world”).  The  Friedmans  proved  these  off- 


881 


The  Pathology  of  Cryptology 

spring  to  be  illegitimate  by  citing  a quantity  of  other,  equally  valid  anagrams 
of  this  word,  one  of  which,  by  its  very  presence,  hints  that  Dante,  who  died 
two  hundred  years  before  Shakespeare  was  born,  may  have  rather  literally 
ghost-written  the  Bard’s  plays:  Ubi  Italicus  ibi  Danti  honor  fit  (“Where  there 
is  an  Italian,  there  honor  is  paid  to  Dante”). 

Some  of  the  gayest  moments  in  cryptology  come  when  the  Friedmans 
disprove  some  enigmaplans  by  showing  that  they  are  so  loosely  constructed 
that  they  can  render  multiple  enigmaductions.  In  the  poem  To  the  Reader 
underneath  the  famous  Droeshout  portrait  of  Shakespeare  in  the  First  Folio, 
one  Edward  D.  Johnson  saw  a symmetrical  diagram  of  22  letters  that  when 
rearranged  spelled,  for  him,  the  25-letter  ejaculation  Fr  Bacon  author  author 
author.  The  triple  repetition  must  have  bolstered  his  confidence,  for  he  issued 
a challenge:  “If  after  checking  the  signatures  ...  the  reader  is  still  of  the 
opinion  that  they  are  all  accidental,  the  writer  would  ask  him  to  try  a small 
experiment.  Let  him  take  from  any  book,  ancient  or  modern,  20  consecutive 
lines  of  prose  or  poetry,  place  the  letters  in  a Table,  and  then  try  to  see  if  he 
can  make  up  any  word  out  of  the  letters  the  same  distance  apart  in  the  text 
in  the  form  of  a chain.” 

The  Friedmans  found  it  “hard  to  resist  this  courteous  request.  We  decided 
to  use  the  text  of  one  of  Johnson’s  own  examples;  and  the  poem  ‘To  the 
Reader’  divulged  the  message  ‘No  kidding,  Francis  Bacon:  I wrote  these 
plaies ! — Shakespeare.’  . . . Our  message  is  nearly  twice  the  length  of  John- 
son’s; it  is  a complete  sentence;  and  it  uses  each  letter  of  the  diagram  once 
and  only  once.  But  the  disadvantage  of  this  ‘method’  comes  out  very  clearly 
here.  Since  our  chosen  letters  do  not  have  to  ‘appear  in  their  correct  order 
(i.e.,  we  can  arrange  them  any  way  we  please),  there  may  be  several  alternative 
‘messages’  to  choose  from : amongst  them,  one  (giving  a very  different  sense 
to  the  pattern)  runs:  ‘No  kidding!  I,  Francis  Bacon,  wrote  these  Shakespeare 
plaies.’  This  alone  is  enough  to  show  that  Johnson’s  method  is  worthless  as  a 
piece  of  cryptography.” 

Indeed  it  is.  Virtually  all  the  Baconian  enigmaplans  suffer  from  the  grave 
weakness  of  multiple  answers,  as  the  Friedmans  amply  demonstrate.  This 
fault  instantly  vitiates  any  alleged  method  of  secret  communication.  For  such 
a method,  though  intended  to  be  secret,  is  first  and  foremost  a method  of  com- 
munication. Of  what  value  is  it  if  the  encipherer  can  never  be  sure  that  the 
message  he  puts  in  will  be  the  one  the  decipherer  will  get  out?  If  Walter 
Raleigh  inserted  into  Julius  Caesar  a message  beginning  Dear  Reader:  The 
Asse  Will  Shakespeare  brought  William  Hatton  down  to  his  grave  to  prove 
Bacon’s  authorship,  as  the  economist  Wallace  McC.  Cunningham  asserted  he 
did,  and  the  Friedmans,  attempting  to  extract  it  by  the  rather  vague  rules  that 
Cunningham  said  Raleigh  used,  read  instead  Dear  Reader:  Theodore  Roose- 
velt is  the  true  author  of  this  play  . . . Friedman  can  prove  that  this  is  so  by  this 
cock-eyed  cypher , what  good  did  all  of  Raleigh  s work  do? 

Practical  considerations  such  as  that  rarely  trouble  the  Baconians.  Nor  do 


882 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 

they  often  deign  to  answer  these  criticisms.  When  they  do,  their  defense 
usually  resembles  a remark  that  Arensberg  made.  The  Friedmans  had  just 
used  his  enigmaplan  to  enigmalyze  The  author  was  William  F.  Friedman  from 
one  of  Arensberg’s  own  books  to  show  him  the  invalidity  of  it  all.  Replied  he 
with  equanimity:  “What  you  have  done  does  not  disprove  the  presence  of 
the  sentence  The  author  was  Francis  Bacon  which  1 found  in  The  Tempest .” 
But  the  sentence  is  not  present  in  The  Tempest.  Arensberg  imposed  it  upon  the 
thousands  of  letters  that  make  up  the  play.  It  is  like  looking  up  at  the  hundreds 
of  stars  in  the  night  sky  and  projecting  upon  a few  neighboring  ones  the 
image  of  some  mythic  hero  or  animal.  Orion  and  Pegasus  exist  only  in  the 
mind  of  the  beholder,  as  does  Arensberg’s  sentence.  The  proof  is  that  other 
minds,  like  the  Friedmans’,  may  organize  other  patterns. 

Enigmatology  resembles  nothing  so  much  as  the  Rorschach  tests  given 
by  psychologists,  in  which  a subject  tells  what  he  sees  in  an  ink  blot.  The  blot 
is  formless,  of  course,  and  so  anything  that  the  subject  reports  can  come  only 
from  within  himself.  The  test  thus  discloses  a great  deal  to  the  psychologist. 
To  the  enigmatologists,  the  Shakespearean  plays  may  serve  as  a kind  of 
literary  Rorschach — and  the  snobbery  and  the  fantasies  of  incest  and  adultery 
that  appear  in  many  enigmaductions  may  themselves  be  revelatory.  This  may 
partly  explain  the  great  emotional  involvement  of  Baconians  in  their  theories. 
Certain  it  is  that  to  think  that  these  mental  pictures,  whether  inspired  by  ink 
blots  or  stars  or  letters,  exist  in  external  reality  is  to  be  out  of  touch  with  that 
particular  area  of  reality. 

One  system  of  steganography,  and  one  alone,  of  all  those  applied  by  the 
Baconians  to  the  First  Folio,  is  valid.  It  has  a special  attraction,  for  it  was 
invented  by  Francis  Bacon  himself  “in  our  youth,  when  we  were  at  Paris,"  or 
some  time  between  the  ages  of  15  and  18  during  his  service  under  the  English 
ambassador  from  1576  to  1579. 

He  alluded  to  it  in  1605  in  his  Of  the  proficience  and  advancement  of  Learn- 
ing, divine  and  humane.  In  discussing  “cyphars,”  he  wrote,  in  a statement  that 
has  become  classic  in  cryptology,  that  “the  vertues  of  them,  whereby  they  are 
to  be  preferred,  are  three;  that  they  be  not  laborious  to  write  and  read;  that 
they  bee  impossible  to  discypher;  and  in  some  cases,  that  they  bee  without 
suspition.  The  highest  Degree  whereof,  is  to  write  omnia  per  omnia  [anything 
by  anything];  which  is  undoubtedly  possible,  with  a proportion  Quintuple  at 
most,  of  the  writing  infoulding,  to  the  writing  infoulded,  and  no  other  res- 
trainte  whatsoever.”  He  did  not  expand  this  ellipsis  until  the  publication,  in 
1623,  of  De  Augmentis  Scientarum,  an  enlarged  Latin  version  of  the  Advance- 
ment. This  influential  volume,  whose  classification  of  the  sciences  shaped 
man’s  view  of  human  knowledge  for  nearly  two  centuries,  subsumed  “ciphers” 
under  writing,  which  he  considered  a branch  of  grammar,  which  in  turn 
formed  “the  organ”  of  the  “traditive  doctrine,  which  takes  in  all  the  arts 
relating  to  words  and  discourse.”  From  here  Bacon  ascended  the  epistemo- 


883 


The  Pathology  of  Cryptology 

logical  ladder  via  rungs  of  logic,  faculties  of  the  soul,  human  philosophy, 
knowledge  of  man,  and  philosophy  to  encompass  at  last  all  learning.  At  62, 
he  felt  his  own  system  “a  thing  that  yet  seemeth  to  us  not  worthy  to  be  lost” 
and  so  gave  it  place  in  this  grand  design. 

He  began  by  replacing  the  24  letters  of  his  alphabet  (Bacon  naturally 
used  both  / and  j and  u and  v interchangeably)  by  permutations  of  two  symbols, 
a and  b,  taken  five  at  a time: 


a 

AAAAA

Thus  but  becomes  aaaab  baabb  baaba.  He  needed  five  places  because  two 
things  taken  five  at  a time  produce  25  or  32  permutations,  whereas  taken  four 
at  a time  they  yield  24  or  only  16,  too  few  lor  all  the  letters.  Modern  termi- 
nology would  call  this  a quinquiliteral  binary  alphabet,  and  modern  notation 
would  replace  the  a’s  and  b’s  by  0 s and  1 s,  so  that  d would  be  00011,  but 
Bacon  called  it  “bi-literal,”  and  the  name  has  stuck.  He  went  on:  “Neither 
is  it  a small  matter  these  Cypher-Characters  have,  and  may  pertorme:  For 
by  this  Art  a way  is  opened,  whereby  a man  may  expresse  and  signifie  the  in- 
tentions of  his  minde,  at  any  distance  of  place,  by  objects  which  may  be

be  capable  of  a twofold  difference  onely;  as  by  Bells,  by  Trumpets,  by  Lights 
and  Torches,  by  the  report  of  Muskets,  and  any  instruments  of  like  nature.” 
The  raising  of  a torch  could  signify  a,  its  lowering  b.  The  teletypewriter 
utilizes  Bacon's  binary  principle  by  sending  five  marks  or  spaces  within  a 
given  time  to  represent  a letter  (though  its  equivalents  differ  from  his). 

The  conversion  of  a message  to  biliteral  form  is  only  the  first  step  in 
Bacon’s  scheme  to  write  “without  suspition.”  This  scheme  requires  a cover- 
text.  Now,  among  the  objects  “capable  of  two  differences  are  faces  ot  printing 
type.  These  come  not  just  in  two  but  in  scores  of  different  styles,  usually 
named  for  their  designers,  as  Caslon,  Baskerville,  Bodoni,  Garamond,  each 
with  its  roman  and  its  italic.  Bacon’s  system  can  be  most  clearly  illustrated 
however,  by  using  the  roman  and  the  italic  forms  of  the  present  typeface  as  if 
they  were  different  faces.  The  a’s  of  the  hidden  message  become  roman  letters 
in  the  cover-text,  and  the  b's  of  the  hidden  message  become  italic  letters  in  the 
cover-text.  Thus,  the  cover-text  "Do  not  go  till  I come  would  represent  the 
hidden  message  fly,  which  is  aabab  ababa  babba,  by  setting  the  D and  the  o in 
roman,  the  n in  italic,  the  o in  roman  again,  the  t in  italic,  and  so  on,  like  this : 

A A BAB  AB  ABAB  A BB  A - 

Do  not  go  t /"  1 / I come 

The  cover-text  says  exactly  the  opposite  of  the  hidden  message:  it  is,  ot  course, 
entirely  independent  of  it.  and  this  is  what  Bacon  means  when  he  icleis  to 
writing  “omnia  per  omnia,  or  anything  by  anything.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


This  example  is  not  very  subtle  because  of  the  obvious  difference  between 
the  roman  and  italic  type  styles.  Bacon’s  original  suggestion  was,  however, 
not  to  use  two  strongly  contrasting  forms  of  the  same  typeface,  but  to  use 
two  separate  typefaces  with  only  slight  differences  between  them,  one  face 
for  the  a’s,  the  other  for  the  b’s.  If  these  two  resemble  one  another  as  closely 
as  do,  for  example,  Caslon  and  Baskerville,  the  ordinary  reader  might  never 
even  suspect  the  presence  of  the  two.  The  decipherer,  of  course,  would  have  to 
observe  some  very  fine  differences  in  the  shading  and  curvature  and  dimen- 
sions of,  say,  the  lowercase  r’s  in  the  two  faces  so  that  he  will  be  able  to  dis- 
tinguish the  A r from  the  b r.

One  of  Francis  Bacon's  own  examples  of  his  biliteral  cipher,  in  which  plaintext  Fuge 
(“ Flee ”)  is  concealed  under  covertext  manere  te  volo  donec  venero  (“Stay  till  I 
come  to  you ”).  Note  the  difference  between  the  \-form  and  the  R-forni  e’.y  in  Manere 

Yet  the  procedure  is  valid.  If  the  encipherer  prevails  upon  a friendly, 
patient  printer  to  set  type  following  copy  suitably  marked,  the  message  that 
he  inserts  will  be  the  one  that  the  decipherer  extracts.  There  will  be  no 
ambiguities,  no  looseness,  no  multiplicity  of  decipherments.  What  is  com- 
monly called  the  “Bacon  biliteral  cipher”  is  therefore  in  no  way  an  enigma- 
plan,  but  a true  system  of  steganography,  and  an  exceedingly  clever  and  use- 
ful one  at  that.  Technically,  a message  in  it  would  fall  into  the  category  of  the 
semagram,  for  its  substitutes  are  not  really  the  letters  of  the  cover-text  but 
the  forms  or  shapes  of  those  letters. 

It  was  only  natural  that  Baconians  should  turn  to  their  hero’s  own  system 
in  an  attempt  to  prove  their  case.  The  first  enigmaduction  based  on  it  to  see 
print  applied  it,  not,  however,  to  the  First  Folio  but  to  an  “uncouth  mixture 
of  large  and  small  letters”  that  uncertain  tradition  records  as  the  inscription 
of  the  original  Shakespeare  tombstone  at  Stratford.  The  carving  of  the 
epitaph  seemed  made  to  order  for  the  Baconian  biliteral: 

Good  Frend  for  Iesus  SAKE  forbeare 
To  diGG  TE  Dust  Enclo-Ased  HE.  RE. 

Blese  be  TE  Man  £ spares  TEs  Stones 
And  curst  be  He  ^ moves  my  Bones. 

In  1887,  Hugh  Black  took  the  lowercase  letters  as  A-forms  and  the  uppercase 


885 


The  Pathology  of  Cryptology 

as  B-forms.  Regarding  the  g’s  of  diGG  as  lowercase  and  the  ty  as  a single 
capital,  he  produced  saehrbayeeprftaxarawar.  “To  an  ordinary  person,”  com- 
mented the  Friedmans,  “the  resultant  message  would  be  enough  to  prove  that 
there  is  no  cipher  being  used.  The  difference  between  the  ordinary  person  and 
the  Baconian  is,  shall  we  say,  one  of  degrees  of  persistence  and  ingenuity.” 
Black  arranged  his  text  in  a special  formation,  drew  a line  to  divide  it  into 
two  parts,  anagrammed  one  part  into  Shaxpeare  and  the  other  into  Fra  Ba  wrt 
ear  ay,  and  confidently  interpreted  the  latter  to  mean  “Francis  Bacon  wrote 
Shakespeare’s  plays.” 

Black’s  work  was  emended  and  expanded  by  one  Edgar  Gordon  Clark. 
He  enigmalyzed  Fra  Ba  wryt  ear.  A A!  Shaxpere  and  Fra  Ba  wrt  ear.  HzQ  Ay  A! 
Shaxpere  out  of  the  tombstone.  These,  to  him,  meant  “Francis  Bacon  wrote 
here.  Aye  Aye!  Shakespeare”  and  “Francis  Bacon  wrote  here.  His  cue.  Aye 
Aye!  Shakespeare.”  Among  the  many  other  tombstone  enigmatologists  was 
Ignatius  Donnelly,  who  had  so  thoroughly  misconstrued  the  biliteral  early 
in  his  Baconian  career  that  he  turned  it  into  his  number  cipher,  but  later 
learned  enough  so  that  he  could  mismanage  it.  Taking  advantage  of  a 
“double-back-action  quality”  that  Bacon,  the  inventor  of  the  system,  had 
neglected  to  mention,  repeating  some  groups  and  omitting  others,  and  ana- 
gramming,  he  cheated  his  way  to  a superb  proof  of  Baconian  authorship. 
And  there  have  been  others,  equally  valid. 

In  1 899,  the  same  year  that  Donnelly’s  effort  appeared,  there  was  published 
the  first  report  of  a Baconian  cipher  message  hidden  in  the  way  that  Bacon 
himself  had  suggested — in  printed  books.  This  was  The  Bi-literal  Cypher  of 
Sir  Francis  Bacon  Discovered  in  his  Works  and  Deciphered  by  Mrs.  Elizabeth 
Wells  Gallup.  A Michigan  high  school  principal,  then  51,  Mrs.  Gallup  was  an 
honest,  gentle,  religious  woman  who  had  studied  at  the  Sorbonne  and  at  the 
University  of  Marburg.  Bacon  interested  her  and  Dr.  Owen’s  “word  cipher” 
attracted  her  and  she  worked  with  him  on  it.  She  evidently  accepted  his  results, 
for  her  own  paralleled  them,  but  rejected  his  method,  for  she  began  her  own 
search  for  a message  based  on  the  biliteral  cipher. 

Struck  by  the  variations  of  type  used  to  set  the  First  Folio,  she  studied  the 
printing  with  a magnifying  glass  to  see  if  these  differences  represented  Bacon’s 
use  of  the  biliteral  cipher.  Since  the  differences  are  sharpest  in  the  italic  letters, 
she  tried  first  to  decipher  the  Prologue  to  Troilus  and  Cressida,  which  is  almost 
entirely  in  italic  in  the  First  Folio.  Slowly  and  painstakingly,  she  drew  from 
that  page  and  from  others  bits  and  pieces  of  a sensational  life  story  of  Bacon 
quite  similar  to  the  biography  enigmalyzed  by  Owen,  and  soon  found  that  it 
was  continued,  also  in  biliteral  form,  in  the  books  of  Marlowe,  Jonson, 
Spenser,  Burton,  Peele,  and  Greene,  all  of  whom  served,  as  in  Owen’s  work, 
as  masks  for  Bacon.  The  tale  skipped  about  from  place  to  place;  a sentence 
broken  off  in  one  book  resumed  in  another;  and  the  substance  repeated  over 
and  over  again,  as  if  Bacon  were  making  sure  that  at  least  one  message  would 
be  found. 


886  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Mrs.  Gallup  found  the  nub  of  the  story  in  the  “Catalogue,”  or  table  of 
contents,  of  the  First  Folio: 

Queene  Elizabeth  is  my  true  mother,  and  I am  the  lawfull  heire  to  the  throne. 

Finde  the  Cypher  storie  my  bookes  contain;  it  tells  great  secrets,  every  one  of 

which,  if  imparted  openly,  would  forfeit  my  life.  F.  Bacon. 

Bacon’s  father  was  Robert  Dudley,  the  Earl  of  Leicester,  Mrs.  Gallup  dis- 
covered, and  she  drew  forth  a hair-raising  tale  of  how  Elizabeth,  “unwilling 
in  th’  seventh  month  to  proclaim  herself  a woman  wedded  and  pregnante,” 
gave  birth  to  the  unwanted  child  whom  she  later  entrusted  to  Nicholas 
Bacon  for  upbringing:  “.  . . she  who  bore  me,  even  in  the  hour  of  my  un- 
welcom’d coming,  outraging  every  instinct  of  a naturall  woman,  in  the  pangs 
and  perills  of  her  travail  cherisht  one  infernal  purpose.  ‘Kill,  kill,’  cried  this 
madden’d  woman,  ‘kill.’  ” 

The  publication  of  the  book  stirred  great  interest,  as  do  nearly  all  reports 
of  new  “proofs”  of  Baconian  authorship  of  Shakespeare.  A second  edition 
appeared  in  1900  and  a third  in  1902.  Mrs.  Gallup  was  berated;  she  replied 
mildly.  The  most  sensible  statement  in  the  uproar  was  that  the  Baconian  con- 
troversy had  been  shifted  to  new  ground.  In  1907  she  sailed  for  England  to 
look  for  manuscripts  that  her  readings  told  her  were  in  Canonbury  Tower  in 
London,  where  Bacon  once  lived,  or  in  his  country  home  at  Gorhambury.  But 
the  first  was  reconstructed,  the  second  in  ruins  and,  no  more  than  Dr.  Owen, 
who  was  digging  at  the  same  time,  did  she  find  any  manuscripts. 

After  her  return  to  the  United  States  a few  years  later,  she  was  hired  by 
George  Fabyan  to  work  at  his  Riverbank  Laboratories  in  Geneva,  Illinois, 
and  “decipher”  the  manuscripts  there,  with  the  assistance  of  a staff  and 
photographic  equipment  for  enlarging  the  letters  of  the  First  Folio.  The 
wealthy  Fabyan  hoped  to  be  revered  as  a literary  pioneer  after  the  expected 
Baconian  victory;  he  had  financed  Owen’s  excavations  and  had  been  intro- 
duced to  Mrs.  Gallup  by  a mutual  friend.  In  his  campaign  to  “sell”  her  work 
to  the  academic  world,  he  invited  prominent  scholars  to  Riverbank  at  his 
expense,  fed,  housed,  and  entertained  them  at  his  villa,  treated  them  on  their 
first  day  to  a well-organized  lantern-slide  lecture  on  the  biliteral  cipher,  urged 
them  to  observe  the  staff  at  work  and  to  talk  with  Mrs.  Gallup,  and  reiterated 
the  need  to  keep  an  open  mind.  Mrs.  Gallup  remained  at  Riverbank  until  a 
few  years  before  her  death  in  1934  at  87;  during  all  those  years  she  never  pro- 
duced another  “decipherment.” 

The  Laboratories’  staff  members  were  told,  however,  that  she  was  working 
on  Bacon’s  New  Atlantis.  Among  her  assistants  was  William  F.  Friedman. 
Though  head  of  the  Riverbank  Department  of  Genetics,  he  helped  make 
the  photographic  enlargements.  Instead  of  clarifying  the  slight  differences 
between  the  A and  b forms  of  the  letters,  however,  the  enlargements  obscured 
them,  because  many  proved  to  be  the  result  of  damaged  type,  imperfections 
in  the  paper,  poor  presswork,  or  ink-spread  around  the  actual  printed  letter. 


887 


The  Pathology  of  Cryptology 

Nevertheless,  the  work  went  on.  Elizebeth  Smith,  the  future  Mrs.  Fried- 
man, collated  the  A and  b assignments  of  the  other  workers  on  the  basis  of  a 
tally  and  attempted  to  read  the  secret  message.  When,  as  invariably  hap- 
pened, she  failed  to  get  more  than  a word  or  two,  she  brought  the  text  to  Mrs. 
Gallup,  who  produced  extensive  readings  with  little  apparent  effort.  When 
Miss  Smith  would  say,  “But  you  must  have  changed  some  of  the  assignments,” 
Mrs.  Gallup  would  point  out  that  the  group  had  missed  the  position  of  the 
dot  over  an  i or  some  similar  minutia.  Miss  Smith,  who  at  first  admired  Mrs. 
Gallup’s  acute  facility  in  extracting  intelligence  from  what  she  herself  could 
see  only  as  gibberish,  found  her  admiration  turning  to  “uneasy  questioning, 
and  then  to  agonizing  doubt,  and  then  to  downright  disbelief.  1 can  state 
categorically  that  neither  1 nor  any  other  one  of  the  industrious  research 
workers  at  Riverbank  ever  succeeded  in  extracting  a single  long  sentence  of  a 
hidden  message;  nor  did  one  of  us  so  much  as  reproduce,  independently,  a 
single  complete  sentence  which  Mrs.  Gallup  had  already  deciphered  and 
published.” 

This  tells  heavily  against  the  Gallup  results.  If  the  biliteral  cipher  were 
present,  all  decipherers  should  be  able  to  obtain  the  same  message.  That  her 
results  were  at  least  partially  subjective  she  conceded  in  her  admission  that  “1 
sometimes  think  inspiration”  is  “absolutely  essential.”  Critics  leveled  objec- 
tions at  the  use  of  words  in  her  texts  in  senses  they  did  not  have  in  Bacon’s 
time,  and  at  such  barbarous  abbreviations  as  adoptio ’ and  ciphe'  that  no  one 
but  she  ever  used.  Her  “decipherments”  in  general  have  a vague  pointlessness : 
“Seeke  the  keyes  untill  all  bee  found.  Turne  Time  into  an  ever  present,  faith- 
full  companion,  friend,  guide,  light,  and  way.  For  he  who  seeks  an  entrance 
here,  must  be  furnished  in  that  manner  aforesaid.”  Was  this  the  secret  mes- 
sage, the  primary  text  to  which  the  plays,  with  all  their  soaring  eloquence  and 
profundity,  were  but  secondary?  Would  Bacon  have  spent  so  much  of  his 
time  enciphering  this  drivel,  and  expended  so  much  of  his  cash  to  have  a 
printer  set  it  in  the  painstaking  manner  required?  Would  one  of  the  most 
acute  thinkers  and  most  pithy  of  English  writers  (who  on  the  Baconian  theory 
also  composed  the  poetry  of  Shakespeare)  have  considered  such  maunderings 
his  greatest  secret?  No  open-minded  man  will  believe  so. 

Even  the  slight  possibility  that  this  is  so  is  eliminated  by  the  technical 
criticisms  that  utterly  demolish  the  Gallup  “decipherment.”  Dr.  Fred  M. 
Miller,  a document  expert  of  the  F.B.I.  whom  the  Friedmans  had  interested  in 
the  problem,  pointed  out  that  Mrs.  Gallup  was  notoriously  inconsistent  in  her 
letter  assignments.  For  example,  some  of  her  A-form  t's  resembled  B-form  t's 
more  than  they  do  other  A-form  t’s.  The  Friedmans,  checking  up,  caught  her 
frequently  adding  or  dropping  letters  of  the  cover-text.  And  finally,  they 
found  that  she  did  not  consistently  “decipher”  the  same  pieces  of  type  the 
same  way.  Printers  pick  up  the  type  of  the  page  headings  from  one  form  and 
use  it  for  other  signatures;  the  identical  type  should  result  in  identical  deciph- 
erments. With  bibliographical  help,  the  Friedmans  identified  the  lifted  head- 


888 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


ings  and  found  that  more  often  than  not  (in  the  first  21  pages  of  the  First 
Folio)  Mrs.  Gallup’s  “decipherments”  of  them  varied. 

This  devastating  analysis  consigned  her  “solution”  to  the  dustbin  of 
enigmaduction,  but  it  did  not  deny  the  possible  existence  of  a biliteral  cipher 
in  the  First  Folio;  Mrs.  Gallup  may  simply  have  misread  it.  The  Friedmans, 
however,  assembled  expert  evidence  to  show  that  none  does. 

Experts  in  printing  showed  that  the  printers  of  the  time  changed  authors’ 
spellings  in  order  to  justify  lines  more  easily;  this  practice  would  break  up  the 
even  flow  of  the  biliteral.  Poor  inking  made  letters  printed  from  the  same 
piece  of  type  look  as  if  they  had  been  printed  from  different  ones.  Paper  was 
dampened  before  printing;  it  often  dried  unevenly  and  shrank  identical  letters 
to  different  sizes.  Frequently,  closed  letters  like  a,  e,  o filled  with  ink,  obscur- 
ing differences.  And  Dr.  Charlton  Hinman,  who  has  collated  dozens  of  First 
Folios  letter  by  letter  and  traced  hundreds  of  distinctive  pieces  of  type  through 
their  pages  for  his  massive  typographical  study,  The  Printing  and  Proof- 
reading of  the  First  Folio  of  Shakespeare,  has  found  that  any  given  copy 
contains  “large  numbers  of  variant  readings”  as  a result  of  the  customary 
printing  practice  of  the  time.  Consequently,  no  biliteral  message  would  have 
been  transmitted  with  absolute  fidelity.  His  studies  “have  certainly  revealed 
nothing  to  encourage  the  idea — to  put  it  in  very  moderate  terms — that  the 
book  contains  biliteral  cipher.”  All  these  points  militate  against  any  prob- 
ability of  its  use  in  the  First  Folio. 

Conclusive  proof  that  it  was  in  fact  not  used  came  from  two  experts.  One 
was  Frederick  W.  Goudy,  one  of  America’s  most  distinguished  typographers. 
Fabyan  had  commissioned  him  in  1920  to  look  into  the  possibility  of  a 
biliteral  cipher  in  the  First  Folio — and  then  had  suppressed  the  report.  For 
Goudy,  himself  a designer  of  typefaces,  had  measured,  sketched,  analyzed, 
and  compared  the  letters  of  the  First  Folio,  and  had  concluded  that  a multi- 
plicity of  typefaces  had  been  used,  not  just  the  two  that  the  biliteral  required. 
(This  finding,  incidentally,  accorded  with  the  then  current  practices  of 
English  printing,  which  had  fallen  to  a low  estate.)  Independently,  the  F.B.I.’s 
Dr.  Miller  concurred:  “No  characteristics  were  found  which  support  the 
classification  into  two  fonts,  such  as  A-font  and  B-font.” 

It  may  put  the  Baconians  into  perspective  to  recognize  that  they  are  not 
the  only  enigmatologists.  Gabriele  Rossetti,  the  19th-century  Italian  national- 
ist who  was  the  father  of  the  English  poets  Dante  Gabriele  Rossetti  and 
Christina  Rossetti,  found  in  Dante’s  Divine  Comedy  a secret  language  in 
which  a secret  society,  opposing  political  and  ecclesiastical  tyranny  from  the 
earliest  times,  expressed  its  aims  and  informed  its  members  of  its  affairs. 
Professor  David  S.  Margoliouth,  who  had  served  in  England’s  M.1. 1(b)  in 
World  War  I and  should  have  known  better,  rearranged  the  colophons  of  the 
Iliad  and  the  Odyssey  and  found  two  incantations  to  the  muse  which  neither 
appear  to  make  much  sense  nor  add  anything  to  the  epics.  Anti-Baconian  lb

The  Pathology  of  Cryptology 

Melchior  fell  victim  to  his  opponents’  obsession  and  enigmalyzed  from 
Shakespeare’s  tombstone  a message  in  alleged  Elizabethan  English  that  sup- 
posedly meant,  “Elsinore  laid  wedge  first  Hamlet  edition” ; his  enigmaduction 
enjoys  the  dubious  prestige  of  being  the  first  to  have  been  laid  low  by  Claude 
Shannon’s  unicity-point  formula.  Baconian  Pierre  Henrion  has  extended  his 
enigma  pi  an  to  Jonathan  Swift;  by  anagramming  the  nonsensical  names  in 
Gulliver’s  Travels,  substituting  letters,  and  then  anagramming  again,  he 
“proves”  that  Lemuel  gulliver  really  means  Jonathan  Swift  and  that  lilli- 
put  is  Nowhere.  A British  artillery  colonel,  H.  W.  L.  Hime,  has  deciphered 
a text  proving  that  Roger  Bacon  invented  gunpowder;  unfortunately,  while 
the  most  important  letters  of  this  text  appear  in  printed  versions  through 
some  errors,  they  do  not  exist  in  the  original  manuscript. 

Other  enigmaductions  have  been  elicited  from  the  Bible,  Chaucer,  Ari- 
stotle. Lesser  minds  have  enigmalyzed  less  exalted  texts.  Hans  Omenitsch,  an 
anti-Semite  who  lived  in  Jackson  Heights,  New  York,  found  that  the  Dick 
Tracy  comic  strip  of  April  18,  1936,  concealed  the  plaintext  Nero  mob  in  fog 
rob  Leroy  apt  rat  in  it  are  a goy.  He  had  equal  success  with  the  Harold  Teen 
comic  strip  and  ordinary  news  stories  in  various  New  York  dailies.  He 
explained  to  a Congressman:  “A  criminal  system  of  codes  is  operated  daily  in 
the  press  by  the  real  masters  of  the  country,  who  not  only  control  the  press 
and  the  politicians  in  power  but  who  also  control  and  direct  the  so-called  red 
movement  (international)  as  a sham  to  hide  their  real  operations.”  His  enig- 
maplan  was  unclear,  and  as  for  his  enigmaduction,  the  Congressman  said 
that  “it  does  not  mean  anything  to  anyone.” 

Just  as  the  Baconians  are  not  the  only  enigmatologists,  so  the  enigma- 
tologists are  not  the  only  expositors  of  false  historical  and  scientific  theories. 
Science  and  history  have  their  sicknesses,  too.  Various  groups  of  oddballs 
maintain  their  belief  in  a flat  earth,  in  a hollow  earth,  in  dowsing  rods,  in  the 
prophecies  incorporated  in  the  measurements  of  the  Great  Pyramid  of 
Cheops,  in  the  existence  of  Atlantis  (it  is  no  coincidence  that  Donnelly  fell  for 
both  this  and  the  Baconian  theory),  in  flying  saucers,  in  such  medical  cults  as 
iridiagnosis,  which  diagnoses  illnesses  from  the  appearance  of  the  iris.  The 
enigmatologists  form  but  the  literary  sector  of  this  lunatic  fringe.  Both  they 
and  the  other  pseudo  scientists  seize  upon  the  possible  as  if  it  were  the  prob- 
able, fantasize  behind  a mask  of  rationality,  multiply  entities  beyond  necessity, 
and  refuse  to  test  their  hypotheses. 

The  techniques  for  eliciting  universal  truths  from  the  Great  Pyramid 
resemble  the  Baconian  enigmaplans  so  strikingly  because  of  these  shared 
attitudes.  For  example,  one  Pyramid  theory  holds  that  its  internal  measure- 
ments embrace  practically  all  of  man  s historical  and  scientific  knowledge. 
Various  multiplications  of  measurements  of  height,  side,  the  length  ol  the 
Grand  Gallery,  and  so  on,  produce  the  dates  for  past  and  future  events  in 
world  history.  The  Creation  (4,004  b.c.),  the  Flood,  Chiist  s birth,  the  Great

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Tribulation  before  his  Second  Coming,  all  are  indicated.  Other  combinations 
yield  scientific  truths — the  distance  from  the  earth  to  the  sun,  the  earth’s 
mean  density,  the  mean  temperature  of  its  surface,  and  so  on.  With  so  many 
lengths  possible  in  so  complex  a structure,  and  no  strict  rules  to  go  by,  it  is 
obviously  possible  to  juggle  them  to  produce  figures  which  coincide  with  im- 
portant dates  or  scientific  facts.  Such  manipulations  parallel  the  undisciplined 
combining  of  letters  in  the  First  Folio  to  produce  Baconian  authorship 
proofs. 

Both  the  Baconian  and  the  Pyramid  assertions  claim  to  be  legitimate 
scientific  theories,  but  their  behavior  in  the  face  of  criticism  or  embarrassing 
fact  strips  them  of  such  pretensions.  Their  proponents  do  not  reconsider, 
request  new  tests,  submit  to  verification.  Rather,  they  vilify  their  critics, 
dodge,  equivocate,  explain  away.  Never  do  they  concede  that  they  might  be 
wrong.  When  Mrs.  Gallup,  in  a tight  corner,  had  to  read  a B-form  as  an  a- 
form  to  make  sense,  she  summoned  up  a phony  explanation  that  she  never 
had  to  use  in  any  of  her  previous  determinations:  the  wrong  form  was 
deliberately  inserted  to  confuse  because  “ciphers  are  made  to  hide  things,  not 
discover  them.”  When  the  Friedmans  knocked  enigmaplans  wholesale  into  a 
cocked  hat,  the  Baconians  suddenly  came  up  with  something  that  not  one 
had  ever  mentioned : “while  an  Elizabethan  cipher  may  be  considered  invalid 
by  modern  standards  of  rigid  cryptography,  it  may  well  have  provided  its 
institutors  with  a fairly  safe  method  of  recording  historical  facts,  or  personal 
opinions,  which  they  could  not  express  without  grave  risk.  An  Elizabethan 
cryptogram  may  be  suggestive  rather  than  conclusive,  and  these  suggestions 
may  ultimately,  by  their  very  frequency,  command  assent.”  Not  an  iota  of 
evidence  exists  for  this,  outside  of  the  Baconian  claims  themselves,  and  it  is 
safe  to  say  that  for  every  Baconian  “suggestion”  drawn  forth,  someone 
could,  if  he  wanted  to,  extract  an  equivalent  Shakespearean  one.  But  it  would 
be  as  idle  to  do  so  as  to  talk  back  to  a phonograph.  For  the  Baconians  do  not 
seek  knowledge — they  have  the  faith;  they  are  not  scholars,  but  advocates. 

The  situation  which  the  enigmatologists  and  the  other  pseudo  scientists 
exemplify  almost  ideally  is  not  at  all  uncommon,  and  philosophers  have 
examined  it  often.  A.  J.  Ayer  of  Oxford  is  especially  clear:  “A  man  can  always 
sustain  his  convictions  in  the  face  of  apparently  hostile  evidence  if  he  is  pre- 
pared to  make  the  necessary  ad  hoc  assumptions.  But  although  any  particular 
instance  in  which  a cherished  hypothesis  appears  to  be  refuted  can  always  be 
explained  away,  there  must  still  remain  the  possibility  that  the  hypothesis  will 
ultimately  be  abandoned.  Otherwise  it  is  not  a genuine  hypothesis.  For  a 
proposition  whose  validity  we  are  resolved  to  maintain  in  the  face  of  any 
experience  is  not  a hypothesis  at  all,  but  a definition.” 

The  Baconians  so  maintain  their  view.  They  insist  that  their  theory  is  true, 
but  if  it  may  be  true  it  may  also  be  false,  and  this  they  will  not  concede.  For 
upon  what  evidence  would  they  abandon  their  assertions?  The  finding  of  a 
holograph  of  Hamlet  ? If  experience  is  any  guide,  they  would  say  that  Shake- 


891 


The  Pathology  of  Cryptology 

speare  copied  it  out  at  Bacon’s  orders.  The  discovery  of  a note  by  Bacon  that 
he  hated  Shakespeare’s  plays  and  would  have  nothing  to  do  with  such  clap- 
trap? Obviously  a clever  trick  to  throw  contemporaries  off  the  trail.  The 
Baconians  cannot  lose.  But  then  they  cannot  claim  to  have  won,  either. 

People  ask,  “Does  it  matter  who  wrote  the  Shakespeare  plays?  After  all, 
it  is  the  plays  themselves  that  count,  not  who  wrote  them.”  It  matters  because 
truth  matters.  The  Baconian  error  has  implications  far  beyond  the  Bacon- 
Shakespeare  question.  “If  one  can  argue  that  the  evidence  in  Shakespeare’s 
case  does  not  mean  what  it  says,”  a scholar  has  written,  “that  it  has  been 
falsified  to  sustain  a gigantic  hoax  that  has  remained  undetected  for  centuries, 
then  one  can  just  as  surely  argue  that  other  evidence  is  not  to  be  trusted  and 
that,  as  Henry  Ford  said,  ‘history  is  bunk.’  ” 

It  is  as  pointless  to  try  to  convince  the  Baconians  of  this  on  rational 
grounds  as  it  would  be  to  demonstrate  to  an  inmate  of  a mental  hospital, 
with  pictures  of  Napoleon’s  funeral  and  tomb  and  attested  documents  of 
Napoleon’s  death,  that  he  is  not  Napoleon.  For  neither  he  nor  the  Baconians 
hold  their  views  rationally.  They  hold  them  emotionally.  The  problem  of 
enigmatology  is,  at  heart,  not  logical  but  psychological.  This  is  not  to  say 
that  Baconians  are  psychotics — on  the  contrary,  in  non-Baconian  spheres 
they  function  adequately,  perhaps  even  outstandingly.  But  as  Baconians  they 
live  in  a fantasy  world.  Enigmaductions  are  classic  instances  of  wishful 
thinking,  of  unconscious  projection,  of  figments  of  the  imagination.  These 
results  of  an  overactive  cryptanalytic  gland,  these  bloated  growths  of  a chaotic 
imagination  are  like  cancers  on  the  corpus  of  normal  codemaking  and 
-breaking.  They  constitute  the  pathology  of  cryptology.

ANCESTRAL  VOICES 


in  the  fall  of  the  year,  the  staid  Journal  of  Hellenic  Studies  issues  its 
annual  volume.  Its  articles  examine  in  exhaustive  detail  some  lesser  points  of 
Greek  philology  or  literature— the  individual  bricks  of  scholarship  that 
raise  mankind’s  house  of  knowledge.  Their  prose  is  flat  and  unemotional, 
their  titles  restrained. 

The  volume  for  1953  contained  an  article  that  in  all  outward  forms  re- 
sembled the  others.  Its  text  was  a thicket  of  Greek  verb  endings  and  gram- 
matical forms,  its  title  as  carefully  circumscribed  as  the  others:  “Evidence  for 
Greek  Dialect  in  the  Mycenaean  Archives.”  Yet  for  many  readers  it  evoked 
the  ringing  plains  of  windy  Troy,  the  coruscating  helmets  and  dancing  horse- 
hair plumes  of  Homeric  heroes  crowding  beneath  the  walls  and  topless  towers 
of  Ilium,  and  ancient  Crete,  with  its  bull-dancer  frescoes,  its  sinister  labyrinth, 
its  Minotaur,  Theseus,  and  the  House  of  the  Double  Ax. 

For  the  article  reported  the  decipherment  of  a lost  writing,  a script  called 
Linear  B scratched  on  clay  tablets  when  Achilles  and  Agamemnon,  Helen  and 
Menelaus  walked  the  earth.  It  was  the  most  recent  in  the  long  series  of  deciph- 
erments that  have  given  tongue  to  mute  stones,  brought  to  life  Pharaoh  and 
Nineveh  and  the  panoply  of  ancient  civilizations,  allowed  ancestral  voices 
silenced  for  millennia  to  whisper  across  gulfs  of  time  and  space  to  the  men  of 
today.  Some  of  these  decipherments  must  rank  among  the  noblest  achieve- 
ments of  the  human  mind.  For  how  to  read  the  unknown  writing  of  those  long 
dead?  How  to  speak  the  words  of  those  whose  voices  murmur  only  in  the 
sighing  of  the  wind? 

The  solution  of  the  problem  shares  some  techniques  with  cryptanalysis. 
In  one  way  the  linguistic  problem  is  easier,  for  there  has  been  no  deliberate 
attempt  to  conceal,  but  in  another  way  it  is  harder,  for  sometimes  an  entire 
language  must  be  reconstructed.  In  general,  the  linguistic  problem  involves 
two  factors — the  writing  and  the  language.  Either  may  be  known  or  unknown. 
Four  cases  therefore  arise. 

In  Case  0,  both  script  and  language  are  known.  No  problem  exists:  an 
Englishman  can  read  English  in  its  customary  alphabet.  In  Case  I,  the  language 
is  known  but  not  the  writing.  This  is  the  simplest  problem,  equivalent  to  that 
of  a substitution  cipher.  If  the  writing  is  alphabetic,  the  solution  resembles 

895 


896 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


that  of  a monalphabetic  substitution ; if  syllabic,  like  kata  kana,  that  of  a 
nomenclator;  if  logographic,  like  Chinese,  that  of  a code.  In  Case  II,  the 
script  is  known  but  not  the  language.  An  American  who  does  not  know 
Italian  may  be  able  to  read  aloud  a newspaper  article  in  an  approximation  of 
that  language — but  he  will  not  understand  what  he  is  saying.  The  problem 
that  faces  the  decipherer  in  Case  II  parallels  the  one  that  would  face  an 
American  who  wanted  to  teach  himself  Italian  without  any  grammars  or  dic- 
tionaries, helped  only  by  any  pictures  that  might  accompany  the  texts,  by  an 
English  translation,  or  by  a knowledge  of  related  languages,  such  as  French, 
Spanish,  and  Latin.  Without  any  of  these  external  elements,  solution  is 
probably  not  possible.  In  Case  III,  neither  writing  nor  language  is  known.  If 
this  occurs  in  cultural  isolation,  so  that  neither  can  ever  be  known,  no  solution 
can  ever  be  reached.  But  it  has  happened  that  although  neither  is  known  at 
the  beginning  of  a study,  outside  information — usually  a proper  name  known 
from  another  culture — determines  the  sound-values  of  the  writing  system  and 
this,  with  the  help  of  a translation  or  cognate  languages,  leads  to  the  recon- 
struction of  the  language  as  well.  The  problem  resolves  into  a succession  of 
Cases  I and  II. 

Case  I solutions  sometimes  read  like  textbook  explanations  of  elementary 
cryptanalysis. 

In  the  summer  of  1946,  Edouard  Dhorme,  an  eminent  Orientalist  who  was 
a dean  at  the  Sorbonne’s  School  of  Advanced  Studies,  undertook  the  study 
of  some  inscriptions  dug  up  in  Syria  at  Byblos,  the  town  that  gave  its  name 
to  the  Bible.  The  writing  resembled  hieroglyphics,  but  it  made  no  sense  read 
that  way.  From  the  location  of  the  inscriptions  and  from  their  approximate 
age,  Dhorme  felt  confident  that  the  language  underlying  the  approximately 
100  sign-images  was  Phoenician.  The  number  of  signs  suggested  a syllabary, 
in  which  each  sign  would  represent  a syllable,  like  /ta/.  But  the  usual  Phoe- 
nician writing  followed  the  Semitic  trait  of  writing  only  the  consonantal 
skeleton — “mister,”  “master,”  “muster,”  “mystery,”  and  “mastery”  would 
all  be  written  mstr  in  the  Semitic  convention.  Since  no  one  knew  how  the 
words  sounded,  Dhorme  could  not  hope  to  recover  the  vowels  of  his  syllabary. 
But  since  the  Phoenicians  who  wrote  the  inscriptions  knew  the  vowels,  and 
presumably  used  different  signs  for,  say,  ta,  ti,  and  tu,  Dhorme  had  to  expect 
to  find  several  signs  for  what  he  would  know  only  as  t. 

These  difficulties  did  not  daunt  the  65-year-old  scholar,  who  had  been 
made  an  officer  of  the  Legion  d’Honneur  for  cryptanalytical  work  in  World 
War  I and  who  had  been  one  of  three  independent  decipherers  of  another  script 
in  1929.  He  boldly  attacked  the  Byblos  pseudo-hieroglyphics,  beginning  with 
the  assumption  that  seven  vertical  marks  in  the  lower  left  corner  of  a tablet 
represented  a regnal  date. 

I did  not  hesitate  to  give  to  the  four  signs  preceding  the  number  the  value 

b'snt,  “in  the  years,  in  the  year.”  This  hypothesis  had  the  advantage  of  permitting

me  to  ignore  the  appearance  of  the  sign  in  determining  its  [sound-]value.  All  my 
work  consisted  of  carrying  forward  these  four  letters  wherever  the  corresponding 
signs  were  found  and  of  filling  the  empty  spaces  with  cross-checkings  suggested

The  tablet  from  Byblos  that  Edouard  Dhorme  used  to  start  his  solution  of  the  pseudo- 
hieroglyphics 


by  Phoenician.  In  the  first  line  of  Tablet  C,  I found  the  group  n-s  and,  since  a 
copper  tablet  was  involved,  I reconstituted  the  word  nhs,  “copper,  bronze.”  The 
h,  thus  identified  with  the  sign  of  the  bird,  gave  me  in  lines  6 and  10  the  final  of  a 
group,  —bh,  where  I recognized  the  word  mzbh,  “altar.”  The  m thus  obtained, 
carried  forward  as  penultimate  of  line  14,  gave  me  b'tm-,  which  could  only  be 
the  designation  of  the  month  “in  Tammuz.”  I thus  had  a second  z which  I 
marked  z;.  The  month  must  have  been  preceded  by  the  mention  of  the  day.  Since 
there  was  no  number  at  all  in  line  14, 1 recognized  in  the  group  s-s  the  name  of  a 
number  and  I thought  first  of  sis,  “three.”  After  some  fruitless  trials  of  the  con- 
sonant / wherever  it  appeared,  I finally  perceived  that  the  number  was  not  sis, 
“three,”  but  actually  ids,  “six”  in  its  primitive  form.  The  d was  thus  added  to  the 
identified  signs.  The  group  following  sds  could  only  be  the  word  “days,”  in  the 
plural  like  “years”  in  line  1 5,  and  I read  this  group  ymm  ( yamim ),  which  furnished 
me  with  y and  two  other  m's.  Thus  the  filling  in  of  correct  solutions  not  only  in 
Tablet  C but  also  in  Tablet  D permitted  me  to  obtain  new  values,  always  ig- 
noring the  form  of  the  signs  and  resorting  only  to  the  suggestion  of  the  contexts.

the  eraser  are  unremittingly  in  action,  where  one  successively  carries  forward  the 
hypothetical  values  to  replace  them  with  others  which  end  by  yielding  place  to 
the  definitive  values — these  will  understand  by  what  obsessive  work  of  day  and 
night  I succeeded  in  drawing  up  my  syllabic  alphabet  and  finding  the  Phoenician 
words  which  hid  themselves  under  this  undeciphered  writing  and  were,  according 
to  the  experts,  undecipherable  without  a bilingual  text. 

Since  the  Roman  alphabet  is  derived  through  the  Greek  from  the  Phoeni- 
cian and  ultimately  from  Egyptian  hieroglyphics,  Dhorme  thought  that  his 
decipherment  placed  a new  link  “between  the  hieroglyphs  and  the  alphabets 
of  Phoenicia.”  Some  scholars  contest  this  interpretation,  but  few  doubt  that, 
as  he  said,  his  decipherment  “rendered  a hitherto  unappreciated  documenta- 
tion to  the  history  of  writing.” 

Other  Case  I solutions  have  raced  forward  with  equal  speed.  In  1928,  the 
plow  of  a native  cultivating  a field  near  the  Syrian  coast  lifted  a flagstone  and 
disclosed  a tomb;  archeologists  next  year  discovered  that  the  60-foot  mound 
called  Ras  Shamra  that  stood  nearby  marked  the  remains  of  the  ancient  city 
of  Ugarit.  In  a three-columned  chamber,  the  excavators  found  about  50  clay 
tablets,  impressed  with  an  unknown  cuneiform  writing.  This  first  find — other 
tablets  came  to  light  later — was  published  promptly  by  one  of  the  archeolo- 
gists, Dr.  Charles  Virolleaud. 

He  pointed  out  that  some  of  the  26  or  27  different  signs  resembled  those  of 
Akkadian  cuneiform  but  did  not  have  the  same  sound  values;  his  readers 
knew  that  the  Akkadian  version  (used  for  the  languages  of  Babylonia  and 
Assyria)  had  hundreds  of  signs  and  was  primarily  syllabic.  The  Ugarit  words 
were  divided  by  a short  vertical  mark.  Some  were  only  one  letter  long,  most 
two  or  three  letters  in  length,  some  four,  and  very  few  any  longer.  This 
indicated  a consonantal  script  to  Virolleaud.  He  did  not  have  to  add  that  the 
tablets  came  from  a locale  where  Semitic  languages  had  long  predominated. 

He  commented  that  the  shortest  text,  a six-sign  inscription  on  four  bronze 
ax  handles,  might  represent  the  name  of  the  owner.  A fifth  ax  handle  had  the 
same  six  signs  preceded  by  a word  of  four  letters,  which  he  said  probably 
stood  for  “ax”  or  “hatchet”  or  “pick.”  He  saw  that  a sign  of  three  vertical 
wedges  that  preceded  the  probable  names  also  appeared  in  the  first  line  of  one 
of  the  tablets,  and  he  suggested  in  his  paper  that  this  might  stand  for  the 
Semitic  letter  /,  which  means  “to.” 

Virolleaud’s  publication  came  to  the  hands  of  Dr.  Hans  Bauer  of  the 
University  of  Halle  on  April  22,  1930.  A big,  heavy  man  and  a brilliant  philo- 
logist, then  52,  who  knew  not  only  the  Western  and  Near  Eastern  languages 
but  those  of  the  Far  East  as  well,  he  set  to  work  at  once  to  try  to  solve  them. 
Like  Dhorme,  he  had  had  some  cryptanalytic  experience  in  World  War  I. 
His  technique,  in  fact,  depended  primarily  upon  statistics,  as  do  the  general 
solutions  of  cryptanalysis,  and  only  secondarily  upon  guessing  at  words  for 
the  actual  reconstruction  of  the  text — one  of  the  few  decipherments  in 
archeological  history  to  sustain  that  order  of  importance.  It  began  with  a 


Ancestral  Voices 


899 


study  of  the  letters  in  the  West  Semitic  languages  that  could  appear  as  initials, 
terminals,  or  as  one-letter  words.  Among  other  things,  this  showed  that  m,  k, 
and  w could  appear  in  all  three  places.  He  correlated  the  list  he  compiled  with 
a similar  list  that  he  made  for  the  signs  of  the  Ras  Shamra  tablets. 

Based  on  this,  he  decided  that  two  signs  could  represent  either  w or  m and 
that  two  others  could  stand  for  either  n or  t.  Then,  picking  up  Virolleaud’s 
possible  /,  he  looked  for  the  probable  word  m!k,  “king.”*  He  found  it,  and 
extended  his  decipherment  by  filling  in  other  possibilities.  Within  five  days 
he  had  recovered  20  letters.  When  he  tested  these  against  the  four-letter  word 
on  the  ax  handle  that  Virolleaud  had  thought  might  mean  “ax,”  he  produced 
grzn,  a Semitic  word  meaning  “ax.”  On  April  28  he  reported  his  recoveries  to 
the  French  archeologists.  On  June  4,  he  published  a preliminary  report  in  the 
Vossische  Zeitung  which  gave  the  values  of  t,  r,  n,  and  alef,  a guttural  sound, 
and  the  deciphered  names  of  the  gods  Ba‘al,  Astarte,  Ashera,  and  El. 

At  the  same  time,  Dhorme,  who  was  then  in  Jerusalem,  had  been  working 
on  the  texts  independently.  He,  too,  began  with  Virolleaud’s  suggestion  for  /. 
“This  consonant  furnished  me  with  the  word  b'l  (‘Ba‘al’),  which  repeats  in  all 
the  lines  of  [Tablet]  No.  14,”  he  wrote  on  August  15,  1930.  “Unhappily,  in 
striking  out  from  the  consonant  b,  I read  bn,  ‘son,’  where  it  was  necessary 
to  read  bt  {bath,  ‘daughter,’  or  bayt,  ‘house’),  and  vice  versa.  This  derailment 
on  two  letters  as  frequent  as  n and  t had  rendered  my  subsequent  efforts  vain 
so  that  I was  only  put  back  on  the  track  by  an  article  which  Professor  [W.  F.] 
Albright  procured  for  me  in  the  middle  of  June . . . . M.  Hans  Bauer,  pro- 
fessor at  the  University  of  Halle,  announced  in  it  that  he  had  discovered  the 

key  of  the  Ras  Shamra  texts I did  not  have  Bauer’s  alphabet  before  me, 

but  the  elements  contained  in  the  above-mentioned  article  permitted  me  to 
believe  that  it  corresponds,  outside  of  a sign  or  two  perhaps,  to  that  which 
I composed  according  to  the  information  from  that  article  and  my  personal 
researches.” 

Virolleaud,  meanwhile,  had  solved  the  tablets  on  his  own.  He  had  looked 
for  a three-letter  word  with  his  / in  the  middle  as  a possible  mlk.  He  found  it, 
then  Ba'al,  then  an  itemized  list  that  gave  him  the  spelled-out  forms  of 
numbers,  which  virtually  completed  the  alphabet.  He  was  about  to  publish 
his  decipherment  when  Bauer  beat  him  to  it.  Like  Dhorme,  Virolleaud  did  not 
agree  with  all  of  Bauer’s  values.  Bauer  was  corresponding  with  Dhorme  and, 
on  comparing  his  work  with  the  Frenchman’s,  he  soon  found  that  a scribe’s 
dropping  of  a word  separator  had  led  him  astray.  His  primary  findings  of  k 
and  m,  as  well  as  p,  q,  s,  and  s,  had  been  wrong.  He  freely  admitted  this  “with 
a perfect  scientific  loyalty”  in  a letter  of  October  3 to  Dhorme.  His  other 
identifications  had  been  sufficiently  right  to  give  them  the  clues  they  needed 
to  decipher  the  texts,  however.  The  three  men  thus  solved,  partly  indepen-

dently,  partly  together,  the  alphabet  for  what  has  been  called  “the  most 
important  corpus  of  ancient  literature  discovered  so  far  in  the  twentieth  cen- 
tury.” 

For  dozens,  even  scores,  of  parallels  have  been  observed  between  Ugaritic 
literature  and  the  Bible.  One  Ugaritic  tablet  declares:  “Ah,  thy  enemies,  O 
Ba‘al;  ah,  thy  enemies,  you  will  strike  them  down;  Thus  you  will  slaughter 
your  adversaries.”  Psalm  92  proclaims:  “For,  lo,  Thine  enemies,  O Lord,  For, 
lo,  Thine  enemies  shall  perish;  All  the  workers  of  iniquity  shall  be  scattered.” 
Another  tablet  refers  to  “The  dew  of  heaven,  the  fat  of  the  earth,”  which  is 
almost  word  for  word  Genesis  27:28’s  “The  dew  of  heaven,  the  fatness  of  the 
earth.”  A third  says,  “Thy  kingdom  is  everlasting,  thy  power  (endureth)  to 
all  generations,”  which  is  not  unlike  Psalm  145:  “Thy  kingdom  is  an  ever- 
lasting kingdom,  and  thy  dominion  endureth  throughout  all  generations.” 
Even  Job’s  moving  expression  of  faith,  “But  as  for  me,  I know  that  my  Redeem- 
er liveth”  (19:25),  which  Handel  set  to  music  in  his  Messiah,  may  echo  a 
Ugaritic  tablet:  “I  know  that  Alein-Ba‘al  is  living.” 

The  parallels  can  illuminate  many  obscure  or  unique  words  in  the  Bible. 
They  can  help  explain  strange  practices.  The  reason  for  the  prohibition  of 
Exodus  23:19,  “Thou  shalt  not  seethe  a kid  in  its  mother’s  milk,”  the  basis  of 
the  kosher  law  that  forbids  mixing  meat  and  dairy  foods,  had  never  been  clear. 
A Ugarit  tablet  reading  in  part  “Cook  a lamb  in  milk,  a lamb  in  curdled 
milk”  suggests  that  the  Hebrews  reacted  against  a Canaanite  practice  and 
thereby  set  themselves  apart.  The  name  El,  which  Bauer  found  applied  to  a 
Ugarit  god  in  his  very  first  solution,  is  the  very  name  given  to  the  Hebrew  God 
Yahweh  in  Genesis  (often  in  the  plural  of  majesty,  Elohim).  Indeed,  a possible 
god  Yw  appears  in  the  Ugarit  tablets,  and  Ba’al  himself,  as  a son  of  god,  is  put 
to  death  and  rises  again.  It  well  may  be  that  the  literature  made  available  by 
the  three-man  decipherment  of  Ugaritic  will  illuminate  much  of  the  Holy 
Scriptures  of  the  Judaeo-Christian  ethos. 

Case  II  solutions — in  which  the  script  is  known  but  the  language  is  not — 
are  really  not  decipherments.  They  are  linguistic  reconstructions.  Many  have 
been  made,  particularly  during  the  explosive  growth  of  linguistic  science 
during  the  nineteenth  century. 

Gothic,  the  oldest  known  form  of  the  Germanic  languages  (of  which  En- 
glish is  a member),  had  become  extinct  by  about  the  900s;  it  survived  only  in 
such  Latin  alphabet  manuscripts  as  the  magnificent  Codex  Argentius,  a trans- 
lation of  the  four  Gospels.  A host  of  German  scholars  determined  its  gram- 
mar, the  meaning  of  its  words,  how  they  sounded— and  in  doing  so  shed  light 
on  the  development  of  modern  languages.  Ancient  Persian,  the  2,000-year-old 
language  of  the  Zend-Avesta,  was  reconstructed  by  the  successive  efforts  of 
Anquetil  du  Perron,  Rasmus  Rask,  Eugene  Bournouf,  Niels  Ludvig  Wester- 
gaard,  and  A.  V.  Williams  Jackson.  The  original  form  of  Slavic,  called  Old 
Slavic,  necessary  for  a knowledge  of  the  interrelationships  of  such  modern 


Ancestral  Voices 


901 


tongues  as  Russian,  Bulgarian,  Polish,  Czech,  Serbian,  and  Slovakian,  was 
found  only  in  scattered  church  manuscripts.  Philologists  such  as  Joseph 
Dobrovsky,  Franz  von  Miklosic,  and  August  Leskien  painstakingly  assembled 
a picture  of  the  dead  language  from  these  bits  and  pieces. 

Perhaps  the  most  interesting  Case  II  involved  Tokharian.  Expeditions  sent 
out  by  scholarly  societies  in  the  1890s  discovered  in  the  ruined  towns  of 
Eastern  Turkestan — the  westernmost  part  of  China — bundles  of  manuscripts 
almost  perfectly  preserved  by  the  bone-dry  climate  and  the  overlying  sands. 
One  group  proved  to  be  written  in  the  Brahmi  script,  used  in  ancient  India  and 
the  script  from  which  all  later  Indie  scripts  are  descended.  The  language,  how- 
ever, was  unknown.  Careful  analysis  of  the  manuscripts  by  F.  W.  K.  Muller 
showed  that  they  were  written  in  what  turned  out  to  be  two  new  members  of 
the  great  Indo-European  family  of  languages.  He  named  them  Tokharian  A 
and  B.  Surprisingly,  though  they  were  two  of  the  most  easterly  members  of 
that  family,  they  resembled  the  western  branch  more.  This  threw  new  light 
on  the  prehistoric  migrations  of  Central  Asia. 

In  such  reconstructions,  philologists  make  use  of  translations  (usually  in 
the  form  of  bilingual  inscriptions),  of  glosses  (marginal  notes  in  manuscripts 
explaining  the  meaning  of  some  obscure  or  foreign  word),  of  remarks  in 
other  literatures  about  the  meaning  of  alien  terms.  Philologists  have  also 
learned  enough  about  how  languages  develop  internally  to  identify  several 
normal  types  of  linguistic  change.  The  pair  “man,  men”  is  an  example  of  one 
such  regular  variation,  known  as  umlaut.  This  alters  one  vowel  to  another 
under  the  influence  of  a succeeding  sound.  In  the  Primitive  Germanic,  the 
plural  of  man  was  “manni” ; speakers,  anticipating  the  front-of-the-mouth  /ee/ 
sound  of  the  plural,  shifted  the  /a/  forward  in  the  mouth  to  become  the  /eh/ 
sound,  and  this  remained  when  the  final  syllable  fell  away.  Other  types  of 
change,  such  as  assimilation,  dissimilation,  diphthongization,  and  articula- 
tive  intrusion,  enable  the  philologist  to  trace  sounds  back  like  a movie  run  in 
reverse  and  so  to  arrive  at  an  earlier  point  in  the  development  of  the  language. 
These  principles  also  assist  in  determining  differences  between  languages 
descended  from  a common  ancestor,  so  that  the  vocabulary  and  syntax  of  a 
known  tongue  can  be  applied  on  a basis  of  analogy  to  help  determine  those  of 
the  unknown  one. 

These  processes  commingle  with  those  of  Case  I in  Case  III  decipherments. 
Incomparably  the  most  romantic  instance  is  that  of  the  Egyptian  hieroglyphs. 

Probably  the  most  beautiful  system  of  writing  ever  created,  hieroglyphics 
burst  suddenly  into  being  just  before  the  unification  of  Upper  and  Lower 
Egypt  into  one  kingdom  about  3200  b.c.  They  appeared  first  in  rudimentary 
form  on  small  seals  and  decorative  palettes  and  developed  rapidly.  By  the 
Fourth  Dynasty,  artists  were  painting  columns  of  hieroglyphs  on  the  chamber 
walls  of  the  immense  pyramids,  all  around  the  reddish  men  with  the  strange 
eyes  and  contorted  bodies  who  march  and  hunt  and  sail  eternally — comrades

for  the  departed  kings.  Pharaohs  with  names  like  Amenhotep  and  Thutmose 
and  Ramses  carved  monumental  inscriptions  in  it  on  the  massive  temples  of 
Karnak  and  Luxor.  The  writing  itself  comprises  lovely  drawings  of  birds, 
snakes,  squares,  feathers,  shepherd’s  crooks,  whorls,  stools,  hands,  banners, 
and  hundreds  of  other  images. 

Egypt  held  many  mysteries  for  the  foreigner.  No  one  knew  the  source  of 
the  Nile,  nor  why  it  annually  spread  its  gift  of  fertile  soil  upon  the  land.  The 
Greeks  puzzled  over  this  old  civilization,  indisputably  developed  indepen- 
dently of  their  own,  so  at  variance  with  their  opinion  of  barbaric  foreigners, 
so  wounding  to  their  own  confident  superiority.  The  abyss  between  the 
Oriental  and  Occidental  world-views — the  one  mystical,  the  other  rational — 
prevented  total  comprehension,  and  the  Greeks  sensed  that  something  was  not 
coming  through  in  their  intercourse  with  the  Egyptians.  They  thought  that  a 
mysterious  knowledge  lurked  behind  this  impenetrable  veil.  They  came  to 
regard  Egypt  as  the  fount  of  an  ineffable  wisdom  of  the  East.. Their  admira- 
tion for  what  Pythagoras  called  “the  symbolic  and  occult  teachings”  of  Egypt 
distorted  their  preconceptions  of  the  hieroglyphics. 

For  the  Greeks  never  really  learned  the  complex  writing  system.  The 
meanings  of  a few  hieroglyphs  were  explained  to  them,  but  they  never  grasped 
the  relation  between  the  sound  and  the  image.  Rather  they  misinterpreted  this 
relation  as  an  allegorical  one.  Thus,  one  writer  knew  that  the  Egyptians  used 
the  picture  of  a goose  to  represent  the  Egyptian  word  for  “son,"  but  he 
thought  that  they  did  so  because  this  animal  supposedly  loved  its  offspring 
more  than  any  other.  This  false  view  of  hieroglyphics  perfectly  fitted  the 
Platonic  theory  of  forms,  in  which  the  concrete  objects  of  the  real  express  the 
abstract  notions  of  the  ideal.  Plato’s  congeniality  to  Christianity  fixed  this 
impression  strongly  in  men’s  minds  and  long  prevented  proper  understanding. 
A neoplatonist  philosopher,  Plotinus,  himself  born  in  Egypt,  gave  the  idea  of 
hieroglyphics  the  formulation  that  became  universally  accepted:  the  Egyp- 
tians, in  their  superior  wisdom,  had  imbued  these  pictures — which  trans- 
cended ordinary  writing — with  symbolic  qualities  that  intuitively  revealed  to 
the  initiated  a vision  of  the  very  essence  of  things.  Plotinus  drew  part  of  this 
conception  from  the  Egyptians  themselves,  who  regarded  writing  as  possessing 
magical  powers.  His  view  endowed  the  hieroglyphics  with  the  fascinating 
aura  of  esoterism  and  hidden  knowledge  and  eternal  truth  that  surrounds 
them  to  this  day. 

In  ancient  Egypt,  hieroglyphics  transmitted  the  solemn  proclamations  of 
the  divine  king  and  his  priestly  viziers  to  the  gods  and  to  his  subjects;  the 
word  “hieroglyph”  itself  means  “sacred  carvings.”  But  the  domination  of 
foreigners,  beginning  with  the  Persian  conquest  of  525  b.c.  and  continuing 
with  the  Greeks  under  Alexander,  cut  the  script  off  from  its  political  roots. 
The  writing  became  a professional  secret  of  the  priests.  The  people  began  to 
write  their  language  in  the  Greek  alphabet  of  the  rulers.  The  hieroglyphic 
vocabulary  contracted.  Inscriptions  grew  increasingly  stereotyped.  With  the 


Ancestral  Voices 


903 


advent  of  Christianity  and  the  collapse  of  the  pagan  religion,  the  hieroglyphic 
tradition  flickered  out  here  and  there  over  Egypt.  It  resisted  longest  on  the 
Island  of  Philae  near  the  First  Cataract  of  the  Nile,  where  a fanatic  Nubian 
clergy  defended  the  cult  of  Isis  in  dilapidated  temples  amid  memories  of  past 
glories.  Here  the  last  hieroglyphic  inscription  was  recorded  in  394  a.d.  The 
last  man  to  know  the  ancient  writing  as  a living  tradition  must  have  gone  to 
his  grave  soon  thereafter.  So  the  gods  departed  from  Egypt.  Isis  and  Osiris,  Ra 
and  Thoth  fell  silent  for  more  than  a thousand  years. 

But  their  memory  lingered.  The  Pyramids  stood.  The  Sphinx  brooded. 
The  shadowy  notion  of  Egypt’s  omniscience  haunted  Europe,  and  the  currents 
that  stirred  the  Renaissance  quickened  the  never-quite-forgotten  curiosity 
about  the  hieroglyphs.  Leon  Battista  Alberti  attempted  to  reconstruct  them 
from  written  descriptions,  and  urged  their  use  as  imperishable  inscriptions  on 
monuments.  The  great  Hypnerotomachia  Poliphili,  printed  by  Aldus  Manutius 
in  Venice  in  1499,  scattered  hieroglyphic  emblems  throughout  its  exquisite 
woodcuts.  Much  of  this  activity  stemmed  from  the  discovery  in  1419  of  the 
only  manuscript  on  the  subject  preserved  from  antiquity,  the  Hieroglyphics 
of  a fourth-century  author  known  only  as  Horapollo,  which  was  immedi- 
ately accepted  as  the  accurate  authority  on  the  subject  and  which  fixed  the 
course  of  investigation  for  centuries.  Circulating  at  first  in  manuscript,  it  was 
published  by  Aldus  Manutius  in  1505.  Horapollo  knew  what  some  of  the 
signs  meant,  probably  because  Egyptians  had  told  him.  But  his  derivations 
of  sense  from  symbol  are  totally  wrong,  and  so  he  could  not  interpret  the 
inscriptions.  His  ideas  in  general  followed  those  of  Plotinus,  who  had  written 
in  the  third  century.  He  therefore  assumed  that  the  hieroglyph  of  a bird  stood 
for  that  particular  bird  or  for  some  idea  associated  with  it,  as  speed  or  flight. 
He  supposed  that  the  vulture  was  used  for  “mother”  (as  it  was)  because  no 
male  vultures  exist! 

This  allegorical  interpretation  of  Horapollo  contaminated  the  many  other 
attempts  to  comprehend  the  meaning  of  hieroglyphics  that  followed  his.  One 
such  became  the  first  “modern”  authority  on  the  subject.  Its  author  was 
Pierius  Valerianus,  a famous  scholar  whose  secular  name  was  Giovan  Pietro 
della  Fosse  and  who  tutored  the  future  Pope  Leo  X and  later  became  his 
private  secretary.  Hieroglyphic  problems  fascinated  him,  and  at  various 
times  during  his  life  he  wrote  the  58  books  of  what  was  published  in  1556  as 
his  Hieroglyphica,  a remarkably  unified  and  elegant  work.  Each  book  deals 
with  the  symbolic  significance  of  one  or  more  hieroglyphs  in  explanations 
drawn  from  Horapollo  and  other  classics  dealing  with  the  subject.  The 
elephant  symbolizes  purity  because  it  bathes  in  rivers  at  full  moon.  Alone,  the 
lion  stands  for  “nobleness  of  mind,”  yoked  with  a wild  boar,  for  “strength  of 
mind  and  body,”  roaring,  for  “bestial  ferocity,”  and  with  a cock,  for  “pious 
timidity”  because  of  its  supposed  awe  of  the  fowl.  The  work  was  reprinted  at 
least  eleven  times  and  translated  thrice. 

Through  the  history  of  those  years  runs  the  continuous  thread  of  interest 


904 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


in  the  problem,  visible  in  comments  in  books  widely  scattered  in  time  and 
space.  While  many  authors  attempted  to  draw  out  of  the  hieroglyphs  the  pro- 
found wisdom  that  they  supposedly  enclosed,  none  seriously  attempted  a new 
decipherment  until  the  17th  century.  By  then  the  first  extensive  collection  of 
authentic  hieroglyphic  inscriptions,  J.  F.  Herwath  von  Hohenburg’s  Thesaurus 
Hieroglyphicorum,  had  been  published. 

The  most  ambitious  attack  on  the  meaning  of  the  Egyptian  writings  was 
mounted  by  the  Jesuit  Athanasius  Kircher,  who  later  in  his  life  was  to  fail  to 
read  the  mysterious  manuscript  attributed  to  Roger  Bacon.  Kircher  was  the 
most  famous  and  prolific  scholar  of  his  time,  author  of  a book  on  cryptology 
and  universal  language,  and  for  several  years  a professor  of  mathematics.  If 
Leibnitz  was  the  last  man  to  know  everything,  Kircher  may  have  been  the 
next  to  last.  His  lifework  sought  to  combine  the  totality  of  knowledge  into  a 
universal  cosmology,  in  which  divine  truth  moved  the  universe.  Christianity 
manifested  this  truth  perfectly,  but  Kircher  found  its  highest  pre-Christian 
form  in  the  Egyptian  philosophical  and  magical  treatises  attributed  to  Hermes 
Trismegistus.  Kircher  believed  that  Hermes  Trismegistus  was  a real  Egyptian 
priest  who  had  lived  in  remotest  antiquity,  but  the  treatises  had  actually  been 
written  by  early  Christians  and  so,  despite  their  pagan  and  gnostic  elements, 
were  theologically  consistent  with  Christianity.  Kircher  was  certain  that  he 
knew  in  general  what  the  hieroglyphic  texts  contained:  the  esoteric  knowledge 
of  ultimate  reality  said  by  Plotinus  to  have  been  possessed  by  the  Egyptians. 
His  hope  of  confirming  this  by  reading  the  texts  and  thereby  proving  the  truth 
of  his  cosmology  motivated  his  prodigious  efforts  to  decipher  them. 

In  1636  appeared  his  Prodromus  coptus  sive  cegypticus,  which  put  forth 
the  original  view  that  Coptic— the  language  of  Egypt  that  Arabic  had  dis- 
placed but  that  was  still  used,  written  in  Greek  characters,  in  the  liturgy  of 
the  Coptic,  or  Egyptian  Christian,  church— “was  formerly  the  Pharaonic 
language.”  In  other  words,  Coptic  was  the  latest  form  of  the  same  Egyptian 
language  that  had  been  written  in  hieroglyphs.  In  this,  and  in  his  further 
statement  that  a knowledge  of  Coptic  would  be  needed  for  a solution  of 
hieroglyphics,  Kircher  was  absolutely  correct.  His  Lingua  cegyptiaca  restituta 
of  1644  laid  the  foundation  for  Coptic  studies.  But  then  his  great  work  on  the 
interpretation  of  hieroglyphs  ignored  his  own  advice.  The  CEdipus  agyptiacus 
of  1652-1655  identified  each  hieroglyph  with  a philosophical  concept  in  the 
old  allegorical  way  and  so  was  able  to  make  them  reflect  Kircher’s  cosmology. 
Kircher  read  a group  that  stood  for  nothing  more  than  the  name  of  the 
pharaoh  Apries  as  “The  benefits  of  the  divine  Osiris  are  to  be  procured  by 
means  of  sacred  ceremonies  and  of  the  chain  of  the  Genii,  in  order  that  the 
benefits  of  the  Nile  may  be  obtained.”  Another  of  his  hieroglyphic  works,  the 
Sphinx  mystagogica,  interpreted  the  simple  phrase  “Osiris  says”  as  “The  life 
of  things,  after  the  defeat  of  Tryphon,  the  moisture  of  Nature,  through  the 
vigilance  of  Anubis.”  Kircher  made  a few  lucky  guesses,  such  as  that  three 
wavy  lines  stood  for  both  “water”  and  the  sound  /m/  because  the  Coptic 


Ancestral  Voices 


905 


word  for  water  was  “mu.”  But  these  few  grains  of  truth  were  submerged  in  a 
sea  of  nonsense.  This  quickly  became  evident  to  other  scholars,  particularly 
in  the  critical  Age  of  Reason  that  followed. 

The  collapse  of  Kircher’s  ambitious  attempt  quelled  any  further  major 
trials  at  solution  for  a century  and  a half.  Interest  nevertheless  remained  high, 
fed  in  part  by  the  inscriptions  that  continually  came  to  light.  The  Great  Seal 
of  the  United  States,  designed  in  1790,  depicts  an  Egyptian  pyramid  capped 
by  an  eye,  the  supposed  hieroglyphic  symbol  of  divine  justice ; this  can  be  seen 
on  the  back  of  every  U.S.  dollar  bill.  Mozart  set  The  Magic  Flute  in  and  around 
the  Temple  of  Isis  and  Osiris  and  peopled  it  with  the  high  priest  and  an 
Egyptian  prince.  The  opera  was  produced  in  1791,  when  the  West  had  gotten 
no  further  in  the  reading  of  hieroglyphics  than  it  had  a thousand  years  before. 
Indeed,  in  1797,  Georg  Zoega,  in  his  enormous  700-page  resume  of  Egypto- 
logical matter,  declared  the  problem  insoluble.  Two  years  later,  an  Egyptian 
laborer  named  Dhautpoul  was  building  a fort  for  the  French  conquerors  of 
his  native  land  near  a town  in  the  Nile  Delta  whose  native  name  was  Rashid. 
His  eye  was  caught  by  an  irregular  slab  of  fine-grained  black  basalt,  either 
lying  on  the  ground,  as  some  accounts  say,  or  built  into  an  old  wall  which  he 
was  demolishing.  It  was  covered  with  three  bands  of  writing — hieroglyphs, 
something  thought  to  be  Syriac,  and  Greek.  Pierre-Fran?ois  Bouchard,  an 
alert  French  officer  of  engineers  in  charge  of  the  gang,  thought  that  they  were 
probably  three  versions  of  the  same  text  and  that  the  Greek  might  serve  as 
a key  to  solving  the  mystery  of  hieroglyphics.  He  knew  of  the  large  group 
of  scientists  that  Napoleon  had  taken  with  him  on  his  Egyptian  expedition 
to  study  the  antiquities,  and  he  sent  the  stone  to  his  commander,  reporting 
that  it  had  been  found  near  a town  known  to  Europeans  as  Rosetta. 

The  stone’s  importance  was  instantly  recognized.  In  Cairo,  copies  were 
made  of  it.  When  the  French  surrendered  to  the  British  in  Egypt  in  the  spring 
of  1801,  Article  XVI  of  the  Treaty  of  Capitulation  gave  the  Rosetta  Stone  to 
the  British.  It  eventually  reached  the  British  Museum,  where  it  reposes  today 
at  the  south  end  of  the  Egyptian  Sculpture  Gallery,  probably  the  most  famous 
single  archeological  discovery  in  history.  It  measures  3 feet  9 inches  high,  2 
feet  4 inches  wide,  and  1 1 inches  thick.  Both  upper  corners  and  the  lower  right 
corner  are  broken  off.  The  Greek  text  consists  of  54  lines;  of  the  hieroglyphic 
there  remain  only  14,  corresponding  to  the  last  28  of  the  Greek,  all  but  two  of 
which  are  missing  part  of  the  ends.  The  central  band  proved  to  be  in  a writing 
called  demotic,  “the  language  of  the  people,”  a simplified  form  of  script  used 
in  business.  Demotic  had  evolved  out  of  hieratic,  itself  a simplified  form  of 
hieroglyphics  that  had  developed  for  writing  on  papyrus.  At  times  in  Egyptian 
history  all  three  existed  side  by  side,  employing  essentially  the  same  principle 
of  expressing  sound  in  script,  though  the  forms  differed  greatly. 

Several  translations  were  made  of  the  Greek  text.  It  was  dated  on  the 
fourth  day  of  the  Greek  month  Xandikos  (April)  of  the  ninth  year  of  the 
reign  of  Ptolemy  V Epiphanes,  which  would  be  196  b.c.  A convocation  of

Egyptian  priests  set  forth  the  benefits  which  this  pharaoh  had  conferred  upon 
them  and  upon  Egypt — gifts  of  money  and  corn  to  the  temples,  remission  of 
taxes,  conquest  of  the  town  of  Shekan,  and  so  forth.  In  return,  they  honored 
him  by  making  his  birthday  a festival  day  forever,  erecting  golden  statues  of 
him  in  every  temple  of  Egypt,  and  cutting  Egyptian  and  Greek  copies  of  this 
decree  upon  slabs  of  basalt  in  the  three  writings  and  placing  them  in  the 
temples  next  to  the  statues.  This  last  point  confirmed  the  probability  that  the 
three  texts  were  three  versions  of  the  same  text  and  permitted  scholars  to 
compare  them  with  assurance. 

Yet  the  mere  existence  of  the  Rosetta  Stone  did  not  make  solution  auto- 
matic. The  most  eminent  Orientalist  of  the  day,  Sylvestre  de  Sacy,  professor  of 
Arabic  in  Paris,  very  sensibly  tried  to  locate  the  proper  names  of  the  Greek 
text  in  the  demotic,  beginning  with  this  because  he  felt  it  to  be  alphabetic.  The 
hieroglyphic  script  frightened  people  off  because  many  still  regarded  it  as  a 
secret  symbolology  and  because  it  was  so  badly  damaged.  He  found  the 
approximate  groups  for  “Ptolemy”  and  “Alexander,”  but  the  15  letter-values 
that  he  obtained  would  not  yield  Coptic-like  words  elsewhere  in  the  text.  He 
frankly  admitted  his  failure  and  handed  over  his  material  to  the  Swedish 
diplomat  and  scholar,  Johan  David  Akerblad.  A talented  linguist  and  student 
of  Coptic,  Akerblad  managed  to  solve  in  two  months  many  of  the  problems 
that  had  baffled  de  Sacy.  Using  the  same  general  approach,  he  established  a 
demotic  alphabet  of  29  letters,  half  of  which  were  correct,  and  educed  words 
that  were  more  or  less  identical  to  the  Coptic,  thus  proving  that  the  language 
of  the  ancient  Egyptians  was  indeed  related  to  Coptic.  But  his  insistence  that 
demotic  was  entirely  alphabetic  blocked  further  progress. 

He  did  not  touch  the  hieroglyphs.  The  few  who  did  treated  them  as  alle- 
gorically as  had  Kircher,  with  results  about  as  valuable.  One  case,  in  fact,  was 
more  extreme  than  anything  that  had  gone  before.  Another  Swedish  diplomat, 
Count  N.  G.  Palin,  thought  that  the  Psalms  of  David  were  Hebrew  transla- 
tions of  Egyptian  texts.  If,  he  suggested,  the  Hebrew  were  to  be  translated  into 
Chinese,  the  Chinese  would  provide  a key  to  the  decipherment  of  the  hiero- 
glyphs! 

In  1814,  the  Rosetta  Stone  came  to  the  attention  of  Thomas  Young.  A 
British  physician,  then  41,  whose  hobby  was  science,  he  revived  the  wave 
theory  of  light  on  the  basis  of  his  discovery  of  the  principle  of  interference, 
advanced  the  theory  that  the  eye  sees  color  by  fibers  that  respond  to  red, 
green,  and  violet  light,  described  the  visual  defect  of  astigmatism,  contributed 
to  the  theory  of  tides,  defined  a coefficient  of  elasticity  (Young’s  modulus),  and 
investigated  epicycloidal  curves,  spiders,  the  atmosphere  of  the  moon, 
capillarity,  and  diseases  of  the  chest.  He  knew  modern  languages,  including 
Arabic,  Ethiopic,  and  Turkish,  and  some  ancient  ones,  such  as  Hebrew, 
Persian,  and  Coptic.  With  their  help,  he  made  some  progress  with  the  demotic 
inscription  and  then  turned  to  the  hieroglyphic. 

He  first  assumed  that  the  hieroglyphs  enclosed  in  ovals  with  a straight  line 


Ancestral  Voices

at  one  end,  called  cartouches,  represented  the  names  of  royalty.  His  com- 
parisons of  the  demotic,  hieratic,  and  hieroglyphic  scripts  convinced  him  that 
the  first  had  been  derived  from  the  second,  and  that  hieratic  had  come  from 
hieroglyphic.  The  signs  of  the  demotic  seemed  to  be  letters  that  stood  for 
sounds;  could  the  signs  of  the  older  script  be  just  more  elaborate  versions  of 
those  letters?  If  this  were  so,  scribes  in  a conquered  country  like  Egypt 
might  well  resort  to  them  to  spell  out  the  names  of  foreigners,  which  might 
not  be  otherwise  reproducible  in  the  native  script.  He  might  test  this  hypo- 
thesis by  seeing  if  the  writing  in  the  cartouches  yielded  the  name  that  he  knew 
from  the  Greek  version,  “Ptolemy.” 

The  five  cartouches  contained  only  two  sets  of  hieroglyphics.  The  eight 
signs  of  the  shorter  appeared  as  the  first  eight  signs  of  the  longer,  which  had 
16  signs.  Young  had  seen  that  in  the  Greek  text  the  longer  form  of  Ptolemy 
included  titles.  He  concentrated  on  the  simpler  short  version,  and  equated  its 
eight  signs  with  the  ten  letters  of  the  Greek  form  “Ptolemaios”  by  agglomerat- 
ing the  Greek  letters  into  six  rather  arbitrary  syllables  ( p , t,  ole,  ma,  i,  os),  by 
counting  a doubled  sign  (two  feathers  side  by  side)  as  a single  letter,  and  by 
regarding  another  sign  (a  loop)  as  a kind  of  silent  letter.  This  gave  him  the 
Egyptian  equivalents  for  the  six  sounds.  He  inserted  these  equivalents  into  a 
similar  cartouche  from  the  ceiling  of  a temple  at  Karnak,  and,  by  filling  in 
known  sound-values  and  guessing  at  new  ones,  identified  the  name  of 
the  pharaoh  Ptolemy  1 Soter.  He  did  the  same  for  that  of  the  queen, 
Berenice. 

Here  he  stopped.  Though  he  had  managed  to  read  six  signs  correctly  out 
of  the  13  that  he  had  identified  and  three  partly  correctly,  he  declared  that  he 
had  been  unable  to  find  any  cases  in  which  the  alphabetical  signs  were  used 
for  native  words  or  names  and  that  it  was  therefore  idle  to  try  reading  the  pure 
hieroglyphic  with  them.  Actually,  his  correct  identifications  had  produced 
such  names  as  “Ptah,”  which  occurred  in  his  own  vocabulary.  But  he  evidently 
did  not  recognize  them  and  he  quit  the  field,  having  made  the  crucial  break- 
through of  recognizing  the  presence  of  alphabetic  elements  in  a script  for- 
merly thought  to  be  purely  logographic  and  symbolic. 

The  attack  was  pressed  by  a young  man  of  sallow  complexion  and  burning 
genius,  a prodigy  whose  lifelong  passion  had  been  to  disclose  the  mystery  of 
the  hieroglyphs.  Jean-Frangois  Champollion  was  born  in  Lot,  France,  on 
December  23,  1790;  five  years  later  he  achieved  his  first  decipherment  by 
teaching  himself  to  read.  The  seeds  of  his  destiny  were  sown  when  he  was  10 
and  the  mathematician  Jean-Baptiste  Fourier,  then  at  Grenoble  where  Jean- 
Frangois  was  studying,  showed  the  boy  his  collection  of  Egyptian  antiquities. 
The  youngster  announced  that  when  he  was  big  he  would  read  the  writing  on 
them.  His  life  from  then  consisted  of  one  long  preparation  for  his  accomplish- 
ment. At  17,  he  read  a paper  on  “Egypt  Under  the  Pharaohs”  to  the  staff  of 
the  Grenoble  high  school;  they  were  so  impressed  they  elected  the  youth  to 
the  faculty  on  the  spot.  Continuing  his  studies  in  Paris,  he  learned  Sanskrit, 


908 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Arabic,  Persian,  Hebrew,  and,  above  all,  Coptic.  He  had  determined  not  to 
tackle  the  difficult  problem  until  he  had  thoroughly  prepared  himself. 

He  made  intensive  comparisons  of  the  three  kinds  of  writing,  though  at  first 
he  thought  that  the  more  recent  demotic  was  the  older.  He  clung  to  the  con- 
ventional symbolistic  view  of  the  hieroglyphs.  But  he  was  able  to  confirm  an 
ingenious  observation  of  Akerblad,  based  on  the  Coptic,  that  a horned  viper 
represented  /f/,  which  meant  “he”  at  the  end  of  certain  words.  Champollion 
extended  this  to  some  other  end-letters  that  stood  for  other  personal  pro- 
nouns. About  1819,  however,  personal  and  political  troubles  so  depressed  him 
that  he  began  to  doubt  even  his  best  results.  He  reverted  to  such  fantasies  as 
thinking  that  the  lion  crouched  in  the  middle  of  Ptolemy’s  cartouche  represen- 
ted his  name  as  a symbol  of  war,  which  in  Greek  was  “polemos,”  the  word 
from  which  came  Ptolemy’s  name  (which  means  “mighty  in  war”). 

To  discipline  himself,  he  undertook  a meticulous  comparison  of  the  signs 
of  all  known  Egyptian  texts.  This  corrected  his  chronology  of  the  three  scripts 
and  enabled  him  to  trace  a sign  from  hieroglyphic  through  hieratic  to  demotic. 
In  December,  1821,  his  counts  showed  that  the  hieroglyphic  text  of  the  Rosetta 
Stone  contained  1,419  signs  whereas  the  Greek  text  consisted  of  only  486 
words.  This  made  untenable  the  old  theory  that  each  sign  represented  a whole 
word ; he  therefore  decided  to  test  once  and  for  all  the  theory  that  at  least 
some  of  these  hieroglyphs  represented  sounds.  He  transcribed  the  name 
“Ptolemy,”  which  on  linguistic  grounds  he  now  spelled  Ptolemis,  from  the 
demotic  version  (known  from  the  Rosetta  Stone,  and  thought  to  be  alphabetic) 
to  hieratic  to  hieroglyphic.  He  arrived  at  a spelling  that  was  virtually  identical 
with  the  hieroglyphs  of  the  Rosetta  Stone.  This  proved  that  the  hieroglyphs 
represented  sounds,  and  buried  the  theory  that  each  hieroglyph  was  purely  the 
symbolic  expression  of  an  idea. 

A month  later,  a friend  sent  him  a new  lithograph  of  a bilingual  inscrip- 
tion from  a granite  obelisk  found  at  Philae  in  1815.  The  Greek  text  showed 
it  to  be  a priestly  appeal  to — interestingly  enough — the  children  of  the  Ptolemy 
eulogized  in  the  Rosetta  Stone;  their  names  were  Ptolemy  and  Cleopatra. 
Champollion  recognized  the  cartouche  of  this  Ptolemy  from  the  cartouche 
for  the  same  name  on  the  Rosetta  Stone.  And  he  observed  that  several  of  its 
hieroglyphs  reappeared  in  the  Cleopatra  cartouche  in  positions  that  showed 
that  the  signs  corresponded  to  sounds  that  the  two  names  had  in  common. 
Thus,  the  first  sign  of  Ptolemis,  a square,  was  the  fifth  of  Cleopatra,  proving 
it  to  be  Ip/.  The  third  sign  of  Ptolemis,  a noose,  was  the  fourth  of  Cleopatra, 
proving  it  to  be  /o/.  A lion  was  the  fourth  sign  of  Ptolemis  and  the  second  of 
Cleopatra,  proving  it  to  be  / 1 /.  And  the  vulture  that  stood  in  the  sixth  position 
of  Cleopatra  also  stood  in  the  ninth,  proving  it  to  be  /a/.  The  only  irregularity 
was  that  the  two  words  used  different  signs  for  their  /t/’s ; he  regarded  this  as  a 
case  of  homophony.  Like  Young,  he  considered  the  double  feather  in  Ptolemis 
to  be  a single  letter,  the  /i/. 

It  was  January,  1822.  Within  a few  feverish  months,  the  31-year-old 


Ancestral  Voices 


decipherer  turned  out  an  almost  complete  translation  of  the  hieroglyphic 
names  of  rulers  of  Egypt  from  Alexander  to  Antoninus  Pius.  He  derived  the 

sound-values  of  the  other  phonetic  hieroglyphs  by  the  cryptanalytic  method 

substituting  known  values,  guessing  at  the  names,  and  testing  the  presumed 


Champollion  s cross-checking  of  hieroglyphic  sound-values  in  royal  names 

values  elsewhere.  But  this  solution,  while  undoubtedly  correct,  might  have 
proved  of  only  secondary  importance  had  these  alphabetic  signs  served  only 
tor  foreign  names  and  played  no  part  in  spelling  out  the  native  Egyptian 
tongue.  Had  he  come  this  far  only  to  face  the  same  difficulty  that  Young  had  ? 

On  September  14,  1822,  he  received  some  inscriptions  from  the  colossal 
rock-hewn  temple  of  Abu  Simbel  on  the  Nile.  Unquestionably  it  antedated

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Graeco-Roman  times.  One  inscription  contained  a cartouche  with  four  signs: 
a circle  with  a dot  in  it,  which  represented  the  sun,  a three-pronged  sign  whose 
meaning  was  unknown  to  him,  and  two  occurrences  of  a sign  like  a shep- 
herd’s crook  that  he  knew  from  Ptolemis  stood  for  /s/.  Coptic  had  taught  him 
that  the  sun  was  called  “ra”  or  “re,”  and  the  three-pronged  sign  occurred  in 
a part  of  the  Rosetta  Stone  hieroglyphics  that  appeared  to  represent  the  com- 
plex of  Greek  words  meaning  “be  born”  or  “engender”  that  added  up  to 
“birthday.”  The  Coptic  for  this  was  “mise,”  and  the  four  symbols  could  thus 
stand  for  “Ra-mise-s-s.”  It  flashed  before  him  that  he  was  reading  the  hiero- 
glyphic form  of  one  of  the  most  famous  of  pharaonic  names,  “Ramses,”  and 
that  the  name  meant  something  like  “child  of  the  sun.”  At  the  same  moment 
his  eye  was  caught  by  another  cartouche,  containing  an  ibis,  known  as  a bird 
of  the  god  Thoth,  the  three-pronged  sign,  and  another  shepherd’s  crook  /s/, 
and  he  realized  in  a dazzling  instant  that  this  was  “Thutmose,”  another  well- 
known  pharaonic  name,  which  obviously  meant  “child  of  Thoth.” 

The  spell  was  broken.  The  problem  of  the  ages  had  been  solved.  In  a fever 
of  excitement  Champollion  rushed  to  his  brother’s  office  nearby,  threw  his 
papers  on  the  desk,  pronounced  his  famous  “Je  tiens  l'affaire !”  (“I’ve  got  it !”), 
and  collapsed. 

With  this  new  knowledge  of  the  writing  system  enabling  him  to  penetrate 
to  the  language,  and  his  knowledge  of  Coptic  enabling  him  to  approximate 
Egyptian,  Champollion  refined  and  corrected  the  language  by  the  script  and 
the  script  by  the  language.  Within  three  years  he  had  arrived  at  an  under- 
standing of  both  accurate  enough  to  enable  him  to  translate  an  Early  Egyptian 
inscription  of  Amenophis  III.  Ele  discovered  that  the  hieroglyphic  writing 
system  was  essentially  that  of  the  rebus,  though  overlaid  with  many  refine- 
ments. In  a rebus,  a word  is  represented  by  an  object  whose  spoken  name 
resembles  the  spoken  form  of  the  word.  In  English,  for  example,  the  verb 
“be”  might  be  represented  by  a picture  of  a bee;  a child’s  cry,  or  wail,  by  a 
picture  of  a whale.  The  Egyptians  drew  a swallow,  /wr/  in  Egyptian  (the 
vowels  of  the  language  are  unknown,  since  they  were  not  written  for  most  of 
its  history),  to  indicate  the  word  “great,”  which  is  /wr/,  a beetle  (/hpr/)  to 
indicate  /hpr/,  meaning  “to  become,”  and  so  forth.  The  goose  meant  “son” 
because  the  Egyptian  words  for  goose  and  son  sounded  alike,  as  did  the  pair 
“vulture”  and  “mother.” 

The  system  obviously  had  great  potential  for  confusion,  intensified  by  the 
lack  of  vowels;  to  preclude  as  much  of  it  as  possible  the  Egyptians  tacked 
onto  their  words  mute  explanatory  signs  called  determinatives.  Thus,  a picture 
of  a seated  man  always  followed  names  or  designations  of  men,  a pelt  with  a 
tail  followed  mentions  of  mammals,  a jug  was  used  for  citations  of  liquids,  a 
pair  of  legs  for  movement,  a circle  with  an  open  cross  inside  (representing  a 
walled  city  with  intersecting  streets)  for  towns,  a papyrus  roll  for  spiritual 
matters. 

Champollion  distinguished  these  from  the  true  logograms  that  Egyptians 


Ancestral  Voices 


911 


also  used.  Thus,  a picture  of  an  eye  meant  “eye,”  of  a bow  meant  “bow”;  a 
stylized  representation  of  a loaf  meant  “bread,”  of  an  angle  meant  “corner. 
The  Egyptians  further  used  logograms  to  stand  for  verbs  and  adverbs  by 
extending  their  images  to  associated  concepts.  A man  with  a stick  in  his  hand 
meant  “to  beat” ; a leg  and  foot,  “to  walk” ; a stooped  man  leaning  on  a staff, 
“old  age”;  a lily,  the  flower  characteristic  of  Upper  Egypt,  to  mean  “south.” 
There  were  hundreds  of  these  in  common  use.  They  had  in  part  inspired  the 
old  allegorical  view  of  hieroglyphs,  and  they  gave  it  the  only  validity  it  had 
had. 

Someone  reading  hieroglyphics  aloud  would  therefore  have  to  know 
whether  a given  sign  represented  a single  sound  that  formed  part  of  a word,  a 
concept  whose  spoken  form  would  not  have  anything  to  do  with  the  picture 
(as  the  sound  of  “lily”  in  Egyptian  has  nothing  to  do  with  that  of  “south”), 
or  a determinative  that  was  not  to  be  uttered  at  all.  Nor  did  that  end  the  com- 
plexity of  hieroglyphics.  Not  content  with  determinatives,  the  Egyptians  often 
added  extra  phonetic  signs  to  words,  to  make  absolutely  sure  the  sense  would 
come  through.  Though  the  swallow  adequately  represented  /wr/,  the  Egyp- 
tians liked  to  draw  a mouth,  standing  for  /r/,  after  the  swallow.  Though  “to 
hear”  was  effectively  expressed  by  the  picture  of  an  ear,  they  would  append  an 
owl,  standing  for  /m/,  the  last  sound  of  /sdm/  (“to  hear”)  just  after  the  ear. 
Often  it  seemed  as  if  they  could  not  pile  up  enough  of  these  pleonastic  symbols 
— to  the  decipherer,  however,  each  one  acted  as  a kind  of  null. 

The  final  complication  of  Egyptian  writing  were  the  homophones — 
different  signs  standing  for  the  same  sound.  In  Champollion’s  original 
decipherment,  a semicircle  stood  for  the  /t/  in  Ptolemis  and  a hand  for  the  /t/ 
in  Cleopatra.  Champollion  found  many  homophones:  so  many,  in  fact,  that 
they  retarded  general  acceptance  of  his  decipherment.  Eventually  the  German 
scientist  Richard  Lepsius  showed  that  many  of  these  phonetic  signs  stood  for 
two-  or  three-letter  consonantal  groups.  The  three-pronged  sign  that  had 
appeared  in  “Ramses”  and  “Thutmose”  stood,  not  just  for  /m/,  as  Champol- 
lion had  thought,  but  for  /ms/ — with  the  extra  /s/’s  that  Champollion  had 
found  in  those  words  just  pleonasm.  Lepsius’  decipherment  of  the  lengthy 
bilingual  Decree  of  Canopus,  discovered  in  1866,  cleared  up  many  of  the 
details  that  Champollion  had  not  been  able  to  resolve. 

For  he  had  died  in  1832,  aged  41,  less  than  ten  years  after  his  solution. 
Yet  he  had  had  the  satisfaction  of  having  resolved  the  riddle  which  the  silent 
Sphinx  had  guarded  since  time  immemorial.  Like  the  rising  sun  warming  the 
colossus  of  Memnon,  Champollion’s  brilliance  struck  sound  from  statues 
and  inscriptions  dumb  through  a long  darkness.  He  animated  a whole  vast 
civilization  once  known  only  through  its  relics.  The  decaying  temples,  the 
rock-hewn  tombs,  the  Pyramids,  became  the  setting  for  a shimmering  pageant 
of  barges  on  the  Nile,  of  slaves  and  nobles,  of  an  expedition  to  Punt  returning 
with  cinnamon-wood  and  apes  and  ivory,  of  strange  religious  beliefs  and 
incestuous  royalty  and  a brave  doomed  fight  for  monotheism,  of  the  young

warrior-pharaoh,  Ramses  II,  recording  upon  the  walls  of  Luxor  and  Thebes 
the  very  thoughts  he  thought  when  he  beat  back  an  enemy  army  that  almost 
overpowered  him  at  faraway  Kadesh — a drama  of  human  joys  and  sorrows 
reaching  back  into  unsuspected  depths  of  antiquity.  Champollion  let  man  see 
more  of  his  past  than  perhaps  any  other  human  being.  It  is  an  enviable 
accomplishment. 

It  is  not  only  the  dead  men  of  Egypt  who  have  told  their  tales.  Decipherers 
have  also  conjured  forth  the  annals  of  ancient  Babylonia.  Their  decipherment 
of  cuneiform  is  a more  astonishing  feat  in  a way  than  that  of  hieroglyphics 
because  it  was  achieved  without  the  aid  of  a bilingual.  Only  after  a simple 
cuneiform  used  for  a known  language  had  been  read  could  progress  be  made 
on  the  complicated  form  and  its  unknown  tongue — the  tongue  of  Nineveh  and 
Babylon. 

The  solution  was  begun  by  a 27-year-old  schoolteacher  of  Gottingen, 
Georg  Friedrich  Grotefend,  who  had  written  a book  on  a universal  language 
and  who  enjoyed  solving  ciphers  and  word  puzzles.  He  equated  a common  and 
repetitious  series  of  signs  in  the  cuneiform  inscriptions  with  the  frequent  and 
repetitious  formula  “king  of  kings”  and  “son  of  the  king  X”  that  was  known 
from  the  Greek  versions  of  later  Persian  inscriptions.  He  shrewdly  compared 
the  formulas  in  two  inscriptions  and  discerned  a succession  of  father,  son,  and 
grandson  in  which  the  son  and  grandson  were  kings  but  the  father  was  not. 
Historical  evidence  had  fixed  the  approximate  period  of  the  dynasty,  and  the 
kings  of  Persia  were  well  known  from  Greek  historians.  Grotefend  found  that 
only  Hystapes,  Darius,  and  Xerxes  fitted  the  pattern.  He  obtained  the 
modern  Persian  forms  of  the  names  from  the  Zend-Avesta,  substituted  these 
sound-values  back  into  the  cuneiform,  and  obtained  13  correct  values  and  four 
incorrect  ones  for  the  alphabet  of  42  signs.  This  was  the  breakthrough,  but 
much  of  the  subsequent  work  in  recovering  the  Old  Persian  language  was 
done  by  the  Danish  philologist  Rasmus  Rask. 

Independently,  an  Englishman,  Henry  C.  Rawlinson,  clinging  like  a fly  to 
the  sheer  face  of  the  high  cliff  of  Behistun  to  copy  the  trilingual  inscription 
carved  thereon  like  a giant  billboard  from  antiquity,  also  solved  the  Old 
Persian  cuneiform.  He  too  found  a series  of  signs  that  he  recognized  as  kings’ 
names,  identified  them,  and  broke  into  the  script.  He  recovered  rather  more 
of  the  alphabet  than  did  Grotefend,  and  this  provided  the  key  for  the  next 
and  far  more  important  step:  solution  of  the  syllabic  cuneiform  used  to  write 
Akkadian,  the  language  of  Babylonia  and  Assyria. 

In  terms  of  numbers  of  signs,  this  script  was  the  most  complicated  of  the 
three  found  at  Behistun  and  on  other  trilingual  inscriptions.  Rawlinson  and 
other  scholars  located  the  repeated  schemata  that  included  the  names  of  the 
kings.  Comparisons  of  these  with  their  sounds  and  meanings — now  known 
from  the  Old  Persian  solution— showed  that  the  Akkadian  script  was  partly 
syllabic,  partly  logographic.  For  example,  it  represented  the  word  “king”  by  a 


Ancestral  Voices 


913 


single  sign  whereas  it  spelled  out  the  names  of  the  kings  with  several  signs. 
The  number  of  signs  used  in  these  names  equalled  the  number  of  consonants 
in  them.  This  led  the  Swede  Isidor  Lowenstern  to  conclude  that  the  language 
was  Semitic,  a family  whose  later  scripts,  at  least,  write  only  the  consonants  as 
letters,  representing  the  vowels  by  points  and  lines.  However,  he  discovered 
an  abnormal  number  of  signs  representing  a single  consonant.  An  Irish 
clergyman,  Edward  Hincks,  showed  that  these  actually  stood  for  syllables 
based  on  that  consonant,  such  as  /ra/,  /ri/,  /ru/,  / ar/,  /er/,  /ir/,  /ur/.  He  also 
recognized  that  a single  sign  could  serve  as  a word-sign,  a syllable-sign,  or  a 
determinative  much  like  the  hieroglyphic  determinatives. 

Rawlinson,  meanwhile,  continued  to  substitute  new-found  phonetic 
values  back  into  the  cuneiform  texts.  At  times  the  suggested  values  appeared 
jarringly  out  of  place,  and  after  many  occurrences  in  which  a single  sign  ap- 
peared to  be  wrong  in  a word  that  context  compelled  to  be  right,  a regularity 
in  these  apparent  errors  impressed  itself  upon  him.  He  finally  concluded  that  a 
single  sign  could  possess  several  different  sound  values,  much  as  the  English  c 
can  sound  like  either  an  /s/  or  a /k/.  Thus,  in  the  Akkadian,  Rawlinson  dis- 
covered, the  sign  that  usually  represents  /ud/  can  also  stand  for  /tarn/,  /par/, 
/lah/,  and  /his/.  The  246  polyphonous  symbols  that  he  established  by  1851 
proved  in  the  long  run  to  be  almost  entirely  correct.  They  were  confirmed  by 
finding,  among  the  20,000  clay  tablets  of  the  library  of  Ashurbanipal,  about 
100  on  which  students  learning  the  complicated  language  had  correlated  the 
various  signs,  syllabic  polyphones,  and  logograms.  Only  then  was  it  possible  to 
understand  why  the  name  Nabu-kudurri-usur  (“Nebuchadnezzar”),  meaning 
“O  Nabu,  protect  my  boundary  mark,”  came  out  as  an-ag-sa-du-sis.  It 
turned  out  that  an-ag  was  a logographic  symbol  for  the  god  Na-bi-um,  sa-du 
represented  the  word  kudurru  (“boundary  mark”),  and  sis  stood  for  nasaru 
(“to  protect”),  the  imperative  form  of  which  was  usur. 

In  view  of  complexities  like  this,  it  was  hardly  surprising  that  many 
scholars  jeered  at  the  results  as  pure  imagination.  To  settle  the  question  of 
reliability,  the  Royal  Asiatic  Society  in  1857  sent  a newly  discovered  cunei- 
form inscription  to  four  experts,  Rawlinson,  Hincks,  William  Henry  Fox 
Talbert,  and  Jules  Oppert,  with  the  request  that  they  work  on  it  independently. 
The  sealed  envelopes  containing  the  four  solutions  were  opened  at  a formal 
meeting.  In  all  essential  points  their  translations  agreed. 

Within  fifteen  years,  a world  that  still  largely  believed  in  the  revelatory 
uniqueness  of  Holy  Scripture  was  reading  in  shocked  surprise  the  Epic  of 
Gilgamesh,  in  which  a story  of  an  ancient  flood  parallels  the  Biblical  narrative 
down  to  the  details  of  the  release  of  a bird  to  see  whether  the  waters  had  sub- 
sided. Then,  at  the  turn  of  the  century,  a broken  black  diorite  stele  covered 
with  3,600  lines  of  cuneiform  was  found  to  be  the  law  code  of  Hammurabi — 
with  crimes  and  punishments  and  even  phrases  that  the  later  Mosaic  Law  had 
' evidently  copied.  The  decipherment  of  cuneiform  showed  thmwlmt  the  West 
had  regarded  for  centuries  as  God-given  truths  had  come  tnerelwfrom  the

human  minds  of  a pagan  civilization  and,  by  undermining  the  divine  author- 
ity of  the  moral  law,  helped  pave  the  way  for  the  ethical  and  philosophical 
revolution  of  today.  It  revealed  so  much  about  the  ziggurat  lands  of  Assyria 
and  Babylonia,  with  their  winged  bulls,  their  bearded  kings,  their  royal  lion 
hunts,  their  astronomy,  and  their  deities  like  Marduk  and  Ishtar,  that  modern 
man  knows  far  more  about  them  than  the  most  learned  traveler  of  ancient 
Greece,  who  was  2,000  years  closer  to  them  in  time. 

Scholars  have  elucidated  many  other  lost  languages — indeed,  every  tongue 
that  has  become  extinct  and  has  been  recovered  falls  into  the  category.  Many 
involve  obscure  dialects  of  half-forgotten  peoples,  and  so  have  not  had  the 
impact  on  history  that  the  solution  of  the  hieroglyphic  and  cuneiform  writing 
of  two  great  civilizations  has  had.  Surprisingly  often,  the  basic  solution  is  the 
work  of  a single  scholar,  though  almost  invariably  his  work  is  extended  and 
checked,  usually  in  the  infinitely  detailed  field  of  philology,  by  others. 

Of  these  other  solutions,  perhaps  the  most  important  is  Bedrich  Hrozny’s 
1916  reading  of  the  Hittite  cuneiform.  The  Czech  scholar,  a lively,  generous 
man,  then  37,  read  the  Hittite  cuneiform  texts  using  the  sound-values  and 
occasional  logograms  of  Akkadian  cuneiform,  but  the  language  seemed  to 
make  no  sense.  Eventually  he  found  a sentence  that  included  the  logogram 
for  bread,  and  he  transliterated  the  rest  of  it  as:  Nu-BREAD-an  ezzateni, 
wadur-ma  ekuteni.  It  seemed  to  echo  a familiar  phrase,  and  suddenly  he  saw 
that  it  referred  to  eating  bread  and  water,  wadar  resembling  Germanic  watar 
and,  of  course,  the  English  water,  and  ezzateni  being  cognate  with  German 
essen  and  English  eat.  The  language  thus  turned  out  to  be  Indo-European, 
flying  in  the  face  of  nearly  all  philologists,  who  had  assumed  it  to  be  almost 
anything  but.  This  placed  the  language  on  the  proper  footing  for  its  reconstruc- 
tion, and  within  20  years  a satisfactory  understanding  of  it  had  been  gained. 
This  helped  clear  up  some  of  the  mystifying  details  about  the  history  of  this 
people,  who  are  mentioned  in  the  Bible  and  in  the  chronicles  of  other  ancient 
peoples.  (The  Hittites  also  wrote  in  their  own  hieroglyphics;  several  scholars, 
each  adding  a detail  or  a hypothesis  to  the  corpus  of  the  decipherment,  are 
still  laboriously  working  out  the  solution.) 

Most  of  the  other  solutions  have  come  from  Mediterranean  lands,  the  seed- 
bed of  civilization.  Meroitic,  the  language  of  the  “Ethiopian”  kingdom  of 
Meroe,  which  flourished  south  of  Egypt  from  about  100  b.c.  to  300  a.d., 
proved  to  be  an  offshoot  of  Egyptian  when  Francis  Llewellyn  Griffith  solved 
it  in  the  1920s.  Lycian,  spoken  in  southwestern  Asia  Minor,  was  in  large 
measure  deciphered  with  the  help  of  epitaphs  whose  rigid  formula  was  ascer- 
tained from  others  nearby,  written  in  Greek.  Lydian,  the  language  of  King 
Croesus,  was  read  with  the  aid  of  both  Aramaic  and  Greek  bilinguals.  Sidetic, 
spoken  in  the  city  of  Side  on  the  southern  coast  of  Asia  Minor,  could  not  be 
read  at  first  because  the  Greek  bilinguals  were  too  short;  but  a longer  one 
discovered  in  1949  enabled  Helmuth  T.  Bossert  to  make  considerable  head- 
way. In  1843,  F.  C.  de  Saulcy  read  Libyan,  also  called  Numidian,  the  language 


Ancestral  Voices

spoken  in  northwestern  Africa  at  the  time  of  Carthage  and  written  in  what 
appears  to  be  a specially  invented  script;  he  had  the  aid  of  bilinguals  in  Latin 
and  in  Punic,  the  language  of  Carthage,  and  of  philological  insights  from 
Numidian’s  modern  descendant,  the  language  of  the  Berber  tribesmen.  The 
Iberian  script,  used  in  about  150  inscriptions  found  in  Spain,  the  longest  only 
342  letters,  was  deciphered  in  the  mid- 1920s  by  Professor  Manuel  Gomez 
Moreno;  some  points  are  still  in  question.  Writings  of  South  Arabia,  such  as 
the  graceful  Sabaean  alphabet,  have  been  deciphered;  they  provide  knowledge 
of  the  earliest  dialects  of  Arabia.  The  North  Arabian  Safaitic  inscriptions, 
which  were  mainly  incised  on  volcanic  rocks  near  es-Safa  southeast  ot 
Damascus  in  the  first  two  centuries  a.d.,  were  largely  read  by  the  German  E. 
Littmann. 

James  Prinsep,  professor  of  Sanskrit  at  Oxford,  who  died  in  1840  at  age  41, 
solved  not  one  but  two  important  ancient  scripts  and  has  been  called  “one  of 
the  most  talented  and  useful  men  that  England  has  given  to  India.”  He  first 
unraveled  the  Pahlavi  script  after  finding  bilingual  coins  in  it  and  in  Greek 
from  the  Bactrian  empire  of  Persia  that  flourished  after  Alexander  the  Great. 
Greek  proper  names  on  them  suggested  the  sound  values  of  letters  in  Pahlavi, 
which  proved  to  be  Persian  written  in  a Semitic  alphabet.  Then  he  turned  his 
attention  to  the  inscriptions  of  the  Buddhist  king  Asoka,  who  in  the  third 
century  b.c.  ruled  the  greatest  empire  that  ever  existed  in  India.  They  were 
written  using  the  then-unknown  Brahmi  alphabet  in  the  common  language  of 
the  people,  Prakrit  (as  distinguished  from  the  literary  tongue,  Sanskrit).  In 
1837,  Prinsep  saw  a number  of  brief  inscriptions  on  objects  found  in  a temple 
near  Bhopal  in  Central  India  and  concluded  that  they  meant  somebody’s 
“gift”  to  the  temple.  Equating  the  known  sounds  of  the  Prakrit  word  for 
“gift”  and  of  the  Prakrit  proper  names  with  the  letters,  Prinsep  worked  out 
the  oldest  known  writing  of  India.  The  solution  filled  in  much  of  early  Indian 
history  and  some  of  the  development  of  Indian  language  and  writing,  with 
consequences  important  for  the  knowledge  of  other  Indo-European  languages. 
It  also  paved  the  way  for  Muller’s  reconstruction  of  Tokharian,  which  was 
written  in  the  Brahmi  script. 

Muller  also  played  a major  role  in  the  decipherment  of  Sogdian.  This  was 
the  lingua  franca  of  Central  Asia  during  the  first  millennium  a.d.  when  that 
melting  pot — today  a sparsely  populated  sandy  waste — was  a rich  land  of 
smiling  cities  like  Samarkand,  criss-crossed  by  caravans  bearing  spices  and 
emeralds  to  Europe.  Like  Pahlavi,  the  language  was  an  eastern  dialect  of 
Middle  Persian,  the  alphabet  also  a descendant  of  the  Aramaic. 

Other  abandoned  scripts  from  the  oddest  corners  of  the  Orient  have 
yielded  to  the  analyses  of  linguists.  Mon,  a script  employed  in  Burma  about  the 
eleventh  century  a.d.,  fell  before  the  attack  of  C.  O.  Blagden,  whose  principal 
weapon  was  a quadriliteral  of  Mon,  Pyu,  Pali,  and  Burmese.  Some  inscriptions 
in  Khmer,  a fifth-century  language  of  Cambodia,  were  solved  in  the  1920s  by 
G.  Coedes.  A group  of  scholars  collaborated  in  reading,  with  the  help  of 


916  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Sanskrit  bilinguals,  an  Indian  tongue  written  in  a script  called  Central  Asian 
Slanting  Gupta. 

The  decipherment  that  is  sometimes  cited  as  the  most  typical  of  armchair 
decipherments  involved  another  writing  from  Central  Asia.  In  1889,  explorers 
discovered  two  large  inscribed  stones  near  the  Orkhon  River  about  40  miles 
north  of  Karakorum.  A short  Chinese  text  on  one  declared  that  it  had  been 
erected  in  memory  of  a Turkish  prince  in  a year  that  corresponded  to  732  a.d. 
A second  and  longer  inscription  on  that  stone  was  graven  in  an  angular  script 
that  resembled  Germanic  runes.  Both  inscriptions  were  published  in  1892. 
The  next  year  a Danish  scholar,  Vilhelm  Thomsen,  after  failing  to  match  the 
Chinese  rendering  of  the  prince’s  name  (“K’we-te-kin”)  to  the  rune-like 
characters  that  represented  it,  discovered  that  the  Turkish  form  of  the  prince’s 
name  was  Kiil-tigin  and  matched  the  characters  to  that.  Then  he  found  the 
Turkish  word  tdngri  (“heaven”)  in  a group  that  occurred  where  the  Khan’s 
appellation  of  “Celestial”  might  appear.  These  two  words  together  contained 
all  the  characters  necessary  for  reading  a word  that  occurred  very  frequently — 
ttirk,  the  name  of  Kiil-tigin’s  people.  The  language  proved  to  be  the  oldest  and 
purest  Turkish  dialect  known,  before  it  was  affected  by  the  Moslem  conquest; 
the  script,  now  called  Kok-Turki  runes,  was  shown  by  other  discoveries  to  be 
a national  script  that  the  Turks  later  forsook.  Thus,  on  November  25,  1893, 
with  the  aid  of  a Chinese  bilingual,  Thomsen  deciphered  the  writing,  and  so 
completely  and  accurately  had  he  done  it  that  since  then  there  has  been  almost 
nothing  to  add  or  correct. 

It  must  not  be  thought  that  every  script  has  surrendered.  Many  remain 
books  sealed  with  seven  seals.  Etruscan,  written  in  Latin  letters  and  con- 
temporaneous with  the  early  Latin  culture,  is  one  of  the  most  tantalizing.  It  is 
a Case  II  problem  which  has  been  partly  solved.  A few  words  have  been 
identified  with  a fair  degree  of  probability,  but  the  8,000  texts  are  too  stereo- 
typed (many  are  funerary  inscriptions)  and  too  brief  (many  are  mere  frag- 
ments) to  allow  much  progress  to  be  made  in  reconstructing  the  language.  The 
few  bilinguals  that  exist  (with  Latin)  are  epitaphs.  The  state  of  the  question 
can  be  dramatized  by  pointing  out  that  disagreement  is  rife  concerning  even 
the  numbers,  which  have  been  found  in  written  form  on  dice. 

The  hieroglyphics  of  the  Indus  Valley  civilization,  which  flourished  in  the 
northwest  corner  of  India  more  than  4,000  years  ago,  remain  unread.  During 
World  War  II,  Hrozny,  then  in  his  dotage,  mounted  an  attack  upon  all  the 
undeciphered  scripts  of  the  world  and  announced  a decipherment  of  the 
approximately  250  signs  of  the  Indus  Valley  script,  but  other  scholars  have 
discredited  it.  Some  investigators  see  a resemblance  between  this  script  and 
that  of  the  “talking  boards”  of  Easter  Island.  A number  of  the  signs  do  look 
surprisingly  alike,  but  their  enormous  separation  in  time  and  space  makes  it 
most  unlikely  that  they  have  any  connection.  Easter  Island  natives  call  the 
writing  rongo-rongo,  and  their  tradition  holds  that  bards  merely  used  the  little

figures  of  what  appear  to  be  men  and  plants  as  cues  for  a whole  line  in  a story. 
None  of  the  native  informants  could  actually  explain  the  500  symbols  when 
they  were  discovered  in  1870,  but  Thomas  S.  Barthel  has  recently  claimed 
to  have  deciphered  the  talking-board  writing. 

Many  would-be  decipherers  have  exercised  their  ingenuity  upon  the 
Phaistos  Disk,  a circular  tablet  six  inches  in  diameter,  found  at  Phaistos  in 
Crete  in  1902.  Its  241  signs  were  printed  into  the  fine-grained  clay  with  stamps; 
the  writing  uncoils  from  the  center  in  five  spirals  on  both  sides.  Forty-five 
highly  pictorial  representations  of  humans,  animals,  tools,  and  body  parts 
form  the  signary.  This  has  led  to  statistical  calculations  that  the  original 
signary  had  between  50  and  60  pictograms.  The  disk  apparently  dates  from 
about  1 700  b.c.  Many  solutions  have  been  announced.  None  has  been  generally 
accepted. 

A Case  III  problem  which  has  caused  many  a sleepless  night  is  that  of  the 
Maya  hieroglyphics.  It  remains  unconquered,  despite  a recent  onslaught  by 
that  all-conquering  of  modern  weapons,  the  digital  computer.  Three  young 
Soviet  mathematicians  from  the  Novosibirsk  Institute  of  Mathematics  of  the 
Soviet  Academy  of  Sciences,  E.  V.  Yevreinov,  Y.  G.  Kosarev,  and  V.  A. 
Ustinov,  became  the  first  to  apply  a computer  to  a decipherment  problem. 
They  assumed  that  the  most  frequent  Mayan  glyphs  would  represent  the 
written  form  of  the  most  frequent  sounds  of  the  Mayan  language.  The  lan- 
guage, and  its  sounds,  were  known  primarily  from  Mayan  texts  written  by 
their  priests  in  the  alphabet  of  the  conquistadores,  secondarily  from  two 
Maya-Spanish  dictionaries  compiled  at  the  same  time,  thirdly  from  the 
degenerate  form  of  Mayan  still  spoken  in  Yucatan.  The  mathematicians 
codified  the  60,000  words  of  these  texts  on  the  punched  cards  and  magnetic 
drums  that  served  as  the  computer’s  memory.  They  found  that  70  letter-pairs 
in  the  texts  accounted  for  half  the  word-beginnings,  and  that  73  glyphs  simi- 
larly accounted  for  half  the  word-beginnings.  On  this  basis  they  predicated  an 
identity  between  the  two  groups,  and,  by  correlating  other  relationships 
between  endings  and  medial  groups  in  a lightning  40-hour  electronic  “deciph- 
erment,” concluded  that  they  had  solved  the  Mayan  writing.  Sample  solutions : 
“The  young  maize  god  fires  pottery  from  white  clay”;  “The  woman’s  burden 
is  the  god  of  war.”  But  criticism  both  as  to  their  general  method  and  as  to 
details  of  result  has  razed  this  elaborate  structure. 

Of  all  the  decipherments  of  history,  the  most  elegant,  the  most  coolly 
rational,  the  most  satisfying,  and  withal  the  most  surprising  occurred  in 
1952.  The  story  begins,  as  all  stories  of  the  Aegean  must,  with  Troy. 

In  the  1870s,  a wealthy  German  businessman  who  refused  to  accede  to  the 
general  opinion  that  the  Iliad  and  the  Odyssey  were  pure  myth  proved  his 
dogged  belief  that  they  enclosed  a germ  of  truth.  Heinrich  Schliemann  dis- 
covered the  site  of  the  historical  Troy  at  the  85-foot  mound  of  Hissarlik  in 
Turkey  three  miles  from  the  sea.  He  unearthed  the  thick  circuit  walls  around

which  Achilles  dragged  Hector’s  body  and  which  only  the  trickery  of  the 
wooden  horse  had  breached.  He  found  golden  cups  in  what  he  thought  was 
Priam’s  treasure.  The  site  was  right  but  his  dating  was  wrong  by  a thousand 
years.  He  thought  that  the  second  level  of  the  oft-rebuilt  city  was  Homer’s 
Troy;  an  American  expedition  in  the  1930s  under  Dr.  Carl  W.  Blegen  of  the 
University  of  Cincinnati  showed  that  the  much  later  seventh  level  of  Troy  was 
the  Ilium  that  Homer  had  immortalized. 

Homer  had  also  sung  of  “Mycenae  rich  in  gold,”  and  Schliemann,  again 
trusting  the  poet,  promptly  dug  up  at  Mycenae  on  the  mainland  of  Greece  a 
circle  of  royal  graves  in  which  the  interred  kings  wore  crowns  and  death 
masks  of  gold.  He  thought  that  these  were  the  tombs  of  Agamemnon, 
“king  of  men,”  ruler  of  Mycenae,  overlord  of  all  the  Greeks  in  the  Trojan 
War,  and  of  his  Trojan  captive  Cassandra,  both  murdered  soon  after  his 
return  by  his  wife  Clytemnestra  and  her  lover  Aegisthus.  As  with  Troy, 
Schliemann  was  hundreds  of  years  too  early.  But  his  instincts  were  magnifi- 
cently right. 

A young  British  archeologist  named  Arthur  Evans  became  curious  about 
the  writing  that  he  felt  must  have  been  used  by  the  wealthy  and  cultured  in- 
habitants of  this  era.  He  found  some  engraved  gems  in  Greece  that  had  some 
appearance  of  script,  traced  them  to  Crete,  and  began  to  dig  at  Knossos.  He 
discovered  writing,  as  he  had  hoped,  but  the  stupendous  nature  of  his  other 
discoveries  soon  drove  this  modest  original  goal  out  of  his  mind. 

For  Evans  had  excavated  the  spectacular  ruins  of  an  advanced  ancient 
civilization.  He  had  found  the  vast  palace  of  the  legendary  King  Minos,  so 
rambling  and  so  confused  in  plan  that  it  might  well  have  given  rise  to  the 
myth  that  Minos  built  a labyrinth  in  which  to  pen  the  Minotaur,  the  mon- 
strous offspring  of  his  own  queen  and  a bull.  Evans  saw  wall  frescoes  ot 
youths  grasping  the  horns  of  a bull  and  being  tossed  onto  its  back — the  bull- 
dancers  that  intimated  that  some  elements  of  the  story  of  the  Minotaur,  filtered 
through  the  dark  lenses  of  legend,  were  the  race-memory  of  actual  events. 
Scattered  through  the  palace  were  representations  of  the  royal  symbol,  the 
two-headed  ax,  in  such  profusion  that  Evans  called  the  palace  the  House  of 
the  Double  Ax.  The  civilization  he  named  Minoan,  after  its  legendary 
founder. 

Evans  had  begun  his  excavations  in  March  of  1900.  On  the  31st  of  the 
month  he  unearthed  the  first  clay  tablet  with  the  writing  he  had  originally 
sought ; on  the  6th  of  April  he  found  a whole  hoard  of  inscribed  tablets.  Some 
were  embedded  in  charred  wood,  presumably  the  remains  of  the  wooden  box 
in  which  they  were  originally  stored.  The  dull  gray  tablets  came  in  two  shapes, 
a long  and  narrow  “palm-leaf”  type  and  a 5 x 10-inch  “page”  type.  The 
Cretans  did  not  bake  the  tablets  but  merely  dried  them;  a leak  in  one  of 
Evans’  roofs  once  reduced  a boxful  to  a pulpy  mass.  The  clay  still  held  the 
fingerprints  of  the  scribes  who  had  patted  them  flat.  Most  tablets  were  broken, 
but  often  the  fragments. could  be  joined  together.

Evans  found  four  kinds  of  writing.  The  oldest  appeared  as  three-dimen- 
sional carvings  on  gems  like  those  that  had  started  his  quest  and  on  seals  an 
inch  across.  It  was  markedly  pictographic,  and  Evans  called  it  the  Hiero- 
glyphic Script  of  Class  a,  though  it  bore  no  relation  to  the  hieroglyphs  of 
Egypt.  He  found  a stylized  form  of  this  written  on  clay  which  he  called  the 
Hieroglyphic  Script  of  Class  b,  and  he  traced  further  simplifications  of  this 
into  two  forms  of  cursive  writing,  much  more  linear  than  the  hieroglyphs,  on 
the  tablets.  Evans  called  one  the  Linear  Script  of  Class  A,  and  the  other,  the 
most  recent  of  the  four  scripts,  the  Linear  Script  of  Class  b.  Linear  a was 
found  at  locations  all  over  Crete,  while  Linear  b was  found  only  at  Knossos. 
They  had  not  coexisted;  Linear  B replaced  Linear  a.  The  relationship  among 
the  four  was  not  entirely  clear.  Some  forms  progressively  simplified  from 
Hieroglyphic  a to  B to  Linear  a to  b.  But  Linear  b has  some  signs  that  do  not 
exist  in  Linear  a,  and  some  Linear  b forms  are  more  complex  than  their  ap- 
parent Linear  A counterparts.  The  linear  scripts  run  from  left  to  right. 

The  individual  signs  of  Linear  b are  rather  fanciful  and  resemble  a whole 
variety  of  objects — a Gothic  arch  enclosing  a vertical  line,  a ladder,  a heart 
with  a stem  running  through  it,  a bent  trident  with  a barb,  a three-legged 
dinosaur  looking  behind  him,  an  A with  an  extra  horizontal  bar  through  it,  a 
backward  S,  a tall  beer  glass,  half  full,  with  a bow  tied  on  its  rim;  dozens  look 
like  nothing  at  all  in  this  world.  Evans  counted  70  in  common  use  (there  were 
about  90  altogether),  and  presumed  from  this  and  from  the  average  number 
of  signs  included  between  the  upright  lines  that  often  divided  the  words  that 
“it  is  probable  that  the  signs  have  a syllabic  value.” 

The  Linear  b tablets  appeared  to  be  primarily  inventories,  lists,  business 
documents.  In  addition  to  the  signs,  they  bore  pictograms  of  horses,  chariots, 
wheels,  men,  women,  swords,  cereals,  and  so  forth,  accompanied  by  strokes 
that  evidently  indicated  the  number  of  the  depicted  item  in  a decimal  system. 
Several  tablets  were  found  with  a totaling  entry  on  the  bottom  line.  Some  tab- 
lets were  indexed  on  their  edges  so  that  the  bookkeeper  would  not  have  to 
pull  out  a whole  batch  to  get  the  one  he  needed. 

Evans  classified  the  tablets  into  groups  suggested  by  their  pictograms — 
olive  culture,  saffron  culture,  cereals,  flocks  and  herds,  chariots,  and  so  on. 
He  divided  the  signs  themselves  into  four  groups  based  on  phonetic,  ideo- 
graphic, numerical,  or  agricultural  associations.  He  listed  what  appeared  to 
be  male  and  female  names,  counted  sign-occurrences  in  the  male  group,  and 
suggested  that  regular  changes  in  names  in  the  female  group  constituted  “good 
evidences  of  declension.”  He  identified  what  he  claimed  were  determinatives 
for  royal  and  religious  words.  He  remarked  that  one  sign  looked  much  like  a 
Semitic  letter,  wisely  stopping  short  of  making  the  unsubstantiated  suggestion 
that  they  both  represented  the  same  sound. 

He  did  not  read  the  script.  The  basis  for  the  decipherment — the  language 
underlying  the  writing — remained  unknown.  Historical  considerations  pointed 
strongly  in  a certain  direction,  however.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Evans  believed  that  the  Minoan  civilization  that  he  had  uncovered  had 
dominated  the  mainland  Greeks  from  its  inception  to  its  fall.  As  evidence,  he 
cited  early  features  that  were  original  at  Knossos  and  derivative  in  the  con- 
temporaneous Mycenaean  civilization  discovered  by  Schliemann — primarily 
similar  architecture  and  the  so-called  Palace  style  of  pottery.  Given  this 
“Knossocentric”  premise,  there  followed  inexorably  the  corollary  that  the 
language  of  Linear  b was  related  to  Semitic  or  Etruscan  or  Hittite  or  to  the 
language  of  whatever  racial  stock,  probably  non-Indo-European,  that  had 
first  ruled  in  Crete.  Had  the  language  of  Linear  b been  the  Greek  that  the 
Mycenaeans  presumably  spoke — which  seemed  improbable  in  the  first  place, 
because  the  script  presumably  would  have  been  a relatively  easy  Case  I 
solution — Evans’  thesis  would  have  been  untenable.  But  an  apparent 
demonstration  that  the  language  was  not  Greek  seemed  to  prove  the  Minoan 
hegemony. 

Linear  b strikingly  resembled  the  writing  used  centuries  later  on  the 
nearby  Mediterranean  island  of  Cyprus.  The  general  configurations  of  the 
characters  agreed,  and  some  signs  matched  perfectly.  Scholars  could  read  the 
Cypriote  script,  in  use  from  700  to  100  b.c.,  because  the  English  Assyriologist 
George  Smith  had  deciphered  it  in  the  1870s.  The  number  of  its  characters — 
55 — had  convinced  him  that  they  represented  syllables.  In  a bilingual  inscrip- 
tion of  Phoenician  and  Cypriote,  Smith  picked  out  the  two  Cypriote  words 
corresponding  to  the  two  Phoenician  occurrences  of  “king.”  The  next-to-last 
signs  in  the  Cypriote  differed  from  one  word  to  the  other.  From  their  positions 
in  the  text,  Smith  decided  that  the  differences  resulted  from  declension — one 
form  being  the  nominative  case,  “king,”  the  other  the  genitive  case,  “of  the 
king.”  He  then  looked  for  a neighboring  language  in  which  the  next-to-last 
syllables  of  the  word  “king”  varied  from  the  nominative  to  genitive.  He  found 
the  Greek  basileus,  nominative,  and  basileos,  genitive.  With  this  and  the  help 
of  proper  names,  “I  thus  obtained,  with  more  or  less  certainty,  the  phonetic 
values  of  eighteen  of  the  Cypriote  characters,  and  I tried  by  means  of  this 
help  to  decipher  the  remainder  of  the  inscription.  Unfortunately,  the  parts  of 
the  Cypriote  inscription  which  contained  the  rest  of  the  proper  names  were 
mutilated. . . .”  On  the  evidence  of  basileus  and  other  similarities  with  Greek, 
he  thought  that  “the  language  was  allied  to,  although  not  the  same  as,  the 
Greek.”  At  this  point  Smith  quit  the  problem,  partly  because  he  could  not  go 
any  further,  partly  because  he  was  about  to  set  out  on  the  expedition  that  was 
to  find  the  Babylonian  tablets  of  the  Flood  and  the  Gilgamesh  Epic. 

His  work  was  continued  by  others,  particularly  Samuel  Birch,  Johannes 
Brandis,  and  Moriz  Schmidt.  Eventually  it  became  clear  that  the  language 
was  Greek,  but  written  in  a script  so  utterly  unlike  the  familiar  alphabetic 
system  of  Greek  that  it  seemed  mangled  almost  beyond  recognition.  The 
signs  of  this  script  could  represent  only  pure  vowels  or  syllables  in  the  form  of 
consonant-vowel;  single  consonants,  vowel-consonant  groups,  and  conson- 
ant-vowel-consonant  groups  were  excluded.  Among  other  peculiarities,  the 


Ancestral  Voices 


921 


script  did  not  distinguish  the  sounds  of  /ta,  da,  tha/,  but  used  a single  sign 
for  all  of  them.  It  ignored  nasals  before  a consonant:  “panta”  (“all”)  was 
written  pa-ta.  It  wrote  consonants  at  the  end  of  a word  with  an  unpronounced 
auxiliary  vowel : “theois”  (“to  the  gods”)  becomes  te-o-i-se.  A syllable  begin- 
ning with  two  consonants  had  to  be  written  as  if  with  two  syllables.  All  this 
imparted  a barbarous  awkwardness  to  the  written  language  of  the  Greeks  of 
Cyprus,  which  was  contemporary  and  similar  to  that  spoken  by  the  mainland 
Greeks  during  their  Golden  Age.  The  Greek  “anthropos”  (“man”)  appeared 
in  Cypriote  as  a-to-ro-po-se. 

Evans  pointed  out  the  similarity  of  this  script  to  the  Cretan  ones  and  may 
even  have  tried  to  decipher  Linear  a and  b with  the  Cypriote  values.  If  so,  he 
failed,  as  others  who  did  try  it  later  failed.  A singular  fact  seemed  to  ratify 
this  failure.  The  most  common  final  consonant  in  Greek  is  s,  which  the 
Cypriote  script  rendered  as  se.  Now,  the  Cypriote  sign  for  se  is  identical  to  one 
of  the  Linear  b signs.  But  in  Linear  b this  sign  rarely  ends  words.  This  pheno- 
menon repelled  the  hypothesis  that  Greek  underlay  Linear  b.  The  failures, 
plus  this  linguistic  evidence,  reinforced  Evans’  archeological  evidence  for  his 
Knossocentric  thesis  of  Crete’s  dominance  over  Greece.  His  own  magisterial 
prestige  soon  elevated  it  to  orthodoxy. 

Yet  a few  brave  heretics  challenged  it.  Brave  they  had  to  be:  one,  Alan 
J.  B.  Wace,  paid  for  his  impudence  with  an  unwanted  retirement  from  the 
British  School  in  Athens  in  1923  and  with  exclusion  from  work  in  the  Minoan 
field  for  several  years.  The  heretics  differed  with  Evans  only  for  the  period 
from  1450  b.c.  to  the  end  of  the  Bronze  Age  in  1 125  b.c.  These  years  encom- 
passed the  heroic  age  of  Greece  and  the  Trojan  War  (about  1240  b.c.)  and  are 
consequently  of  supreme  importance;  the  Linear  b tablets  were  written  during 
this  time.  Both  schools  of  thought  agreed  that,  earlier  in  the  Bronze  Age, 
before  1450,  Crete  prevailed  in  the  Aegean.  The  legend  of  Athens’  subjugation 
to  Minos  and  its  annual  tribute  of  seven  youths  and  seven  maidens  to  the 
Minotaur,  eventually  slain  by  the  Athenian  hero  Theseus,  may  mount  from 
this  time  as  a kind  of  literary  artifact.  This  period,  in  which  Linear  a was 
used,  ended  with  the  destruction,  by  earthquake  and  fire,  of  the  original 
Palace  of  Minos. 

Wace  and  the  others  felt  that  Evans  had  ignored  important  evidence  for 
the  questioned  years.  Archeological  evidence,  such  as  size  of  palaces,  in- 
creasingly showed  that  the  mainland  was  rising  in  power  and  influence  during 
and  just  prior  to  these  years  and  that  Crete  was  declining.  This,  Wace  thought, 
made  a mainland  domination  of  Crete  more  likely  than  the  reverse. 

A 1939  discovery  gave  this  theory  an  enormous  boost.  After  finishing  his 
work  at  Troy,  Carl  Blegen  excavated  at  Pylos  in  Greece.  He  unearthed  the 
palace  of  Nestor,  the  oldest  of  the  Greek  chieftains  at  Troy,  wise  and  gar- 
rulous, one  of  the  Argonauts  who  sailed  with  Jason  in  quest  of  the  Golden 
Fleece.  Blegen’s  very  first  trench  ran  through  the  archives  room,  where  he 
found  600  fragments  of  clay  tablets  inscribed  in  Linear  b.  If  Linear  b repre- 


922 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


sented  the  language  of  Minoan  culture,  why  should  it  be  found  only  at  Knossos 
and  nowhere  else  on  its  native  Crete,  and  yet  be  in  use  by  a Greek  king  for 
keeping  his  accounts  on  the  mainland  far  from  its  home?  Wace  theorized  that 
Pylos  was  a home  of  Linear  b and  that  conquering  Greeks  brought  it  to 
Knossos.  Unfortunately,  this  virtually  required  Linear  b to  be  Greek,  and  the 
probabilities  appeared  to  stand  strongly  against  this.  Evans’  words  boomed 
out  in  victorious  affirmation  of  this  thesis:  “. . . there  is  no  palace  either  at 
Mycenae  or  at  Thebes  for  Greek-speaking  dynasts  . . . the  culture,  like  the 
language,  was  still  Minoan  to  the  core.” 

Despite  Evans’  confidence,  only  the  solution  of  the  language  could  de- 
finitely confirm  or  deny  his  statement.  And  this  looked  far  off.  Evans  had,  in 
1909,  published  the  hieroglyphic  inscriptions  then  known  and  a couple  of  the 
Linear  A tablets  from  Knossos  in  his  folio-sized  Scripta  Minoa  I,  but  only  14 
of  the  approximately  1,600  Linear  b tablets  that  he  had  unearthed.  In  1935,  he 
presented  120  more  during  a richly  suggestive  160-page  discussion  of  them  in 
the  second  part  of  the  fourth  and  final  volume  of  his  magnum  opus,  The 
Palace  of  Minos.  But  he  never  carried  out  his  intention  of  publishing  the 
main  corpus  of  the  tablets  in  successive  volumes  of  the  Scripta  Minoa  series, 
and  at  his  death  in  1941,  aged  90,  it  was  still  closed  to  scholars.  Custom  in 
archeology  gives  the  discoverer  the  privilege  of  publishing  his  finds  first,  but 
it  imposes  in  return  the  duty  of  publishing  them  promptly.  Evans  has  there- 
fore been  taxed  with  depriving  two  generations  of  scholars  of  the  opportunity 
of  working  on  Linear  b.  The  only  other  Linear  b texts  that  were  generally 
known  were  38  of  the  Knossian  tablets,  published  by  the  Finnish  professor 
Johannes  Sundwall,  who  incurred  Evans’  displeasure  for  even  that  small 
breach  of  archeological  etiquette.  World  War  II  forced  Blegen  to  cache  his 
trove  in  the  vaults  of  the  Bank  of  Athens  and  prevented  him  from  publish- 
ing it. 

Despite  the  insufficiency  of  material,  many  would-be  decipherers  had 
attacked  the  puzzle.  In  1931,  for  example,  F.  G.  Gordon  went  Through  Basque 
to  Minoan  and  came  out  in  a never-never  land  in  which  the  Knossos  inven- 
tories read  like  elegiac  poems.  Miss  Florence  Melian  Stawell  dared  to  counter 
Evans  by  seeing  Greek  in  the  Minoan  scripts.  She  arbitrarily  assigned  a syl- 
labic or  alphabetic  value  to  each  hieroglyphic  or  Linear  a sign  based  on  the 
Greek  name  of  the  object  shown  on  the  tablets,  permitting  herself  a good 
many  terms  “which  had  died  out  before  Homer.”  Difficulties  with  Linear  b 
compelled  her  to  read  each  sign  as  a whole  word,  with  the  absurd  result  that 
the  words,  which  were  divided  by  vertical  lines,  became  in  her  view  whole 
sentences. 

The  error  of  her  ways  was  demonstrated  in  a 1940  article  in  the  American 
Journal  of  Archaeology  by  one  M.  G.  F.  Ventris,  who,  whoever  he  was,  was 
evidently  not  a professional  archeologist,  since,  where  most  contributors 
listed  their  university  affiliations,  he  gave  only  “London.”  Yet  his  article  was 
good  enough  to  be  published.  Ventris  cleared  the  field  of  opposition  views — 


Ancestral  Voices 


923 


“The  theory  that  Minoan  could  be  Greek  is  based  of  course  on  a deliberate 
disregard  for  historical  plausibility,  and  the  wonder  is  that  the  Greek  readings 
have  been  got  into  publishable  form  at  all”— before  presenting  his  own  case 
for  a similarity  with  Etruscan.  He  based  it  upon  the  lack  in  both  Etruscan 
and  the  Cypriote  syllabary  of  the  voiced  stops  /b/,  /g /,  / d/  and  the  apparent 
derivation  of  Cypriote  from  Minoan.  He  deciphered  some  Linear  b names 
with  the  help  of  the  syllabary  and  obtained  some  “name-radicals,”  which  did 
not  add  much  except  confusion.  Concluded  Ventris  bravely:  “It  [the  decipher- 
ment] can  be  done.” 

Meanwhile,  Bedrich  Hrozny,  who  had  disposed  of  the  Indus  Valley  hiero- 
glyphics to  his  satisfaction,  knifed  through  Linear  b with  a facility  that  made 
everyone  who  had  been  stymied  by  its  difficulties  look  like  fools.  He  assigned 
the  phonetic  value  /ha/  to  a Linear  b sign,  for  example,  on  the  basis  of  resem- 
blances that  he  saw  between  it  and  a Hittite  sign  for  ha,  an  Egyptian  sign  for 
he,  a Sabaean  for  h,  a Carian  and  Etruscan  for  kh,  and  a Phrygian  for  y.  He 
related  another  sign  to  a value  deduced  from  his  Indus  Valley  decipherment. 
The  solution  consisted  of  a hodgepodge  of  words  from  a mixture  of  different 
actual  and  derived  languages.  Critics  condemned  it  on  methodological, 
philological,  and  evidentiary  grounds.  “When  the  decipherer  is  as  thoroughly 
acquainted  with  as  many  languages  as  Hrozny  certainly  is,”  one  critic  ob- 
served gently,  “the  range  of  possible  satisfactory  combinations  of  sound  and 
sense  is  very  large,  and  few  inscriptions  will  seem  entirely  without  sense.” 
Most  importantly,  Hrozny’s  readings  did  not  correspond  to  what  the  tablets 
appeared  to  be  talking  about. 

At  about  the  same  time,  Vladimir  Georgiev  of  the  University  of  Sofia 
offered  an  81 -page  decipherment.  He  wrote  that  his  study  of  Aegean  place- 
names  and  Greek  vocabulary  had  established  that  the  Linear  b language  was 
an  unknown  Indo-European  tongue  which  he  named  Pelasgian  or  Eteocretan. 
His  readings  seemed  arbitrary,  however,  and  did  not  secure  conviction. 

Essays  more  modest  appeared  from  time  to  time.  In  1950,  the  German 
scholar  Ernst  Sittig,  who  had  served  in  the  German  Foreign  Office  crypto- 
logic section  from  1919  to  1924,  assumed  that  the  language  underlying  some 
non-Greek  inscriptions  written  in  the  Cypriote  syllabary  was  related  to 
Minoan.  He  then  matched  these  signs  to  Linear  b on  the  basis  ot  resem- 
blances in  form  and  in  frequency,  and  announced  the  identification  of  14 
signs.  With  these  as  a start,  he  began  work  to  recover  the  Minoan  language. 

The  most  valuable  of  the  limited  studies  was  a series  of  articles  by  Dr. 
Alice  B.  Kober,  assistant  professor  of  classical  studies  at  Brooklyn  College. 
In  1944  she  presented  a close  textual  analysis  of  tablets  with  an  adze  ideo- 
gram, and  in  1945  pointed  out  that  the  final  signs  in  words  on  ten  "chariot 
tablets  varied.  As  Evans  had  suggested  ten  years  earlier,  she  concluded  that 
“it  is  highly  probable  that  the  language  of  the  Linear  Class  b documents  was 
inflected.” 

In  an  inflected  language,  changes  in  the  form  of  words — usually  endings — 


924 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


indicate  differences  in  tense,  gender,  number,  person,  case,  and  so  on.  Only 
a few  such  changes,  or  inflections,  survive  in  English.  An  -s  on  nouns  marks  a 
plural.  An  -ed  on  verbs  indicates  past  tense.  Inflections  are  much  more  com- 
mon in  older  languages,  as  anyone  who  has  grappled  with  Latin  grammar 
knows.  Thus,  where  English  would  use  the  simple  form  earth  in  all  cases,  Latin 
declines  it  from  terra  to  terrae,  terrae,  terrain,  and  so  on,  depending  on 
whether  it  is  a singular  noun  in  the  nominative  case,  the  genitive  case,  the 
dative  case,  or  some  other  case.  The  part  of  the  word  that  does  not  change — 
terr — is  the  stem. 

“If  a language  has  inflection,”  Miss  Kober  wrote,  “certain  signs  are 
bound  to  appear  over  and  over  again  in  certain  positions  of  the  written  words.” 
She  detected  such  repetition,  though  she  conceded  that  “the  types  of  inflection 
used,  and  their  significance  are  still  unknown.”

The  Linear  b nouns  that  Alice  Kober  used  in  her  original  analyses 


The  next  year  she  identified  the  signs  that  constituted  the  inflections.  She 
began  by  assuming  that  the  words  in  a tablet  headed  with  the  ideogram  for 
“woman”  were  all  nouns  (probably  names)  and  all  in  the  same  case.  Then  she 
postulated  that  “if  a certain  sign  or  group  of  signs  occurs  regularly  or  with 
fair  frequency  as  a word  ending  in  a given  inscription  . . . this  ending  is  usual 
for  . . . the  particular  case.”  In  Latin,  the  -ae  of  the  genitive  singular  will  recur 
in  terrae , fossae,  barbae,  and  so  on.  She  found  a sign  that  recurred  thus 
frequently  as  a word  ending.  It  looked  like  a ladder  and  was  referred  to  for 
typographical  convenience  as  “7.”  She  labeled  it  the  ending  for  Case  1.  She 
could  not  tell,  of  course,  whether  the  case  was  nominative,  accusative,  or 
what.  Next  she  looked  in  other  tables  for  the  same  words  with  a different 
common  ending.  She  could  recognize  the  “same”  words  by  the  invariant 
stem.  She  found  another  ending,  which  looked  somewhat  like  a 5,  referred  to 
as  “40,”  and  labeled  it  the  Case  II  ending. 

When  she  had  done  this  for  all  the  common  endings,  she  found  several 
nouns  that  were  declined  in  three  cases.  For  her  analysis,  she  in  effect  picked 
out  a pair  that  exhibited  some  puzzling  characteristics  and  concentrated  on 


Ancestral  Voices 


925 


them,  hoping  that  explaining  the  characteristics  would  help  solve  Linear  b. 
The  two  nouns  thus  chosen  may  be  tagged  by  letting  jk  represent  the  signs  of 
the  stem  of  one  and  lm  the  signs  of  the  stem  of  the  other.  She  set  them  out  in 
two  paradigms,  each  listing  all  forms  of  one  word: 


Case  I

Miss  Kober  then  dared  a conjecture  that  might  explain  these  variations. 
Suppose,  she  said,  that  the  signs  of  the  Linear  b syllabary  could  represent  only 
either  pure  vowels  or  syllables  of  consonant-vowel  formation.  She  based  this 
assumption  upon  the  resemblance  of  the  Linear  b to  the  Cypriote  syllabary, 
which  could  express  sounds  only  in  that  very  way — syllables  like  a and  da 
permitted,  syllables  like  ad  and  dap  and  lone  consonants  like  d excluded. 

Suppose  further,  she  said,  that  both  the  jk  and  lm  stems  ended  in  con- 
sonants. This  assumption  was  justified;  most  stems  in  most  languages  seem  to 
end  in  consonants — hom  for  Latin  homo,  for  example.  The  end  of  the  stem 
would  be  followed  by  the  beginning  of  the  inflection,  and  in  a Cypriote-like 
syllabary,  the  consonant  would  have  to  be  followed  by  a vowel.  Thus  the 
syllabary  would  link  together  in  a single  sign  the  consonant  of  the  stem 
ending  and  the  vowel  of  the  inflection’s  beginning — the  m and  the  o of  homo 
into  mo,  if  Latin  had  been  written  in  that  syllabary.  Such  a sign  would  straddle 
or  bridge  the  natural  division  between  stem  and  inflection.  It  would  stand 
with  one  foot  in  the  stem  and  the  other  in  the  inflection,  the  first  foot  being  a 
consonant,  the  second  a vowel.  It  may  be  called  a “bridge  sign.” 

Now  in  a paradigm,  the  first  vowel  of  the  case  ending  often  varies  as  part  of 
the  variation  that  differentiates  one  case  from  another.  Thus,  in  the  Latin 
paradigm  dominus,  domini,  domino,  the  first  vowel  of  the  inflection  is  succes- 
sively u,  i,  and  o.  Hence,  in  a Cypriote-like  syllabary,  the  bridge  signs  that 
would  incorporate  these  varying  vowels  would  themselves  vary,  because  nu, 
ni,  no  would  necessarily  have  different  signs.  Miss  Kober  observed  this  pheno- 
menon in  the  variation  between  signs  2 and  59  in  the  jk  noun  and  between 
signs  36  and  20  in  the  lm  noun.  She  therefore  regarded  them  as  bridge  signs. 
But — concentrating  on  jk — signs  2 and  59  each  stand  with  one  foot  on  the 
unchanging  final  consonant  of  the  stem.  Thus  both  these  signs  begin  with  the 
same  consonant.  For  generality,  Miss  Kober  illustrated  this  principle  with  an 
Akkadian  noun,  sadanu , whose  stem  is  sad-  and  whose  case  endings  are  -anu, 
-ani,  and  -u:

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Miss  Kober  did  not  suggest  that  these  were  the  actual  meanings  of  the 
Linear  b signs.  She  simply  wanted  to  demonstrate  how  signs  2 and  59  shared 
the  fixed  consonant  of  the  stem.  By  the  same  reasoning,  signs  36  and  20  of  the 
lm  noun  began  with  a consonant  in  common.  In  neither  noun  did  she  know 
what  the  consonant  might  be.  (She  could  not  draw  any  conclusions  about 
signs  7 and  40,  for  though  in  Akkadian  they  happened  to  have  the  same 
consonant,  in  Linear  b they  might  not.  Case  II  might  be  something  like  sadalo.) 

The  Brooklyn  College  scholar  thus  ascertained  that  some  signs  shared  a 
common  consonant.  She  thereby  drove  the  thin  edge  of  a wedge  into  the 
theretofore  unbreached  facade  of  Linear  b.  In  her  next  move,  Miss  Kober 
widened  this  crack  into  a substantial  fissure. 

She  cross-compared  the  jk  and  lm  nouns.  She  recalled  her  original  search 
and  conclusions:  jk  and  lm  had  the  same  signs  at  their  tails  and  so  had  the 
same  case  endings.  She  focused  on  Case  I.  Since  both  words  had  the  same 
case  endings,  both  contributed  the  same  vowel  to  their  respective  bridge 
signs — 2 in  jk,  36  in  lm.  But  if  the  vowels  were  the  same,  why  were  the  bridge 
signs  different?  Because,  she  answered  herself,  jk  was  a different  word  from 
lm,  the  different  words  had  different  stems,  and  the  different  stems  furnished 
different  final  consonants  to  the  bridge  signs.  Therefore  they  differed.  But  the 
vowel  did  not  change.  It  remained  the  same  in  both  bridge  signs.  And  so  Miss 
Kober  ascertained  two  signs  that  had  a vowel  in  common. 

The  situation  can  be  depicted  with  the  made-up  word  petanu,  of  the 
same  declension  as  sadanu,  and  consequently  with  the  same  endings  -anu,  -ani, 
and  -u.

Even  though  signs  2 and  36  differ  because  they  have  different  stem  conson- 
ants, they  have  the  vowel  of  the  case  ending  in  common.  Likewise  59  and  20 
have  a vowel  in  common. 

Miss  Kober  had  thus  discovered  some  Linear  b signs  that  had  vowels  in 
common  and  some  that  had  consonants  in  common.  Some  signs  belonged  to 
both  groups,  and  when  this  occurred  she  could  arrange  them  in  a two- 
dimensional  pattern,  with  the  signs  sharing  the  same  vowel  in  a single  row 
and  those  sharing  the  same  consonant  in  a single  column:

Her  method  was  ingenious,  rigorous,  and  powerful  in  the  extreme.  It 
precluded  wild  guesses  as  to  the  meaning  of  a sign,  for  any  phonetic  assump- 
tion would  have  to  validate  itself  with  the  consonants  of  its  column  in  the 
pattern  and  the  vowels  of  its  row.  In  other  words,  if  du  looked  good  for  59,  d 
would  have  to  make  sense  as  a consonant  wherever  2 appeared,  and  u as  a 
vowel  wherever  20  appeared.  At  the  same  time,  it  would  suggest  new  values. 
If  du  was  59,  then  the  insertion  of  d?  wherever  2 appeared,  as  in  ??-d?-nu, 
might  suggest  that  2 was  da,  giving  a new  vowel  value.  Then  36  would  have  to 
be  ?a,  and  this  in  turn  might  suggest  ta  to  make  ??-ta-nu. 

Miss  Kober  purposely  refrained  from  the  critical  step  of  assigning  phonetic 
values  to  the  signs  because  she  felt  it  unwarranted  with  the  paucity  of  material 
then  available.  But  she  wrung  a few  more  details  from  the  tablets,  such  as  the 
demonstration  that  the  two  forms  of  a two-sign  word  at  the  foot  of  several 
lists  represented  masculine  and  feminine  forms  of  “total.”  Most  important, 
by  1948  she  had  extended  her  consonant  and  vowel  equivalents  from  four  signs 
to  ten,  which  she  arranged  in  a “tentative  phonetic  pattern”  two  vowels  deep 
and  five  consonants  wide.  Two  years  later,  aged  43,  she  was  dead  of  cancer. 

A few  months  before  her  death  in  May,  1950,  she  had  received  a question- 
naire on  the  Linear  b problem  from  Michael  Ventris,  who  had  propounded  the 
Etruscan  theory  in  the  American  Journal  of  Archaeology  in  1940.  The  ten-year 
hiatus  in  his  work  was  the  result  of  interruptions  by  World  War  II,  in  which 
he  served  as  a navigator  in  a Royal  Air  Force  bomber,  and  by  his  studies  at 
the  Architectural  Association  School  in  London,  from  which  he  was  graduated 
with  honors  in  1948.  For  Ventris  was  an  architect,  not  a professional  scholar, 
and  he  was  not  yet  30.  He  had  written  his  1940  paper  when  he  was  only  18,  a 
fact  that  he  had  carefully  concealed  from  the  editor  and  that  makes  the 
article’s  acceptance  all  the  more  impressive. 

He  was  born  on  July  12,  1922.  His  father  was  a British  Army  officer  in 
India,  his  mother  a beautiful  woman  who  brought  Michael  up  in  an  artistic 
atmosphere.  He  himself  was  uncommonly  handsome.  He  went  to  school  in 
Switzerland  and  then  won  a scholarship  to  Stowe  School  in  England.  His 
aptitude  for  languages  was  marked:  he  taught  himself  some  Polish  (his  mother 
was  half  Polish)  when  he  was  6,  and  as  a young  man  learned  enough  Swedish 
in  a few  weeks  to  get  a temporary  job  in  Sweden.  He  had  been  taught  in 
French  and  German  in  Switzerland,  and  had  studied  Greek  at  Stowe.  He 
combined  a remarkable  visual  memory  with  a good  ear.  As  an  architect,  he 
worked  for  a while  designing  schools  for  the  Ministry  of  Education,  and  in 
1956  won  the  first  research  fellowship  awarded  by  the  Architects'  Journal. 
His  wife,  also  an  architect,  designed  a modern  home  for  them  and  their  two 
children.  By  all  accounts  he  was  charming  and  modest,  serious  yet  with  an 
occasional  flash  of  gaiety,  affable,  able  to  explain  things  simply,  and 
brilliant. 

Ventris’  interest  in  the  Linear  b problem  had  been  roused  when,  at  14,  he 
heard  Sir  Arthur  Evans  himself  lecture  on  fabulous  Crete  and  its  mysterious

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


writing.  At  that  impressionable  age,  when  so  many  lifetime  enthusiasms  are 
formed,  he  took  up  the  challenge  of  the  undeciphered  script,  reading  the  litera- 
ture and,  later,  corresponding  with  the  experts.  The  publication  of  seven 
newly  discovered  tablets  in  1950  encouraged  him  to  resume  his  analyses, 
beginning  by  determining  the  “state  of  the  art.”  The  questionnaire  that  he 
sent  Miss  Kober  in  1950  also  went  to  eleven  other  scholars  who  he  knew  were 
working  on  Linear  b.  Ten  of  the  twelve  answered.  Hrozny,  then  past  70,  did 
not,  nor  did  Miss  Kober,  who  believed — with  some  justification — that  discus- 
sion of  unproved  theories  is  a waste  of  time.  Ventris  circulated  the  replies, 
which  summarized  what  was  known  about  Linear  b 50  years  after  Evans’ 
discovery  of  the  first  tablets  and  which  has  come  to  be  called  the  “Mid- 
Century  Report.”  The  consensus  was  that  the  underlying  language  was  prob- 
ably related  to  Hittite;  a minority,  including  Ventris,  held  that  it  was  more 
closely  related  to  Etruscan. 

In  1951,  556  of  the  Linear  b tablets  that  Carl  Blegen  had  found  at  Pylos  in 
1939  were  published,  thus  at  one  stroke  quadrupling  the  quantity  of  text 
available  for  study — the  Evans  tablets  still  not  having  been  released.  The 
publication  of  Blegen’s  find  was  supervised  by  one  of  Blegen’s  students, 
Emmett  L.  Bennett,  Jr.  Bennett,  who  had  worked  as  a cryptanalyst  during 
World  War  II,  had  written  his  doctoral  thesis  on  “The  Minoan  Linear  Script 
from  Pylos.”  Like  Miss  Kober,  he  proceeded  with  caution;  progress  was 
slower  than  if  he  had  attacked  the  problem  wholesale  with  sign  substitutions 
and  the  like,  but  it  was  substantially  surer.  In  a 1950  article,  he  clarified  the 
numerical  and  mensural  systems  of  both  Linear  a and  b.  But  his  greatest  con- 
tribution was  the  establishment  of  the  signary  by  recognizing  variant  forms. 
This  first  step,  which  can  be  quite  difficult  in  an  unknown  script — and  some- 
times is  not  easy  with  just  an  unfamiliar  handwriting — supports  all  the  rest; 
it  is  therefore  essential,  but  no  one  before  Bennett  had  really  done  it.  Bennett 
also  classified  the  signs  according  to  their  form  and  established  an  order 
which  others  numbered  to  make  it  easier  to  cite  the  signs  in  print. 

By  then  Ventris  was  circulating  Work  Notes  averaging  eight  pages  each 
that  he  duplicated  and  mailed  at  his  own  expense  to  two  dozen  interested 
scholars.  These  notes  reported  his  theories,  comparisons,  wild  surmises.  He 
was,  in  a sense,  working  in  public,  allowing  each  of  his  steps  to  be  seen  and 
criticized  by  his  colleagues,  and — what  is  frequently  important  among  scholars, 
who  are  rewarded  in  fame  and  honor  and  not  in  cash — risking  that  his  sug- 
gestions might  touch  off  a train  of  thought  in  a colleague’s  mind,  letting  him 
achieve  the  final  solution.  The  first  Work  Note,  mailed  out  in  January,  1951, 
reviewed  the  evidence  for  inflection  and  for  Miss  Kober’s  phonetic  pattern. 
Ventris  adopted  it — though  he  placed  the  vowels  at  the  top,  the  consonants 
at  the  side — and  called  it  a “grid.”  He  drove  nails  into  a board  and  hung  tags 
on  them  marked  with  the  Linear  B signs. 

The  second  Work  Note  suggested  that  a button-like  sign  represented  an 
enclitic  “and” — a conjunction  like  the  Latin  suffix  “-que,”  which  was  tacked 


Ancestral  Voices 


929 


onto  the  end  of  words,  as  in  “Senatus  Populusque  Romanus,”  the  full  form 
of  SPQR,  “the  Senate  and  the  people  of  Rome.”  Several  succeeding  Work 
Notes  tested  possible  parallels  with  a postulated  Aegean  language  or  with 
Etruscan,  which  Ventris  still  regarded  as  the  probable  answer.  And  all  this 
time  he  was  slowly  filling  in  the  grid  by  repeating  Miss  Kober’s  technique 
of  comparing  words  to  determine  signs  sharing  the  same  vowels  and  con- 
sonants. He  moved  the  tags  from  one  nail  to  another  as  he  tested  assumptions, 
noting  whether  a sign  hung  in  a certain  column  seemed  to  have  the  same 
vowel  as  the  signs  already  there. 

Work  Note  8 tabulated  the  frequencies  of  each  sign  as  initial,  final,  or 
medial.  The  enormous  frequency  of  three  signs  at  the  beginning  of  words — one 
looking  like  a double  ax,  the  second  a throne,  the  third  like  an  A with  an 
extra  bar — suggested  that  they  might  be  pure  vowels.  In  languages  written 
syllabically,  statistics  showed,  the  pure  vowels  have  the  highest  initial  fre- 
quencies. Ventris  thought,  as  others  had  privately,  that  the  double  ax  repre- 
sented a and  the  throne  i.  The  assignments  of  pure  vowels  were  independent 
of  the  grid;  they  did  not  affect  it  nor  it  them. 

The  next  Work  Note  set  forth  evidence  that  certain  signs  represented 
similar  sounds.  Ventris  observed  that  certain  words  exhibited  slight  differ- 
ences in  spelling  and,  because  these  words  occurred  in  identical  sentences,  he 
concluded  that  the  differences  represented,  not  inflection,  but  slight  variations 
in  pronunciation.  One  scribe  might  write  “father,”  another — from  the  Knos- 
sos  equivalent  of  Brooklyn — might  set  down  “fadder.”  No  dictionaries  ex- 
isted to  standardize  spelling;  the  scribes  wrote  what  they  heard.  Ventris, 
coming  across  such  variations  in  identical  contexts,  assumed  that  /th/  and 
/dd/  represented  similar  sounds.  He  could  then  place  them  in  either  the  same 
column  or  the  same  row  of  the  grid,  depending  on  whether  the  consonant  or 
the  vowel  varied,  information  that  came  from  other  sources.  These  spelling 
variations  greatly  expanded  the  grid. 

Work  Note  10  resumed  the  discussion  of  the  enclitic  “and.”  Work  Note 
1 1 showed  that  two  alternating  phrases  represented  male  and  female  genders 
of  “servant.”  Work  Note  12  classified  the  sign-groups  into  what  Ventris 
thought  were  personal  names,  names  of  institutions  or  places,  names  of  trades 
and  titles  applied  to  men  and  women,  and  a general  vocabulary.  Work  Notes 
13  and  14  showed  that  men’s  names  were  declined  in  at  least  six  different 
declensions.  The  lack  of  a regular  sign  for  a nominative  ending  in  -s  militated 
against  Greek  or  any  related  Indo-European  language.  Work  Notes  15  and  17 
expanded  the  grid  and  proposed  a few  tentative  phonetic  assignments.  By 
September  28,  1951,  Ventris,  in  Athens,  drafted  a grid  in  his  beautiful  hand 
that  inserted  50  signs  in  its  85  cells. 

During  the  winter  of  1951-52  Ventris  made  advances  in  elucidating  a 
variety  of  minor  points.  In  February,  1952,  appeared  Scripta  Minoa  II, 
edited  by  the  elderly  Sir  John  Myres,  Evans’  old  colleague,  and  presenting  at 
last  the  tablets  that  Evans  had  found  half  a century  before.  Work  Note  19  of 


930 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


March  20  gave  considerable  space  to  possible  parallels  in  Etruscan  for  the 
inflectional  activity  of  a particular  sign. 

Ventris  then  took  up  a puzzling  spelling  variation  that  had  grown  more 
evident  with  the  publication  of  Scripta  Minoa  II.  To  improve  the  symmetry 
of  a corner  of  the  grid  in  the  light  of  this  feature,  he  returned  to  the  value  jo 
for  a sign  for  which  he  had,  in  Work  Note  9,  summarily  rejected  that  value. 
This  would  make  the  many  men’s  names  end  (in  the  genitive)  in  -jo  or  -jojo 
(the  j is  a semiconsonant,  like  y).  Ventris  found  precedents  for  this  in  deriva- 
tive Greek,  Etruscan,  and  Lycian  names.  The  grid  automatically  compelled 
every  sign  in  that  column  to  share  the  vowel  -o.  Ventris  thought  that  the 
throne  sign  was  i and — even  though  the  grid  did  not  require  him  to  do  so — 
gave  the  same  vowel  to  the  signs  that  he  had  placed  in  that  column.  This  was 
bolstered  by  the  near  identity  of  the  sign  for  Cypriote  ti  and  a sign  in  the 
throne  column.  He  stuck  with  a for  the  double  ax  and  the  signs  of  that  column, 
and  with  the  help  of  this  made  his  third  consonant  assumption,  n,  because  of 
the  similarity  of  the  Cypriote  na  and  a sign  in  the  -a  column. 

With  these  in  mind,  he  looked  again  at  some  of  the  very  words  that  Miss 
Kober  had  used  in  her  original  analysis.  He  thought  that  certain  of  these 
might  be  names  of  places.  Their  longer  forms  had  added  on  the  symbols 
for  jo  and  ja  to  form  masculine  and  feminine  adjectives,  just  as  “France” 
expands  to  “franqais”  and  “frangaise.”  In  the  words’  short  forms,  all  their 
vowels  were  known.  In  the  first  word,  for  example,  the  grid  showed  that  all 
three  vowels  were  the  same;  the  jo  assumption  made  them  o.  The  consonants 
were  not  known,  but  here  again  the  grid  showed  that,  in  the  first  name  and 
the  second,  the  last  consonants  were  the  same.  Moreover,  the  second  con- 
sonant of  the  first  word  was  the  same  as  the  third  consonant  of  the  second — 
even  though  they  were  mated  to  different  vowels.  The  partial  decipherments, 
in  which  the  unknown  consonants  are  represented  by  the  numbers  of  the  row 
of  the  grid  in  which  the  Minoan  sign  stood,  were: 

60-80- 1 3o  0-7/-8/-1 3o 

Among  the  place-names  likely  to  occur  in  tablets  found  at  Knossos  would 
be  that  of  its  harbor  town,  Amnisos,  which  would  have  to  be  spelled  with  an 
extra  vowel  between  the  m and  the  n to  conform  to  the  consonant-vowel 
nature  of  the  script.  As  Ventris  later  wrote,  “It  did  not  require  very  great 
imagination  to  realize”  that  the  second  of  the  two  could  be  A-mi-ni-so.  If  so, 
the  imperatives  of  the  grid  demanded  that  the  first  name  become  6 o-no-so, 
which,  again  on  the  basis  of  an  inserted  vowel,  could  be  Ko-no-so,  or  Knossos 
itself.  This  looked  good.  Perhaps  the  scribes  dropped  the  final  -.r.  This  might 
explain  the  puzzling  failure  of  the  sign  that  so  resembled  the  Cypriote  se  to 
appear  at  the  end  of  words  as  often  as  it  would  have  in  Greek.  Though  the 
inserted  vowels  differed  in  the  two  cases,  they  both  followed  the  rule  of 
anticipation:  they  were  the  same  as  the  vowel  of  the  following  syllable. 

By  a chain  reaction,  the  grid  now  determined  part  of  the  sounds  of  dozens 


Ancestral  Voices 


931 


of  other  signs  and  the  entire  phonetic  value  of  several  others,  just  as  it  had 
indicated  the  consonant  of  no  in  Ko-no-so.  For  example,  the  sign  like  a tall 
beer  glass  stood  at  the  intersection  of  the  row  for  k and  the  column  for  1.  It 
had  to  be  ki.  That  was  the  beauty  of  the  grid  system.  It  forced  its  decipher- 
ment out  of  itself. 

Ventris  looked  at  the  two-sign  word  that  Miss  Kober  had  determined  stood 
for  “total.”  The  first  sign  stood  in  the  same  row  as  ti  and  in  the  0 column;  it 
had  to  be  to.  The  second  sign  in  the  masculine  form  was  so,  and  the  second 
sign  in  the  feminine  form  stood  in  the  same  row  but  in  the  a column : sa.  Thus 
the  two  words  were  to-so  and  to-sa.  They  strongly  resembled  archaic  forms  of 
the  Greek  tossos  and  tossa,  “so  much,”  or  tossoi  and  tossai,  “so  many. 
Greek  ? Everybody,  including  Ventris,  thought  that  the  Linear  b language  had 
to  resemble  some  Aegean  tongue  that  reflected  the  cultural  domination  of  the 
Cretans,  whose  ethnic  origin  was  widely  regarded  as  non-Greek.  The  occur- 
rence of  an  isolated  word  in  a different  language  would  not  shake  this  view. 
It  would  not  mean  that  Linear  b was  Greek  any  more  than  the  presence  of 
“habeas  corpus”  in  a Supreme  Court  decision  would  mean  that  it  was  written 
in  Latin. 

Borrowed  words  usually  indicate  a need  in  the  borrowing  language. 
Words  for  common,  everyday  things,  on  the  other  hand,  are  usually  filled 
from  the  native  stock.  Consequently  Ventris  may  have  been  a bit  surprised 
when  the  first  syllable  of  the  word  that,  in  masculine  and  feminine  forms,  had 
been  identified  by  ideograms  as  “boys"  and  “girls  deciphered  as^Aro,  the 
beginning  of  the  classical  Greek  “kouros"  (“boy’  ) and  “kore  ( girl  ).  Even 
this  would  not  be  conclusive:  the  English  words  for  such  homely  concepts  as 
“uncle”  and  “sky”  have  been  imposed  by  invaders  and  do  not  come  from 
Anglo-Saxon. 

Then  Ventris  recalled  that  philologists  had  reconstructed  the  primitive 
Greek  forms  of  “koros”  and  “kore”  as  “korwos”  and  “korwa.”  He  thought 
that  these  primitive  forms  might  be  rendered  in  Linear  b as  ko-wo  and  ko-wa, 
and  he  drew  from  the  back  of  his  mind  the  suspicion  that  the  barred  A sign 
represented  the  pure  vowel  e.  This  would  make  -e-wo  part  of  a common 
declension,  and  he  remembered  another  reconstruction:  -ewos,  the  primitive 
Greek  genitive  of  the  many  words  ending  in  -eus,  such  as  the  names  Odys- 
seus,” “Peleus,”  “Idomeneus.”  He  made  further  assumptions— perhaps  just 
in  the  spirit  of  seeing  where  they  would  lead.  These  produced  a whole  phrase 
of  what  appeared  to  be  mutilated  archaic  Greek  from  a table  with  a chariot 
ideogram;  it  translated  as  “fitted  with  reins. 

Greek  had  now  thrust  itself  upon  him  in  vocabulary,  syntax,  and  meaning. 
Always  the  assumptions,  rigidly  controlled  by  the  grid,  mutually  interlocked. 
Could  it  be  that  the  Linear  b tablets  were — contrary  to  every  tenet  of  ortho- 
dox Bronze  Age  archeology— written  in  Greek? 

Ventris  was  not  convinced.  In  Work  Note  20  of  June  1,  1 952,  which  set  out 
these  results,  he  wrote:  “If  pursued,  I suspect  that  this  line  of  decipherment 


932 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


would  sooner  or  later  come  to  an  impasse,  or  dissipate  itself  in  absurdities.” 
He  scrupulously  pointed  out  that  the  button  sign  would  not  fit  the  archaic 
Greek  word  that  scholars  had  reconstructed  for  an  enclitic  “and,”  which  was 
te.  He  called  the  Work  Note  “a  frivolous  digression,”  and  regarded  the  ap- 
pearance of  the  Hellenic  language  as  “the  Greek  chimera.” 

But  while  the  Work  Note  still  was  in  the  mail,  Ventris  discovered  that  the 
chimera  was  astonishingly  real.  He  had  pursued  the  line  of  decipherment  and 
found  that  the  Greek  solution  could  not  be  denied.  His  logic  had  conquered 
his  preconceptions.  He  had  recovered  archaic  forms  of  four  well-known 
Greek  words  (for  “shepherd,”  “potter,”  “goldsmith,”  and  “bronzesmith”) 
and  translated  eight  phrases.  On  a BBC.  broadcast  over  which  he  had 
previously  been  invited  to  give  a talk  on  the  general  problem  of  the  scripts,  he

Michael  Ventris'  grid  of  Linear  b signs 


said,  “Once  1 made  this  assumption  [that  the  tablets  were  written  in  Greek], 
most  of  the  peculiarities  of  the  language  and  spelling  which  had  puzzled  me 
seemed  to  find  a logical  explanation.”  In  June  of  1952,  Ventris  felt  that  he  had 
deciphered  Linear  b.  Work  Note  20  was  the  last. 

One  of  the  most  interested  listeners  to  the  broadcast  was  a young  Cam- 
bridge philologist  specializing  in  Greek,  John  Chadwick.  At  the  time,  the 
Ventris  theory  was  just  the  latest  in  a long  line  of  supposed  “solutions,”  every 
one  of  which  had  failed.  But  Chadwick,  who  had  himself  failed  to  read  the 
tablets  on  the  assumption  that  they  were  Greek,  was  interested.  He  obtained 
Ventris’  Work  Notes  from  Sir  John  Myres  and  went  home  to  test  the  solu- 
tion for  himself.  Within  four  days  he  was  convinced.  He  had  deciphered  23 


Ancestral  Voices 


933 


plausible  Greek  words,  some  of  which  had  not  then  been  read  by  Ventris.  On 
July  9,  Chadwick  wrote  to  the  architect,  congratulating  him  on  the  solution. 
They  formed  a close  association  and  together  wrote  a report  of  the  decipher- 
ment under  a title  which  they  had  carefully  chosen  to  avoid  extravagant 
claims:  “Evidence  for  Greek  Dialect  in  the  Mycenaean  Archives.” 

It  gave  a decidedly  confusing  explanation  of  the  decipherment.  And  it  did 
not  gather  up  all  the  loose  ends.  Some  signs  remained  unknown;  some  trans- 
lation difficulties  arose.  Yet  its  conclusions  were  cogent.  In  the  first  place,  the 
deciphered  words  made  sense.  The  language  was  Greek,  truncated  and  primi- 
tive as  compared  to  the  polished  classical  tongue,  but  Greek.  Its  roughness 
could  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the  language  of  the  tablets  was  a thousand 
years  older  than  that  of  Plato,  “a  difference  in  date,”  they  noted,  “as  great  as 
between  Beowulf  and  Shakespeare.”  Besides,  many  of  the  archaic  forms  agreed 
with  predicted  ones.  In  the  second  place,  the  deciphered  texts  reflected  what 


The  “ tripod ” tablet  that  clinched  the  decipherment  of  Linear  b 


the  tablets  appeared  to  be  talking  about.  Where  the  grid  produced  the  word 
for  “sword,”  a pictogram  of  a sword  stood  nearby.  The  two  young  authors 
submitted  their  article  to  the  editors  of  the  Journal  of  Hellenic  Studies,  who, 
recognizing  its  importance,  made  room  for  it  in  the  1953  volume  despite  the 
backlog  of  World  War  II  articles  that  was  still  crowding  their  pages. 

While  waiting  for  it  to  appear,  Ventris  heard  favorably  from  many  experts 
who  knew  of  his  work.  Professor  Sittig,  for  example,  who  had  been  working 
on  his  own  method  of  decipherment,  now  abandoned  it  and  wrote  to  Ventris 
on  May  22,  1953;  “Your  demonstrations  are  cryptologically  the  most  interest- 
ing I have  yet  heard  of,  and  are  really  fascinating.”  Of  course,  not  everybody 
climbed  on  the  bandwagon.  But  in  that  same  month  Ventris  received  a letter 
from  Blegen  that  settled  the  matter: 

Since  my  return  to  Greece  I have  spent  much  of  my  time  working  on  the 
tablets  from  Pylos,  getting  them  properly  ready  to  be  photographed.  I have  tried 
your  experimental  syllabary  on  some  of  them. 

Enclosed  for  your  information  is  a copy  of  p641  , which  you  may  find  interest- 
ing. It  evidently  deals  with  pots,  some  on  three  legs,  some  with  four  handles, 
some  with  three,  and  others  without  handles.  The  first  word  by  your  system 
seems  to  be  ti-ri-po-de  and  it  recurs  twice  as  ti-ri-po  (singular?).  The  four- 
handled  pot  is  preceded  by  qe-to-ro-we , the  three-handled  by  ti-ri-o-we  or  ti-ri-jo- 
we,  the  handleless  pot  by  a-no-we.  All  this  seems  too  good  to  be  true.  Is  coinci- 
dence excluded? 


934 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


It  was.  The  obvious  relation  of  ti-ri-  to  tri-,  of  a-  to  the  prefix  meaning 
“nothing”  or  “without,”  of  -po-de  to  Greek  root  -pod-  meaning  “foot,”  and 
of  -o-we  to  the  Greek  -oues  for  “ear”  or  “handle”  could  not  be  denied.  The 
language  of  Linear  b was  indubitably  Greek.  The  tripod  tablet  results  brought 
immediate  agreement  in  principle  by  the  vast  majority  of  scholars  competent 
in  the  field — including  many  who  had  themselves  been  defeated  by  the  solu- 
tion, such  as  Georgiev,  Sundwall,  and  Bennett. 

But  some  disagreed.  The  same  journal  that  published  “Evidence”  pro- 
vided space  for  a rebuttal  by  A.  J.  Beattie,  professor  of  Greek  at  the  University 
of  Edinburgh.  He  did  not  understand  the  grid — a misapprehension  that  was 
due  not  to  any  obtuseness  of  his  but  to  the  obscurity  of  the  Ventris-Chadwick 
account.  “Let  us  suppose  that  he  [Ventris]  used  all  the  texts  available  to  him,” 
Beattie  wrote,  “and  that  he  counted  every  single  sign  in  initial,  medial  and 
final  positions,  and  so  obtained  three  figures  and  an  overall  total  for  each 
sign,  as  well  as  an  assortment  of  information  about  alternatives  or  concomi- 
tants. Are  we  then  to  suppose  that  these  figures  fell  naturally  into  groups,  so 
that  the  signs  to  which  they  referred  could  be  disposed  lengthwise  and  cross- 
wise in  such  a way  that  they  would  ultimately  be  found  to  correspond  to 
series  of  the  type,  /,  pi,  ti,  ki,  etc.  and  pa,  pe,  pi,  etc.?  This  is  evidently  what 
Mr.  Ventris  means  us  to  believe.”  This  same  lack  of  understanding  misin- 
formed Beattie’s  more  valid  linguistic  criticisms:  “What  Mr.  Ventris  has 
given  us  by  his  transcription  is  not  in  fact  the  Greek  language  but  a language 
of  his  own  making.  It  is  a strange  language,  which  looks  like  Greek  because 
he  has  been  careful  to  provide  it  with  a selection  of  Greek  suffixes. . . . And 
by  devising  spelling-conventions  of  primitive  simplicity,  he  has  ensured  that 
the  syllables  preceding  the  suffix  of  each  word  may  occasionally  be  intelligible 
as  Greek  word-stems.”  Even  Beattie  admitted  that  the  tripod  tablet  yielded 
some  Greek,  however,  and  in  the  end  was  reduced  to  impugning,  not  the 
results,  but  the  data  itself:  “We  should  in  any  case  suspect  the  validity  of  a 
list  that  has  no  one-handled  or  two-handled  pots  but  knows  only  those  with 
three  or  four  handles  or  none  at  all.” 

Unlike  the  attacks  upon  the  Hrozny  and  Georgiev  “solutions”  of  Linear 
b,  the  critics’  objections  failed  to  convince.  The  solution  rapidly  won  accep- 
tance, and  classical  circles  began  to  use  its  results.  The  most  important  result 
was,  of  course,  the  very  fact  that  the  language  was  Greek.  Greek  was  spoken 
at  the  seat  of  former  Minoan  power  in  Knossos  because  Greeks  ruled  there. 
This  vindicated  Wace’s  rebel  view  that  the  mainland  dominated  Crete  during 
the  questioned  years  of  1400  to  1125  b.c.  and  thereby  revised  the  Late  Bronze 
Age  history  of  the  Aegean. 

But  what  did  the  tablets  say? 

Sample  texts  read  like  this:  “Koldos  the  shepherd  holds  a lease  from  the 
village:  48  litres  of  wheat.”  “At  Pylos:  five  sons  of  the  Ti-nwa-sian  weavers 
(sons  of  rowers  at  A-pu-ne-we),  two  boys.”  “Four  (or  more)  slaves  of  Koradol- 
los  in  charge  of  seed-corn.”  “One  pair  of  wheels  bound  with  bronze,  unfit 


Ancestral  Voices

for  service.”  The  tripod  tablet,  with  pictograms  in  italic  capitals:  “Two 
tripods:  Aigeus  the  Cretan  brings  them:  2 TRIPODS.  One  tripod:  it  is  not 
sound  as  regards  one  foot:  1 TRIPOD.  One  tripod:  the  Cretan  brings  it; 
charred  around  the  legs.  . . 1 TRIPOD.  Wine-jars:  3 JARS.  One  larger  cup 
with  4 handles:  1 CUP.  Two  larger  cups  with  3 handles:  2 CUPS.  One  smaller 
cup  with  4 handles:  1 CUP.  One  smaller  cup  with  3 handles:  1 CUP.  One 
smaller  cup  with  no  handle:  1 CUP."  A votive  tablet  reporting,  “To  all  the 
gods,  one  amphora  of  honey : 1 AMPHORA.  To  the  Mistress  of  the  Labyrinth, 
one  amphora  of  honey : 1 AMPHORA"  reads  in  the  syllabic  script  pa-si-te-o-i 
me-ri  AMPHORA  \\da-pu-ri-to-jo  po-ti-ni-ja  me-ri  AMPHORA  1.” 

None  of  the  tablets  contains  any  literary  work,  nor  any  diplomatic  in- 
structions, personal  letters,  religious  texts,  historical  writings,  nor  anything, 
in  fact,  beside  these  minutely  detailed  bureaucratic  records  of  petty  com- 
mercial transactions.  Professor  Denys  Page  describes  the  impression  they 
make  as  a whole : 

These  palace  archives  are  the  records  of  a comprehensive  and  pervasive 
bureaucracy,  administering  for  hundreds  of  years  a most  elaborately  organized 
society.  ...  It  is  as  if  everything  done  by  everybody  was  open  to  official  inquiry 
and  subject  to  official  orders.  We  possess  a part  only  of  the  archives  for  a single 
year  at  Pylos : they  record  thousands  of  transactions  in  hundreds  of  places.  . . . 
But  even  more  astonishing  and  significant  is  the  omniscience,  the  insatiable 
thirst  for  intimate  detail.  Sheep  may  be  counted  up  to  a glittering  total  of  twenty- 
five  thousand;  but  there  is  still  a purpose  to  be  served  by  recording  the  fact  that 
one  animal  was  contributed  by  Komawens  and  another  by  E-te-wa-no.  Restless 
officialdom  notes  the  presence  in  Pe-se-ro' s house  of  one  woman  and  two 
children;  the  employment  of  two  nurses,  one  girl,  and  one  boy,  in  a Cretan  vil- 
lage; the  fattening  of  an  insignificant  number  of  hogs  in  nine  places;  the  exis- 
tence somewhere  of  a single  pair  of  brassbound  chariot  wheels  and  labelled 
“useless”.  . . . One  would  suppose  that  not  a seed  could  be  sown,  not  a gram  of 
bronze  worked,  not  a cloth  woven,  not  a goat  reared  or  a hog  fattened,  without 
the  filling  of  a form  in  the  Royal  Palace;  such  is  the  impression  made  by  only 
part  of  the  files  for  a single  year. 

But  was  this  all?  Was  this  piddling  minutiae  to  be  the  only  result  of  a 
brilliant  achievement?  Was  there  to  be  no  Epic  of  Gilgamesh,  no  Code  of 
Hammurabi,  no  pharaonic  boasts  of  kings  conquered  and  cities  sacked— 
only  the  Bronze  Age  equivalent  of  some  incomplete  county  clerk  records, 
some  transactions  of  a farm  cooperative,  and  some  small  donations  to  a 
parish  church?  Only  that.  But  although  no  poetry  has  been  discovered,  the 
information  contained  in  the  tablets  has,  by  inference,  illuminated  some  of 
the  greatest  of  Western  man’s  poetry — the  Iliad  and  the  Odyssey. 

The  tablets  do  so  because  they  are  400  years  older  than  the  time  of  Homer 
and  contemporary  with  the  events  of  which  he  sings.  Linear  b represents  the 
written  form  of  the  language  spoken  by  the  almost  legendary  figures  of  the 
Trojan  War.  The  clay  tablets  found  at  Mycenae  and  Pylos  were  written  at 


936 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


almost  the  very  moment  that  Agamemnon  and  Nestor,  the  kings  of  those 
cities,  were  waging  war  on  the  Trojan  plain.  Soon  thereafter,  waves  of  im- 
poverished and  barbaric  Dorians  from  the  north,  brandishing  their  iron 
weapons,  overran  the  Bronze  Age  civilization  of  heroic  Greece.  They  ex- 
tinguished the  light  of  learning  and  the  love  of  art,  and  for  four  centuries 
Greece  dwelled  in  the  illiterate  darkness  of  its  early  Iron  Age.  In  the  eighth 
century  b.c.  the  Hellenes  began  to  emerge  from  this  eclipse.  They  started  to 
write  with  the  Phoenician  alphabet — the  precursor  of  the  present  Latin 
alphabet.  At  the  same  time,  a blind  genius  molded  the  stories  of  gods  and  men 
that  had  been  transmitted  orally  from  the  past  into  a great  unified  theme  and 
won  undying  fame  for  his  name — Homer.  The  names  and  noble  deeds  and 
language  of  his  epics  in  turn  helped  fix  the  ideals  of  the  classical  Greek  civiliza- 
tion that  flowered  a few  centuries  later,  and  so  helped  mold  the  West. 

By  preserving  many  circumstantial  details  of  the  heroic  world,  the  Linear 
b tablets  assist  in  showing  to  what  extent  the  Iliad  is  historical,  to  what 
extent  poetic  imagination  has  transmuted  factual  dross  to  fictional  gold. 
Basically,  the  tablets  confirm  what  archeology — beginning  with  Schliemann 
— had  already  shown,  but  they  do  provide  additional  details.  For  example, 
the  tablets  have  two  high  titles  in  common  with  the  epics:  “wanax”  and 
“basileus.”  In  the  tablets,  “wanax”  referred  to  the  supreme  king  in  the 
palace,  and  “basileus”  to  one  of  the  many  district  governors.  The  epics 
often  confer  the  title  “basileus”  on  men  who  were  clearly  “wanaktes,” 
showing  a generalization  of  the  term.  But  subconsciously  the  poet  knows  that 
the  inferior  title  of  “basileus”  may  never  be  applied  to  a god,  though  he  may 
with  perfect  propriety  be  called  “wanax.”  “The  existence  of  the  title  ‘wanax’ 
in  the  Iliad  is  a plain  proof  of  the  continuity  of  the  Greek  epic  from  the 
Mycenaean  period  onwards,”  wrote  Denys  Page.  Another  proof  of  the  his- 
toricity of  the  Iliad  lies  in  the  many  names  in  -eus  that  occur  in  both  the 
tablets  and  the  epics — but  not  in  later  Greece.  Dorian  names  were  different, 
and,  since  the  Mycenaean  names  survived  only  because  the  stories  did,  they 
testify  to  the  fact  that  the  Siege  of  Troy  was  already  the  subject  of  oral 
poetry  within  a generation  of  the  destruction  of  the  historical  city,  Troy  VII. 

Before  Ventris  deciphered  Linear  b,  the  oldest  known  specimen  of  Greek 
(and  hence  of  European)  writing  existed  on  a vase  dating  from  about  750 
B.c.;  it  reads,  "The  dancer  who  performs  most  gracefully  of  all  shall  receive 
this.”  Ventris  pushed  back  the  frontiers  of  the  language  by  some  700  years.  He 
disinterred  the  earliest  form  of  a language  that  still  lives,  32  centuries  later, 
and  one  of  the  earliest  known  forms  of  the  western  branch  of  the  Indo- 
European  languages.  This  has  filled  in  some  details  of  linguistic  and  semantic 
change. 

Similarly,  the  Linear  b tablets  help  depict  life  in  Bronze  Age  Greece,  and 
so  throw  additional  light  upon  these  obscure  origins  of  Greek  history.  As 
Professor  T.  B.  L.  Webster  declared,  “By  seeing  the  Greeks  against  this  back- 
ground we  can  measure  more  clearly  than  ever  before  the  achievement  of  the 


Ancestral  Voices 


937 


Greeks  in  leaping  out  of  this  context  to  become  the  founders  of  modern 
civilization.” 

Yet  these  results  are,  in  the  broadest  sense,  limited.  They  provide  some 
minor  details  for  literary  appreciation;  they  permit  a slightly  greater  under- 
standing of  a brilliant  cultural  achievement;  they  rectify  an  upside-down 
picture  of  the  relation  between  two  neighboring  areas  during  a brief  and  dis- 
tant moment  of  time,  without  much  altering  the  view  of  the  inner  life  of  those 
areas.  It  is  true  that  no  decipherment  can  ever  have  the  impact  upon  man  that 
a new  scientific  discovery  can,  although  the  one  may  equal  the  other  as  a 
mental  accomplishment.  But  even  on  its  own  ground  of  historical  importance, 
the  decipherment  of  Linear  b cannot  match  that  of  hieroglyphic  or  that  of 
cuneiform.  They  painted  whole  civilizations  in  rich  detail  on  large  and  color- 
ful canvases.  Linear  b slightly  embellished  one  already  known.  William  H. 
McNeill,  in  his  recent  one-volume  world  history,  relegated  the  results  to  a 
footnote. 

The  greatness  of  the  decipherment  lies  not  in  its  substance  but  in  its 
method.  It  shines  with  a clean  Euclidean  beauty.  In  it,  man  thinks  more 
purely  rationally,  depending  less  upon  external  information  and  more 
upon  logical  manipulation  of  the  data  to  derive  new  conclusions,  than  per- 
haps anywhere  else  in  the  humanities.  The  foundations  of  the  decipherment 
utilized  almost  exclusively  the  observable  interrelationships  of  the  script 
symbols.  The  decipherers  subjected  these  relationships  to  a minute  scrutiny 
and,  on  the  basis  of  only  a few  simple  hypotheses  from  philology,  extracted  a 
pattern  of  vowels  and  consonants  and  then  rewove  them  into  a meaningful 
whole.  The  decipherment  was  sufficient  unto  itself.  Everything  discovered  in 
the  analysis  found  its  place  in  the  synthesis.  From  this  economy  and  sim- 
plicity the  decipherment  gains  its  elegance  and  its  great  sense  of  satisfaction. 
And  when,  in  the  phonetic  breakthrough,  the  decipherer  necessarily  departed 
from  the  givens  of  the  script,  he  borrowed  the  very  minimum  of  information 
from  the  outside  world.  He  needed  no  bilingual  Rosetta  Stone,  no  dusty 
chronicles  of  Persian  kings — only  the  single  inescapable  fact  of  where  the 
tablets  had  been  found. 

The  decipherment's  pattern,  more  valuable  than  the  information  it  pro- 
duced, gives  the  work  its  great  vitality — a vitality  that  has  overcome  the 
human  mortality  of  its  decipherers.  For  Ventris,  like  Alice  Kober,  had  died 
young.  Aged  34,  he  collided  with  a truck  near  Hatfield,  England,  while 
driving  home  late  one  night.  But  though  all  men  die,  to  few  is  it  given  even 
in  the  full  span  of  human  existence  to  produce  some  useful  work  that  endures 
beyond  their  years  and  makes  them  immortal.  Michael  Ventris  and  Alice 
Kober,  despite  their  premature  deaths,  won  that  victory.  They  created  the 
model  decipherment.

MESSAGES  FROM  OUTER  SPACE 


of  all  the  problems  challenging  man  in  the  modern  realms  of 
space  and  communication,  perhaps  the  most  intriguing  is  the  one  that  lies  at 
their  juncture:  how  to  solve  messages  from  other  worlds.  The  detection  of  a 
communication  from  another  planet  in  another  solar  system  would  be  one 
of  the  greatest  events  in  human  history.  The  discovery  that  other  beings 
inhabit  the  same  corner  of  eternity  as  man,  that  “they”  are  out  there  and  “we” 
are  down  here,  that  life  is  not  only  an  earthly  state  of  being,  that  man  must 
now  surrender  his  last  claim  to  uniqueness  in  the  universe,  would  profoundly 
affect  human  thought.  At  the  same  time,  it  would  open  unimaginable  vistas 
of  technological  growth  that  might  help  men  solve  the  problems  of  war, 
disease,  hunger.  This  would  require  an  exchange  of  information,  something 
beyond  the  mere  hearing  of  a signal  from  outer  space. 

Yet,  paradoxically,  the  very  dissimilarities  that  would  make  the  transfer 
of  knowledge  so  fruitful  might  impede  it.  Could  man  understand  a message 
from  beings  whose  very  modes  of  consciousness  might  differ  from  his?  Could 
he  extract  information  sent  by  creatures  whose  experience  might  seem  at  first 
glance  to  be  utterly  remote  from  his,  who  might  not  even  respond  to  the 
same  sense  stimuli  as  humans,  whose  ways  of  thought  might  be  as  different 
from  man’s  as  man’s  are  from  the  ant’s?  No  doubt  men  would  try,  as  Ulysses 
tried, 

To  follow  knowledge,  like  a sinking  star, 

Beyond  the  utmost  bound  of  human  thought. 

But  could  they  do  it? 

The  problem  is  not  merely  academic.  Before  dawn  on  the  clear,  cold  morn- 
ing of  April  8,  1960,  a young  radio  astronomer,  Dr.  Frank  D.  Drake,  and 
a handful  of  technicians  arrived  in  the  electronics-packed  control  room 
nestling  beneath  the  85-foot  radio  telescope  that  stands  in  a grassy  meadow  at 
tiny  Green  Bank,  West  Virginia.  They  aimed  its  parabolic  dish  at  Tau  Ceti,  an 
average-sized  nearby  star  in  the  constellation  of  the  Whale  that  was  then  rising 
over  the  eastern  rim  of  the  mountainous  horizon.  They  set  clockwork  to  track 
the  star  as  it  moved  across  the  vault  of  the  sky.  Drake  turned  on  the  loud- 
speaker that  would  bring  into  the  control  room  the  radio  emanations  that 
the  radio  telescope — which  is  basically  a giant  directional  radio  antenna —

would  pick  up.  He  started  the  recording  device  whose  pen  would  trace  the 
emanations  on  a moving  strip  of  paper.  At  about  6 a.m.,  he  reached  the  last 
switch  in  his  long  series — the  one  for  the  mechanism  that  would  automatically 
tune  the  receiver  to  listen  in  to  one  radio  frequency  after  another.  With  a 
certain  sense  of  destiny,  he  flicked  it. 

Mankind  had  begun  the  first  major  search  that  could  lead  to  perhaps  the 
most  important  discovery  in  its  history — messages  from  outer  space. 

Two  years  later,  in  the  dimly  lit  caucus  room  of  the  House  of  Representa- 
tives, Emilio  Q.  Daddario,  a Congressman  from  Connecticut  who,  like  most 
of  his  colleagues,  is  usually  concerned  with  much  more  down-to-earth  prob- 
lems, put  a question  that  might  have  seemed  to  belong,  not  to  the  august  halls 
of  Congress,  but  to  science  fiction,  cereal  boxes,  comic  strips,  or  teenage 
speculations.  “I  wonder,”  he  asked  the  distinguished  British  astronomer  Dr. 
Bernard  Lovell,  “taking  into  consideration  the  status  of  all  of  the  possibilities 
of  planets  including  those  which  might  have  life  of  one  kind  or  another,  what 
are  the  possibilities  of  receiving  signals  from  other  planets,  and  what  kind  of 
program  should  we  have  if  any,  and  what  would  it  involve?”  Ten  years 
earlier,  such  a question  would  have  made  Daddario  the  butt  of  laughter  and 
might  even  have  cost  him  some  votes  back  home.  On  March  21,  1962,  nobody 
laughed,  and  the  question  got  a serious  answer:  “Well,  sir,  I think  that  now 
one  has  to  be  sympathetic  about  an  idea  which  only  a few  years  ago  would 
have  seemed  rather  farfetched.”  And  then  the  Congressmen  and  the  scientists 
went  on  to  discuss  that  idea. 

Just  a few  months  earlier,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  had  spon- 
sored a conference  at  Green  Bank,  at  which  1 1 scientists  explored  in  some 
depth  the  questions  of  extraterrestrial  life  and  its  detection.  And  by  1965, 
some  scientists  had  grown  so  trigger-happy  over  the  possibility  of  hearing 
messages  from  outer  space  that  three  Russian  astronomers  announced  that 
they  had  heard  radio  waves  on  a 100-day  cycle  from  quasar  CTA-102  indicat- 
ing a supercivilization — only  to  retract  it,  after  an  almost  unanimous  chorus 
of  skepticism,  the  very  next  day. 

Men  have  long  wondered  whether  other  beings  exist  elsewhere  in  the  uni- 
verse. Lucretius  thought  it  “in  the  highest  degree  unlikely  that  this  earth  and 
sky  is  the  only  one  to  have  been  created.”  A Chinese  philosopher,  Teng  Mu, 
thought  along  the  same  lines,  and  Plutarch  wondered  about  the  habitability  of 
the  moon.  But  for  centuries  Ptolemaic  astronomy,  with  its  earth  at  the  center 
of  its  universe,  precluded  any  such  thoughts  from  being  any  more  than  idle 
speculation.  Then  the  Copernican  revolution  broke  through  the  Ptolemaic 
spheres,  and  the  Newtonian  discovery  of  the  laws  of  gravitation,  which  tie 
together  the  earth  and  the  most  distant  stars,  proposed  to  men’s  minds  the 
new  thought  that  nature  might  behave  in  the  same  way  throughout  the 
universe,  that  celestial  phenomena  might  follow  the  same  laws  as  terrestrial. 

Soon  thereafter  a number  of  scientists  and  philosophers  expressed  the  idea 


940 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


that  there  might  be  a plurality  of  worlds.  Christiaan  Huygens,  discoverer  of  the 
rings  of  Saturn,  looked  up  at  the  starry  heavens  and  wondered,  “Why  may 
not  every  one  of  these  stars  or  suns  have  as  great  a retinue  as  our  sun,  of  planets, 
with  their  moons  to  wait  upon  them?”  Bishop  John  Wilkins,  author  of  the 
first  book  on  cryptology  in  English,  published  The  Discovery  of  a World  in  the 
Moone,  or  a Discourse  tending  to  prove  that  ’ tis  probable  there  may  be  another 
Habitable  World  in  the  Planet.  Poets  found  these  ideas  a fertile  ground  for 
fancy.  Milton  wondered  in  Paradise  Lost  whether  the  moon  might  not  have 
clouds  and  rain  and  also  fruits  and  creatures  to  eat  them.  He  contended  that 
it  was  disputable  whether  the  entire  universe  existed  only  to  convey  shards  of 
starlight  to  the  earth,  but  ended  by  urging  Adam  and  Eve  to  “Dream  not  of 
other  worlds,  what  creatures  there  / Live,  in  what  state,  condition  or  degree,” 
but  to  be  happy  in  Eden.  Alexander  Pope  thought  that  any  knowledge  of 
“what  other  planets  circle  other  suns”  might  help  man  to  know  himself  better. 
A number  of  writers  of  early  science  fiction  discussed  the  question  of  life  on 
other  planets. 

But  for  centuries  such  speculations  were  sanctioned  only  by  imagination. 
Mankind’s  anthropocentric  philosophy  and  religion  even  frowned  upon  them. 
Science  turned  up  no  evidence  for  the  possible  existence  of  other  solar  systems, 
and  the  more  it  learned  about  this  one,  the  less  hospitable  other  planets 
appeared  as  cradles  of  life.  Mercury  was  too  hot,  Jupiter  and  Saturn  and  the 
other  outer  planets  too  cold.  Venus  and  Mars,  on  the  other  hand,  emerged  as 
possibilities.  Then,  in  1877,  the  Italian  astronomer  Giovanni  Schiaparelli 
“discovered"  the  so-called  canals  of  Mars.  Their  ruled-line  precision  seemed 
best  explainable  as  the  work  of  intelligent  beings.  Other  astronomers,  equally 
respectable,  confirmed  the  canals  and  reinforced  the  implication  that  the  red 
planet  could  support  life  by  their  observation  of  the  darkening  of  certain 
areas  during  Martian  springs,  as  if  vegetation  were  growing.  These  ideas 
caught  the  public  fancy,  and  from  these  few  threads  of  evidence  Sunday  sup- 
plement writers  wove  entire  tapestries  of  Martian  biology  and  sociology. 

Interest  in  the  problem  periodically  rose  to  a peak  whenever  Mars  ap- 
proached Earth  closely  in  their  orbits,  which  occurred  every  15  to  17  years. 
Men  animatedly  discussed  whether  the  Martians  might  be  trying  to  contact 
Earth,  and  a few  attempts  were  actually  made  to  detect  any  signals.  But 
nothing  was  heard,  and  the  progress  of  scientific  research  soon  made  it  highly 
improbable  that  any  kind  of  intelligent  life  could  exist  on  Mars.  It  was  too 
cold,  and  there  was  too  little  water.  Continued  astronomical  observations 
reduced  the  “canals”  to  a few  faint  lines  on  the  Martian  surface.  As  for 
Venus,  its  cloud-covered  surface  seemed  to  preclude  gaining  any  visual 
evidence  of  life  there. 

At  the  same  time,  science  seemed  to  have  decided  that  life,  if  it  existed  at 
all  elsewhere  in  the  universe,  was  extremely  rare.  The  birth  of  the  solar  system 
apparently  required  a freak  occurrence.  In  the  immeasurable  depths  of  the 
void — where,  if  the  sun  were  an  apple  placed  at  New  York,  the  nearest  star 


941 


Messages  from  Outer  Space 

would  be  another  apple  at  Moscow — two  stars  approached  one  another  and 
swung  past,  each  drawing  out  of  the  other  long  filaments  of  gas  that  con- 
densed into  planets.  Anyone  who  has  ever  tried  to  get  a golf  ball  into  a 
stationary  hole  a few  hundred  yards  away  will  appreciate  the  difficulty  of  in- 
tionally  getting  the  two  “apples,”  both  in  motion,  to  hit  each  other,  and  much 
more  the  chance  of  their  accidentally  grazing  one  another  while  on  random 
courses.  So  infrequently  would  this  event  have  occurred  that  in  the  whole 
history  of  the  universe  only  the  sparsest  sprinkling  of  planetary  systems  would 
have  come  into  being.  The  probability  of  other  life  in  the  universe  would 
consequently  be  so  low  as  to  be  negligible. 

Theories  were  propounded  that  the  solar  system  might  have  formed  out  of 
a great  whirling  mass  of  gas,  floating  in  the  universe,  that  condensed  under 
gravitational  attraction  into  the  sun  and  its  satellites.  This  ran  into  the  prob- 
lem that  the  sun’s  gravitation  would  apparently  prevent  the  formation  of 
planets.  Though  this  difficulty  still  plagues  cosmologists,  the  collision  theory 
began  to  encounter  even  greater  inconsistencies,  such  as  the  presence  of  an 
iron  core  in  the  earth  when  the  sun,  from  which  the  earth  was  putatively 
born  in  the  cosmic  accident,  has  so  little  of  that  element.  As  a result,  the  con- 
densation theory  came  to  be  accepted  more  and  more  by  astrophysicists. 
Moreover,  external  evidence  tends  to  support  it,  such  as  observations  of  what 
appear  to  be  stars  forming  by  condensation  elsewhere  in  the  universe. 

The  great  implication  of  the  condensation  theory  is  that  planetary  systems 
must  come  into  existence  almost  routinely  as  a by-product  of  the  gaseous  con- 
traction and  swirling  that  produce  stars,  and  that  a fair  proportion  of  stars 
must  have  them.  Evidence  exists  that  this  is  so.  Stars  with  planetary  systems 
rotate  much  more  slowly  than  those  without,  because  the  planets  carry  much 
of  the  system’s  spin,  or  angular  momentum.  Observation  of  many  stars 
shows  a sharp  difference  in  their  rotation  speeds — some  spinning  on  their 
axis  in  a matter  of  hours,  others,  like  the  sun,  taking  25  days  for  a single 
revolution.  Furthermore,  all  stars  above  a certain  temperature  and  mass  spin 
rapidly,  while  all  those  below  spin  slowly.  Astronomers  know  how  many 
stars  exist  of  each  of  type,  and  this  tells  them  that  the  Earth’s  galaxy  alone, 
the  Milky  Way,  contains  millions  of  slowly  spinning  stars.  Almost  certainly 
these  stars  have  planets.  The  pendulum  of  scientific  opinion  had  begun  its 
swing  away  from  the  theory  of  a scarcity  of  life  in  the  universe  toward  one  of 
its  prevalence. 

More  direct  evidence  that  planets  exist  elsewhere — though  none  have  yet 
been  seen — has  been  accumulating  since  World  War  II.  If  sufficiently  heavy, 
a planet  orbiting  a star  will  tug  sufficiently  at  its  parent  star  to  make  it  wiggle 
in  its  motion  across  the  celestial  sphere.  This  wiggle  has  been  observed  in  two 
stars,  61  Cygni  and  Barnard’s  star.  Calculations  indicate  that  the  satellite  of 
61  Cygni  is  about  eight  times  the  mass  of  Jupiter  and  that  it  circles  its  parent 
body  every  4.8  years.  That  of  Barnard’s  star  revolves  in  a 24-year  orbit  and  is 
half  again  as  big  as  Jupiter. 


942 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


It  thus  began  to  appear  that  planetary  systems  are  not  unusual  but  com- 
mon in  the  universe.  Of  course,  only  those  fulfilling  certain  conditions  would 
be  suitable  as  abodes  of  life.  The  main  conditions  appear  to  be  a parent  star- 
long-lived  and  stable  enough  to  permit  the  emergence  of  life,  a planet  large 
enough  to  retain  an  oxygen  atmosphere,  and  an  orbit  that  stays  within  a 
“habitable  zone,”  defined  basically  as  a zone  in  which  water  remains  liquid. 
But  even  when,  from  the  number  of  stars  that  probably  have  planets,  those 
that  are  not  suitable  for  one  reason  or  another  to  support  life  are  successively 
eliminated,  the  quantity  of  stars  in  just  the  Milky  Way  galaxy  is  so  immense 
that  there  still  remain  hundreds  of  thousands  of  potential  life-bearing  worlds. 

While  astronomers  were  coming  to  these  conclusions,  biologists  were 
experimenting  to  show  that  the  chance  of  life’s  arising  on  these  planets  was 
good.  Their  work  actually  began  in  1828  when  Friedrich  Wohler  synthesized 
an  organic  compound,  urea,  found  in  living  creatures,  from  inorganic 
elements.  The  biggest  step  was  Darwin’s,  of  course,  in  advancing  the  theory  of 
evolution  that  showed  a continuous  development  of  life  forms,  from  the  sim- 
plest to  the  most  complex.  There  remained  the  problem  of  how  it  all  started. 
Darwin  himself  thought  that  a few  stray  molecules  containing  the  critical 
elements  of  hydrogen,  oxygen,  carbon,  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus,  cooked  in 
the  warm  seas  of  the  primordial  earth,  jolted  by  discharges  of  electricity, 
might  have  prepared  a compound  “ready  to  undergo  still  more  complex 
changes.”  Serious  testing  of  this  hypothesis  did  not  come  until  the  late  1950s 
and  early  1960s.  In  perhaps  the  most  famous  experiment,  Dr.  Stanley  L. 
Miller  subjected  a mixture  of  water  vapor,  methane,  ammonia,  and  hydrogen 
— thought  to  be,  on  the  basis  of  spectrographic  analysis  of  the  atmospheres 
of  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  main  constituents  of  the  Earth’s  early  atmosphere — 
to  a 60,000-volt  spark.  He  circulated  the  mixture  in  a sealed  system  of  flasks 
and  tubes  for  a week.  By  the  end  of  the  first  day  it  had  turned  pink,  and  by 
the  end  of  the  week  a deep  red.  Upon  analysis,  the  mixture  proved  to  have 
converted  its  simple  compounds  into  glycine,  alanine,  lactic  acid,  acetic 
acid  (vinegar),  urea,  and  formic  acid.  All  are  organic  compounds  of  impor- 
tance in  life,  particularly  glycine  and  alanine,  which,  as  amino  acids,  consti- 
tute proteins,  perhaps  the  most  important  biological  materials. 

At  the  same  time,  other  scientists  were  working  out  the  so-called  “code  of 
life”  of  the  nucleic  acids,  DNA  (deoxyribonucleic  acid)  and  RNA  (ribo- 
nucleic acid).  These  giant  molecules  are  composed  of  a few  simple  chemical 
compounds,  including  amino  acids  like  those  synthesized  by  Miller,  only  re- 
peated hundreds  of  thousands  of  times  in  a complicated  pattern.  Their  struc- 
ture resembles  a twisted  ladder  whose  sidepieces  form  a double  spiral;  the 
molecule  unzips  down  the  rungs  to  form  two  separate  semimolecules,  each 
of  which  attaches  to  itself  compounds  floating  in  the  environment — thereby 
twice  re-creating  the  ladder  and  reproducing  the  original  molecule.  The  pat- 
tern with  which  the  compounds  of  these  nucleic  acids  fit  together — a pattern 
that  differs  from  one  animal  species  to  another — carries  the  instructions  of

heredity.  Thus  DNA  and  RNA  are  responsible  for  the  essential  characteristic 
of  life:  its  ability  to  persist,  its  continuity.  They  themselves  lie  at  the  border 
between  the  animate  and  the  inanimate.  These  biological  experiments  tended 
to  show  that  life  could  arise  spontaneously  from  ordinary,  nonliving  chemical 
compounds  present  on  the  primitive  Earth.  And  if  it  could  happen  on  that 
typical  planet,  Earth,  it  could  happen  on  others. 

Thus  astronomy  and  biology  converged  upon  the  likelihood  that  life 
exists  elsewhere  in  the  universe.  Man  is  just  now  reaching  that  conclusion. 
But  the  galactic  time-scale  reduces  to  the  blink  of  a gnat’s  eye  man’s  existence 
on  Earth.  Consequently,  it  is  unlikely  that  other  forms  of  life  elsewhere  have 
evolved  to  precisely  the  same  point  of  cosmic  consciousness.  Chance  alone 
would  predict  that  on  half  the  other  planets  life  might  be  still  in  the  uni- 
cellular state  or  in  their  equivalent  of  Neanderthal  man.  But  on  the  other 
half  civilization  might  have  soared  far  beyond  Earth’s  still  primitive 
efforts.  ' ' ’ • * 

In  1959,  as  all  these  avenues  of  investigation  were  reaching  the  crossroads 
that  meant  life  exists  elsewhere,  a question  asserted  itself  to  several  minds  at 
almost  the  same  time.  Might  these  superior  civilizations  be  trying  to  contact 
us?  Frank  Drake  was  beginning  the  thinking  that  culminated  in  Project 
Ozma.  And  two  physicists  from  Cornell,  who  had  long  been  interested  in  the 
general  question  of  life  in  outer  space,  finally  spent  a few  days  to  see  whether 
communication  was  feasible  between  different  solar  systems.  Their  calcula- 
tions showed  that  it  was,  and  they  sent  the  report  of  their  investigations  to 
Nature,  the  prestigious  British  scientific  weekly.  Its  publication  of  their  paper 
on  September  19,  1961,  made  discussion  of  this  science-fiction  question 
“respectable,”  brought  it  out  into  the  open,  and  stimulated  a vigorous  col- 
loquy among  scientists  that  is  still  continuing. 

The  article,  by  Philip  Morrison  and  Giuseppe  Cocconi,  was  entitled 
“Searching  for  Interstellar  Communications.”  After  briefly  recapitulating  the 
likelihood  that  long-lived  civilizations  might  arise  in  other  solar  systems,  they 
said : 

It  follows,  then,  that  near  some  star  rather  like  the  Sun  there  are  civilizations 
with  scientific  interests  and  with  technical  possibilities  much  greater  than  those 
now  available  to  us. 

To  the  beings  of  such  a society,  our  Sun  must  appear  as  a likely  site  for  the 
evolution  of  a new  society.  It  is  highly  probable  that  for  a long  time  they  will 
have  been  expecting  the  development  of  science  near  the  Sun.  We  shall  assume 
that  long  ago  they  established  a channel  of  communication  that  would  one  day 
become  known  to  us,  and  that  they  look  forward  patiently  to  the  answering 
signals  from  the  Sun  which  would  make  known  to  them  that  a new  society  has 
entered  the  community  of  intelligence.  What  sort  of  channel  would  it  be? 

Communication  may  be  effected  in  two  ways:  in  person,  which  is  to  say 
by  direct  face-to-face  contact,  and  not  in  person,  which  is  by  writing,  radio, 
telegraph,  telephone,  flashing  lights,  or  other  similar  long-distance  means. 


944  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

Communication  in  person  is  far  easier  than  not  in  person,  for  it  has  access  to 
many  more  resources. 

Probably  the  first  problem  of  a spaceman  on  another  planet  would  be  to 
decide  whether  the  three-headed  monster  that  meets  him  is  trying  to  signal 
“Welcome,  earthling”  or  “Scram,  one-head!”  If  this  question  is  settled 
amicably,  both  sides  could  proceed  to  the  setting  up  of  a more  extended  com- 
munication. As  a preliminary  step,  the  spaceman  would  obviously  have  to 
determine  which  of  his  five  senses  could  be  used  to  “talk”  to  a creature  that 
may  have  only  some  of  them. 

Smell  seems  useless.  Roy  Bedichek,  in  The  Sense  of  Smell,  tells  why: 

It  may  be  worth  a pause  here  to  consider  the  problem  of  producing  a lan- 
guage— that  is,  a give  and  take  of  important  information — by  means  of  odors 
alone.  There  is  first  the  chemical  difficulty  of  creating  a countless  number  of  dis- 
tinctive odors.  Only  perfumers,  perhaps,  can  appreciate  the  unreasonableness  of 
this  demand.  Solve  it,  however,  and  you  have  made  hardly  a beginning.  Each 
species  must  have  a broadcasting  equipment  competent  on  the  instant  to  generate 
the  odor  molecules  carrying  the  particular  message  the  animal  at  the  moment 
wishes  to  communicate.  After  this  seemingly  impossible  task  has  been  accom- 
plished, there  remains  the  technology  of  devising  a receiving  set  of  high  selectivity 
to  receive  the  broadcast,  decodify  it  and  pass  it  on  to  the  power  with  authority  to 
prescribe  and  enforce  appropriate  action. 

The  other  chemical  sense,  taste,  suffers  from  these  defects  and  more:  taste 
organs  can  respond  only  to  substances  that  they  contact  and  that  are  dis- 
solved in  water. 

Touch,  however,  has  served  humans  as  a relatively  useful  means  of  expres- 
sion. Perhaps  the  most  dramatic  example  is  Helen  Keller.  Blind  and  deaf 
since  the  age  of  nineteen  months,  she  learned  by  matching  the  vibrations  of 
her  teacher’s  vocal  cords  to  objects  she  felt  with  her  hands.  Eventually  she 
managed  to  comprehend,  speak,  and  write.  Though  this  system  depends  upon 
the  peculiar  accessibility  of  the  human  larynx,  its  remarkable  success  in  the 
face  of  severe  obstacles  suggests  that  the  basic  method  may  be  adapted  to 
conversations  with  Martians— meaning  here  the  inhabitants  of  any  other  planet. 
Perhaps  the  spaceman  could  give  an  object  to  the  Martian  and  let  him  first 
feel  it  with  his  antennae,  then  run  those  antennae  over  the  Braille  word  for  the 
object.  Or,  while  the  Martian  is  handling  the  object,  the  spaceman  might 
send  him  the  signal  for  the  object  in  “vibratese,”  an  experimental  system  of 
tactile  communication  by  buzzes  of  different  intensity  and  length  applied 
to  various  parts  of  the  body.  But  touch  itself  is  hampered  by  its  relative 
grossness  and  its  need  to  physically  contact  the  communicator.  These  serious 
limitations  will  probably  relegate  it  to  a subordinate  role  in  man-to-Martian 
communication,  just  as  on  Earth. 

Sight  and  hearing,  then,  are  left  as  the  most  workable  senses  for  conversa- 
tions involving  humans.  With  these  two,  communication  would  probably 
begin  with  a simple  show-and-tell  process,  like  that  used  in  many  schools  to

Messages  from  Outer  Space 

teach  reading.  The  spaceman  could  pick  up  a rock  and  say  “rock,”  could  run 
a short  distance  and  say  “run,”  and  so  forth.  Eventually  communication 
might  be  established.  But  if  the  Martians — or  any  life  forms  on  nearby 
planets,  if  such  exist — are  a subhuman  species,  communication,  in  the  sense 
of  a two-way  exchange  with  men,  would  probably  not  be  possible.  These 
lower  forms  would  not  have  the  intelligence  for  it.  Men  might,  however, 
observe  their  communications  among  themselves.  This  usually  amounts  to  an 
instinctual  behavior  highly  restricted  in  the  information  that  it  conveys.  Such, 
for  example,  is  the  “language”  of  the  bees.  The  German  zoologist  Dr.  Karl  von 
Frisch  found  that  when  a bee  arrived  at  her  hive  laden  with  nectar,  she  would 
perform  a sort  of  “dance”  with  great  vigor.  Suddenly  one  of  the  other  bees 
would  fly  out  of  the  hive.  Others  would  follow.  Within  minutes  some  of  these 
bees  would  appear  at  the  source  of  the  nectar,  which  was  often  some  distance 
away  and  not  visible  from  the  hive.  Through  repeated  experiments,  von  Frisch 
found  that  the  rate  at  which  the  bee  turned  during  her  dance  indicated  the 
distance  of  the  food  source  from  the  hive.  When  the  food  was  only  100  yards 
away,  the  bee  turned  between  nine  and  ten  times  in  15  seconds.  At  200  yards, 
she  turned  seven  times,  and  at  about  a mile,  only  twice.  Her  dance  then  pin- 
pointed the  food  source  by  giving  its  direction  from  the  hive.  When  she 
danced  at  an  angle  of,  say,  fifty  degrees  to  the  left  of  vertical  on  the  hive  wall, 
the  food  source  was  located  fifty  degrees  to  the  left  of  a line  between  the  hive 
and  the  sun.  So  precise  is  the  apian  system  of  communication,  von  Frisch 
found,  that  it  steers  bees  directly  even  to  food  hidden  behind  the  ridge  of  a 
mountain.  But  this  study,  while  valuable  in  learning  about  the  creatures  that  man 
might  find  on  other  planets,  has  little  relevance  to  communicating  with  them. 

In  any  event,  communication  by  direct  contact  occupies  but  a small  part  of 
the  problem  of  messages  from  outer  space.  It  is  highly  questionable  whether 
intelligent  life  even  exists  on  Venus  or  Mars,  and  the  frozen  black  voids  of 
interstellar  space  are  so  inconceivably  vast  that  many  scientists  feel  that  man 
will  never  attempt  to  cross  them  in  spaceships.  Relativity  limits  any  vehicle 
to  the  speed  of  light,  and  in  a galaxy  60,000  light-years  across  it  would  take 
eons  even  at  that  speed — which  no  human  conveyance  shows  any  sign  of  even 
approaching — to  penetrate  even  part  way  into  the  more  populous  neighbor- 
hoods of  the  galaxy. 

Some  scientists  think,  nevertheless,  that  some  sort  of  tangible  object  might 
be  sent  on  such  a flight  by  one  advanced  civilization  seeking  to  contact  another. 
Leslie  C.  Edie  wondered  whether  one  might  not  fill  a maintenance-lree 
package  with  a great  deal  of  information  and  set  it  adrift  in  the  gravitational 
currents  of  space,  rather  like  a message  in  a bottle  intended  for  a distant 
shore.  Perhaps  the  messages  might  be  graven  microscopically  on  ultrathin 
metal  plates,  or  perhaps  even  organized  into  the  structure  of  the  molecules  to 
convey  information — surely  as  compact  a message  as  is  possible.  Edie  sug- 
gested looking  again  at  meteorites  to  see  whether  anything  like  this  has  already 
been  done  with  the  carbonaceous  material  sometimes  found  therein.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 

A rather  similar  technique  was  envisioned  in  1962  by  Dr.  Ronald  N. 
Bracewell,  a leading  radio  astronomer.  Bracewell  has  suggested  that  the 
traveling  package  might  consist  of  a radio  with  tape-recorded  messages,  or 
perhaps  directed  by  a microminiaturized  computer  with  the  size  and  memory- 
capacity  of  a human  brain.  The  advanced  society  would  aim  this  to  swing 
silently  among  the  planets  of  the  target  star,  scanning  all  radio  frequencies. 
When  it  heard  a signal,  it  would  mimic  back  that  signal  on  the  same  frequency. 
If  the  planet  then  repeated  this  message  once  again,  indicating  that  it  was 
ready  to  accept  the  information,  the  probe  would  automatically  pour  out  its 
information.  Presumably  it  would  carry  an  encyclopedic  store  of  knowledge. 
“Such  a probe  may  be  here  now,  in  our  solar  system,  trying  to  make  its 
presence  known,”  Bracewell  wrote.  As  evidence,  he  offered  several  unex- 
plained radio  “echoes”  heard  in  1927,  1928,  and  1934  by  several  careful 
scientists.  These  “echoes,”  Bracewell  thought,  were  in  reality  the  probe’s 
repeating  back  to  Earth  the  signals  that  it  had  heard  to  alert  Earth  to  its  pres- 
ence. His  idea  has  been  criticized  on  several  grounds,  among  them  that  while 
it  might  not  cost  too  much  for  a civilization  to  spray  such  probes  into  the  sur- 
rounding space,  it  seems  exceedingly  difficult  to  armor  them  against  the 
erosion  of  space  for  hundreds  of  millions  of  years.  In  any  event,  the  theory 
has  not  received  widespread  acceptance. 

Perhaps  the  object  to  be  sent  might  consist  of  the  lightest  “things”  in  the 
universe — electrons.  An  electron  gun  could  shoot  beams  of  these  charged 
particles  through  space.  They  would  be  received  by  a scintillation  detector, 
which  gives  off  flashes  of  light  whenever  an  electron  hits  it.  The  system  can 
carry  a great  deal  of  information  with  high  efficiency,  but  its  range  seems 
limited  to  about  100,000  miles — far  under  the  trillions  needed  for  interstellar 
communication.  The  same  general  idea  has  been  proposed  for  another  sub- 
atomic particle,  the  neutrino.  It  would  be  ideal  for  long-distance  communica- 
tion, since  it  weighs  nothing  and  carries  no  electric  charge,  and  hence  would 
not  be  distracted  from  its  course  by  the  magnetic  fields  of  space.  There  is  a 
little  problem  in  that  scientists  on  Earth  are  hard  put  to  detect  their  presence 
at  all — neutrinos  pass  all  the  way  through  Earth  without  leaving  any  evidence 
of  their  passage — and  observing  a modulated  beam  of  them  seems  definitely 
beyond  present  terrestrial  capacities.  Other  civilizations,  however,  may  have 
solved  these  problems. 

The  fastest  and  cheapest  means  of  interstellar  communication  appears  to 
be,  not  by  object,  but  by  electromagnetic  waves.  These  are  the  waves  of  radio, 
heat,  light,  ultraviolet,  X rays,  and  gamma  radiation.  All,  of  course,  travel  at 
the  speed  of  light.  And  it  is  clearly  easier  to  push  a radio  signal  out  into  space 
than  to  launch  a probe.  “Interstellar  communication  across  the  galactic 
plasma  without  dispersion  in  direction  and  flight  time  is  practical,  so  far  as 
we  know,  only  with  electromagnetic  waves,”  wrote  Cocconi  and  Morrison. 

The  question  at  once  arises.  Which  waves?  Natural  considerations  quickly 


947

limit  the  possibilities.  Signals  by  X rays  cannot  be  focused.  Gamma  rays  are 
given  off  by  radioactive  materials;  perhaps  these  unwanted  by-products  of  a 
nuclear  reactor  might  find  useful  employment  in  space  communication.  Un- 
fortunately, they  do  not  carry  beyond  100,000  miles,  and,  so,  like  electrons, 
have  insufficient  range. 

Morrison  has  made  the  imaginative  suggestion  that  a civilization  fling  an 
opaque  screen,  perhaps  consisting  of  many  individual  morsels  of  matter,  into 
space  on  a line  between  the  parent  sun  and  the  target  star.  The  civilization 
would  move  the  screen,  perhaps  by  magnetism,  into  and  out  of  that  line, 
thereby  causing  the  whole  parent  sun  to  appear  to  blink.  The  pattern  of  the 
blinks  would,  of  course,  form  the  signal.  An  effort  of  this  magnitude  might  not 
be  too  difficult  for  an  advanced  society.  A subtle  refinement  of  this,  suggested 
by  Drake,  uses  a cloud  of  material  that  would  absorb,  not  all  the  light,  but 
only  certain  wavelengths  of  it.  These  missing  wavelengths,  which  would  leave 
a black  line  in  a spectrogram  of  the  star’s  light,  would  indicate  the  existence  of 
an  artificial  element  and  consequently  of  a civilization.  Though  Drake  seemed 
to  propose  this  more  as  an  indicator  than  as  a signal  device,  it  might  be  pos- 
sible to  shift  this  cloud,  or  renew  it  in  the  face  of  its  dispersion  by  the  outflow 
of  gas  from  the  star,  and  so  transmit  messages.  Another  possible  light-wave 
system  uses  the  natural  absorption  by  elements  in  a star’s  atmosphere  of  cer- 
tain wavelengths  of  the  light  emitted  by  its  incandescent  body.  This  absorp- 
tion likewise  leaves  a black  line  in  the  otherwise  bright  and  rainbowlike 
spectrogram  of  its  light.  Dr.  Charles  Townes,  who  won  a Nobel  Prize  for 
fathering  the  maser  and  its  optical  cousin,  the  laser,  suggested,  with  a col- 
league, Robert  N.  Schwartz,  that  laser  light,  which  can  be  very  finely  tuned, 
might  be  focused  into  the  narrow  slot  of  the  black  absorption  line,  like  fitting 
a key  into  a keyhole,  and  turned  on  and  off  to  send  messages.  Astronomers  on 
distant  planets,  seeing  the  fine  inner  line  of  light  where  nature  would  not  have 
it,  would  recognize  it  as  artificial. 

While  all  these  methods  may  be  feasible  despite  their  great  technical  diffi- 
culties, the  most  practical  method  of  all  appears  to  be  radio.  Man  today  has  a 
sophisticated  understanding  of  radio’s  superiority.  But  in  an  almost  instinc- 
tive fashion,  man  recognized  radio  as  a natural  choice  for  interplanetary  com- 
munication soon  after  it  was  invented.  Nikola  Tesla,  who  was  a pioneer  in  the 
field  and  who,  though  an  eccentric,  made  solid  contributions,  observed  at  his 
radio  laboratory  in  Colorado  in  1899  periodic  “electrical  actions"  with  “a 
clear  suggestion  of  number  and  order  that  were  not  traceable  to  any  cause 
then  known  to  me.”  “The  feeling  is  constantly  growing  on  me,”  he  wrote, 
“that  I had  been  the  first  to  hear  the  greeting  of  one  planet  to  another.” 
Twenty-one  years  later,  the  inventor  of  radio,  Guglielmo  Marconi,  was 
reported  as  saying  that  some  inexplicable  radio  signals  heard  by  his  company 
on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic  might  be  signals  from  another  planet.  They  are 
now  thought  to  be  the  phenomenon  known  as  “whistlers,"  caused  by  light- 
ning, heard  by  Marconi  years  before  others  had  noticed  them.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


With  the  close  approach  of  Mars  to  Earth  in  1924,  the  question  of  Mars- 
Earth  communication  erupted  into  excited  discussion.  Lieutenant  Commander 
Fitzhugh  Green  asked,  “Could  We  Decode  Messages  From  Mars?”  in 
Popular  Science  Monthly,  and  went  on  to  note  that  “Twenty-one  dilferent 
methods  have  been  suggested  to  communicate  with  Mars  this  summer” — 
none  of  them  particularly  acute.  David  Todd,  former  head  of  the  astronomy 
department  at  Amherst  College,  sought  to  have  all  radio  stations  on  Earth 
shut  down  during  the  passage  and  listen  for  signals  from  Mars.  The  Army  and 
Navy  actually  ordered  their  stations  to  avoid  unnecessary  transmissions  and 
to  listen  for  unusual  signals.  The  executive  officer  of  the  Signal  Corps  an- 
nounced that  the  chief  of  its  code  section,  one  William  F.  Friedman,  was 
standing  by  to  decipher  any  messages  received.  At  Camp  Alfred  Vail,  the 
Army’s  major  Signal  Corps  center,  now  Fort  Monmouth,  three  radio  stations 
did  listen.  Others  may  have  searched  the  radio  bands  too.  This  was,  despite 
its  haphazard,  transient,  and  superficial  nature,  man’s  first  known  attempt  to 
listen  for  messages  from  other  worlds.  On  the  night  of  August  24  recorded 
dashes  followed  by  a voice  pronouncing  words  were  heard.  Nothing  was 
done  about  it,  as  it  seemed  to  be  just  a human  radio  test.  In  addition,  a 
Washington  man  named  Jenkins,  an  early  television  pioneer,  heard  some 
mysterious  signals  that  he  recorded  on  moving  photographic  strips  from  1 
p.m.  August  22  to  5 p.m.  August  23,  1924.  Accepting  the  Signal  Corps’ 
implied  invitation,  he  brought  the  strips  to  Friedman’s  office.  Recalled 
Friedman:  “1  thought  him  a sort  of  visionary  and  didn’t  try  to  do  anything 
with  his  record.  I was  probably  wrong!” 

Since  that  time,  the  development  of  radio  astronomy  and  general  advances 
in  radio  technique  have  made  it  possible  to  eliminate  large  portions  of  the 
radio  spectrum  as  likely  channels  for  any  messages  from  outer  space.  For  a 
number  of  technical  reasons — attenuation  in  space,  power  required,  facility 
of  reception — “The  wide  radio  band  from,  say  1 Me  [megacycle]  to  104  Me, 
remains  as  the  rational  choice,”  Cocconi  and  Morrison  wrote.  But  where 
precisely  in  this  still  enormous  range  should  man  listen?  The  question  is  that 
which  faces  the  driver  of  a car  who  is  in  a part  of  the  country  where  he  does 
not  know  the  radio  stations  but  wants  to  pick  up  the  broadcast  of  a particular 
major-league  ball  game.  He  has  to  tune  his  radio  across  the  entire  dial, 
listening  at  each  station,  until  he  finds  what  he  wants.  With  interstellar 
broadcasts,  not  only  is  the  dial  immensely  broader,  but  also  the  signal  would 
be  far  weaker  and  far  less  recognizable  than  the  voice  of  a familiar  an- 
nouncer. 

Fortunately,  “just  in  the  most  favored  radio  region,”  Cocconi  and  Morri- 
son pointed  out,  “there  lies  a unique,  objective  standard  of  frequency,  which 
must  be  known  to  every  observer  in  the  universe.”  This  is  the  so-called  radio 
emission  line  of  neutral  hydrogen,  only  discovered  by  man  in  1951.  For  physi- 
cal reasons,  the  axis  of  the  spinning  of  the  hydrogen  electron  around  its 
nucleus  wobbles,  or  precesses,  at  the  rate  of  1,420,405,752  times  a second.  Out

Messages  from  Outer  Space 

in  space,  individual  hydrogen  atoms  occasionally  collide  with  one  another. 
This  gives  them  a bit  of  extra  energy,  which  they  later  cast  off  in  the  form  of 
an  electromagnetic  wave  vibrating  at  the  same  rate  as  the  precession  ot  the 
spin  axis.  This  is  a radio  wave  of  1,420,405,752  cycles  per  second,  or  roughly 
1,420  megacycles.  Since  all  electromagnetic  waves  travel  at  the  same  speed, 
this  frequency  corresponds  to  a wavelength  of  21  centimeters,  or  8^  inches. 
Vast  clouds  of  hydrogen  float  in  the  galaxy,  and  all  the  individual  atomic 
emissions  combine  into  a steady  hum  of  radio  noise  at  that  frequency,  or 
“station,”  on  the  celestial  dial.  In  a sense,  this  produces  a homing  beacon,  a 
standard  landmark  in  the  radio  range  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum.  “There- 
fore we  think  it  most  promising  to  search  in  the  neighborhood  of  1420  Me/ 
sec,”  the  two  physicists  wrote.  Not  directly  on  the  hydrogen  emission  line, 
for  anyone  foolish  enough  to  send  his  signals  right  at  that  frequency  would 
have  them  jammed  by  the  hydrogen  noise,  but  at  frequencies  nearby,  or 
perhaps  at  double  or  half  that  frequency.  The  listening  frequencies  should  be 
relatively  free  of  cosmic  radio  noise,  or  static,  which  stars  and  nebula  generate 
just  as  they  generate  light  and  heat  in  other  parts  of  the  electromagnetic 
spectrum. 

The  next  question  to  be  faced  in  the  process  of  narrowing  down  the  poten- 
tial channels  is:  Where  are  the  broadcasts  likely  to  come  from?  It  is  not 
practicable  simply  to  tune  a receiver  to  1,420  megacycles  and  start  listening 
for  a signal  from  anywhere  in  the  sky.  Cosmic  noise  from  all  over  space  would 
drown  it  out.  Rather,  any  searchers  would  have  to  direct  their  antennae  at  a 
possible  sender  to  better  pick  up  any  signals — just  as  a portable  radio  plays 
louder  when  its  antenna  is  pointed  at  the  transmitter.  The  question  of  “where” 
really  amounted  to  a consideration  of  the  stars  that  were  likely  to  have  planets 
that  may  have  evolved  life.  This  meant  long-lived,  slow-turning  stars  rather 
like  the  sun.  Naturally,  the  nearer  stars  would  be  considered  first.  Many  of 
the  45  that  lie  within  16  light-years  of  the  solar  system  must  be  excluded 
because  they  do  not  meet  the  conditions.  The  nearest  star,  Alpha  Centauri,  is 
actually  a triple  star — three  stars  revolving  around  one  another — for  which 
an  orbit  with  a habitable  life-zone  seems  most  unlikely.  In  the  neighborhood 
of  the  solar  system,  then,  only  a dozen  or  so  stars  met  the  requirements. 
Some  of  them,  however,  lay  directly  against  a background  of  stars  that  pro- 
duced a great  deal  of  cosmic  noise,  which  meant  that  it  would  be  extra  hard 
to  detect  any  signals  from  them.  Ruling  these  out  left  two  nearby  stars  as  the 
most  likely  contenders:  Tau  Ceti,  in  the  constellation  of  the  Whale,  and 
Epsilon  Eridani,  in  the  constellation  of  the  River  Eridanus.  Both  are  rather 
smaller  than  the  sun,  with  one  third  its  luminosity,  but  both,  like  the  sun,  are 
long-lived  and  slow-turning.  These  conclusions  were  reached  independently 
by  a number  of  theoreticians,  including  Drake,  Cocconi  and  Morrison,  and 
Su-Shu  Huang,  who  first  formulated  the  concept  of  habitable  zones. 

Consequently,  it  was  at  Tau  Ceti  that  Drake  first  aimed  his  85-foot  radio 
telescope  on  the  morning  of  April  8,  1960.  Because  of  the  probable  difficulty 


950 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


of  isolating  the  possible  intelligible  signals  from  the  constant  background 
crackle  of  cosmic  static,  he  had  worked  out  several  ingenious  techniques  to 
make  any  signal  stand  out  more  clearly.  They  resemble  somewhat  the  elec- 
tronic warfare  techniques  of  electronic  counter-countermeasures — and  it 
may  be  significant  that  Drake  spent  three  years  of  military  service  as  electron- 
ics officer  aboard  the  heavy  cruiser  U.S.S.  Albany.  They  may  also  owe  some- 
thing to  techniques  developed  to  detect  radar  echoes  from  Venus  that  were 
extremely  faint — one  hundredth  of  a billionth  of  a billionth  of  a watt. 

In  one  of  Drake’s  techniques,  the  radio  telescope  looked  alternately  at  the 
star  and  at  a patch  of  sky  near  the  star.  The  latter  delivered  to  the  telescope 
only  general  cosmic  noise,  without  any  emissions  from  the  star,  while  the 
former  delivered  noise  plus  any  emissions.  Drake’s  equipment  compared  the 
two  and  took  note  only  of  any  emission  from  the  star  whose  strength  rose 
above  the  general  noise  level.  This  would  be  the  signal.  The  other  technique 
depended  upon  the  fact  that  one  potato  more  does  not  make  much  difference 
to  a carload  but  does  to  a grocer  weighing  out  a pound.  Electronic  equip- 
ment balanced  two  unequal  incoming  emissions : a very  broad  band  of  noise 
and  a narrow  band  within  it.  The  radio  telescope  listened  on  successive  narrow 
bands  within  the  broad  one.  If  a signal  were  present  in  the  broad  band  but  not 
in  the  narrow  one  being  listened  to,  its  strength  would  be  negligible  compared 
with  all  the  noise  and  so  the  emissions  would  remain  balanced.  But  if  the 
narrow  band  picked  up  the  signal,  the  signal  would  concentrate  all  its  weight 
in  that  band  and  would  throw  the  two  emissions  out  of  balance.  The  differ- 
ence between  them  would  constitute  the  artificial  signal. 

Drake  called  his  effort  “Project  Ozma,”  after  the  name  of  the  queen  of  the 
imaginary  land  of  Oz — “a  place  very  far  away,  difficult  to  reach,  and  popula- 
ted by  exotic  beings.”  His  equipment  tuned  automatically  across  400,000 
cycles  of  the  radio  spectrum,  centered  on  the  hydrogen  frequency.  The  switch 
that  automatically  tuned  the  receiver  from  one  100-cycle  band  to  the  next 
after  a minute’s  observation  was  the  last  one  he  snapped  on  the  historic 
morning  of  April  8,  1960,  as  man  began  his  first  major  attempt  to  find  life  in 
other  solar  systems. 

Throughout  the  day  the  giant  saucer  of  his  radio  telescope  swiveled 
slowly  as  it  followed  Tau  Ceti,  its  light  invisible  in  the  glare  of  the  sun,  across 
the  sky.  Only  the  hisses  and  buzzes  of  cosmic  noise  had  come  in  on  the  loud- 
speaker, only  the  formless  wiggles  of  its  graphic  representation  on  paper  had 
been  recorded.  As  Tau  Ceti  began  setting  in  the  west,  Drake,  who  had  been  in 
and  out  of  the  control  room  during  the  day,  decided  to  swing  to  Epsilon 
Eridani,  his  other  possibility.  No  sooner  had  he  done  so  than  the  pen,  Drake 
said,  “went  bang  off  scale” — knocked  there  by  some  very  powerful  signal. 
With  the  volume  turned  down,  the  pen  smoothly  wrote  a uniform  series  of 
pulses,  eight  to  the  second.  They  could  only  have  been  produced  artificially,  by 
some  intelligence.  There  was,  Drake  said,  “a  moderate  amount  of  pandemon- 
ium” in  the  control  room.  Checks  of  the  equipment  showed  no  flaws.  And

before  the  telescope  could  be  moved  to  see  if  the  signal  remained  strong  from 
other  directions  of  the  sky,  which  would  indicate  a non-Epsilon  Eridani 
source,  it  abruptly  stopped. 

Drake  strongly  doubted  that  he  had  actually  trapped  an  interstellar  signal 
on  his  first  try.  The  chances  were  much  too  remote.  He  said  nothing  about  it, 
and  two  weeks  later,  when  he  heard  the  marching  pulses  again,  he  tested  their 
origin  by  steering  the  antenna  off  the  star.  As  he  had  suspected,  the  pulses 
continued,  proving  that  they  came  from  somewhere  on  Earth,  probably  as  a 
result  of  some  radar  countermeasures  work. 

Project  Ozma  continued  for  a total  of  about  150  hours  of  listening  through 
July  of  1960,  without  any  evidence  of  interstellar  signals.  Then  it  was  sus- 
pended, mainly  because  the  telescope  was  needed  in  other  projects,  but  also 
partly  out  of  flagging  interest  in  the  face  of  no  results.  Drake  had  hoped  to 
resume  listening  with  a new  600-foot  radio  telescope  that  the  Navy  was  then 
constructing,  but  this  project  was  abandoned,  and  Ozma  left  in  abeyance. 

Occasionally,  during  the  public  discussion  of  Ozma,  a voice  would  be 
heard  protesting  against  it.  Perhaps,  to  the  advanced  creatures  of  another 
civilization,  men  might  be  nothing  more  than  a tasty-looking  herd  of  beef 
cattle.  Why  tempt  fate?  There  were  a number  of  answers  to  this.  One  was  the 
immense  distances  to  be  covered  and  the  unlikelihood  that  anyone  would 
travel  so  far  just  for  a steak.  Another  was  the  length  of  the  voyage:  by  the 
time  they  arrived,  Earth  might  well  be  able  to  protect  itself.  Another  was  that 
a civilization  advanced  enough  to  be  able  to  contact  Earth  would  probably 
have  figured  out  its  food  supply  problem  for  itself.  All  may  be  summarized  in 
a single  point  of  view:  that  the  only  thing  worth  traveling  for  (over  great  dis- 
tances) is  information.  It  would  not  be  worthwhile  to  mine  diamonds  or  iron 
on  Mars;  synthetics  made  on  Earth  would  be  much  cheaper.  Nobel  Prize 
winner  Edward  Purcell,  discoverer  of  the  hydrogen  radio  emission  line,  felt 
certain  that  “No  one  can  threaten  anyone  else  with  objects,”  and  that  inter- 
stellar conversation  would  be,  “in  the  deepest  sense,  utterly  benign. 

What,  some  people  asked,  if  everybody  is  listening  and  no  one  is  sending? 
For  example,  Dr.  Harrison  S.  Brown  told  Congressman  Daddario  during  the 
hearings  of  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Astronautics:  "I  would  say  that  the 
success  of  Project  Ozma  will  depend  almost  entirely  upon  how  Congressmen 
in  these  other  systems  have  behaved.  Have  they  allocated  the  funds,  the  very 
substantial  funds  necessary  to  build  the  fantastically  powerful  transmitting 
systems  which  could  be  necessary?  And  here  I am  perhaps  gloomy.  1 try  to 
think  how  you  gentlemen  would  react  to  a proposal  to  build  at  great  expense 
a transmitter  which  would  send  signals  which  the  inhabitants  of  another  star 
may  or  may  not  hear  in  a few  million  years,  and  I believe  that  such  a bill 
probably  would  receive  somewhat  less  than  enthusiastic  attention.”  Brown 
was  probably  politically  right  but  technologically  wrong.  It  seems  possible 
that  advanced  civilizations  could  detect  emerging  ones  by  stray  radio  signals

that  leak  out  into  the  cosmos  as  part  of  the  planet’s  ordinary  activities— radio 
broadcasting,  high-powered  military  communications,  satellite  relay  trans- 
missions, and  especially  long-range  radar.  In  the  case  of  Earth,  some  wags, 
thinking  of  soap  operas  and  disk  jockeys,  have  remarked  that  this  might 
deter  more  than  invite. 

One  of  the  most  curious  facts  about  any  interstellar  conversation  will  be 
the  long  delays  it  would  involve.  Since  it  takes  radio  waves  traveling  at  the 
speed  of  light  20  years  to  reach  a planet  20  light-years  away,  conversation 
would  have  to  proceed  at  a leisurely  pace.  Obviously,  men  would  not  transmit 
a message,  then  do  nothing  for  40  years  until  a reply  came  back.  Both  sides 
would  exchange  continual  streams  of  information.  The  answers  would,  in  a 
sense,  be  a legacy  for  the  inquirers’  children.  And  perhaps,  Walter  Sullivan 
suggests  in  his  We  Are  Not  Alone,  just  as  children  are  a form  of  physical  im- 
mortality for  men,  so  knowledge  might  constitute  a form  of  intellectual  im- 
mortality for  whole  worlds.  “Bertrand  Russell  has  pointed  out  that  ‘all  the 
labours  of  the  ages,  all  the  devotion,  all  the  inspiration,  all  the  noonday 
brightness  of  human  genius,  are  destined  to  extinction  in  the  vast  death  of  the 
solar  system.’  Yet  it  seems  that  life,  in  a sense,  may  be  eternal.  Perhaps  true 
wisdom  is  a torch— one  that  we  have  not  yet  received,  but  that  can  be  handed 
to  us  by  a civilization  late  in  its  life  and  passed  on  by  our  own  world  as  its 
time  of  extinction  draws  near.” 

But  how  would  we  actually  communicate?  What  would  the  language  of  the 
transmission  be?  No  simple  show-and-tell  process  will  be  possible. 

Many  scientists  think  that  other  civilizations  will  hail  us  with  a special 
calling  signal.  “We  expect  that  the  signal  will  be  pulse-modulated  with  a speed 
not  very  fast  or  very  slow  compared  to  a second,  on  grounds  of  bandwidth  and 
of  rotations,”  wrote  Cocconi  and  Morrison.  “For  indisputable  identification 
as  an  artificial  signal,  one  signal  might  contain,  for  example,  a sequence  of 
small  prime  numbers  of  pulses,  or  simple  arithmetical  sums.  Nikola  Tesla 
envisioned  the  same  thing  when  he  imagined  that  terrestrial  astronomers 
would  announce  the  first  cosmic  contact  with  the  words:  “Brethren!  We  have 
a message  from  another  world,  unknown  and  remote.  It  reads : one  . . . two 
. . . three  ...” 

As  for  the  language  of  the  text,  no  one  on  Earth  can  make  a useful  guess. 
Probably  the  one  overriding  principle  of  the  outer-spacelings  will  have  been  to 
make  their  message  as  clear  as  possible.  It  will  be  coded,  but  in  a code  designed 
for  clarity  and  not  for  obscurity— a kind  of  cryptography  in  reverse,  as 
Edward  Purcell  has  said,  an  anticryptography.  Will  the  skills  of  the  crypto- 
logist  be  required  to  help  read  it?  His  specialized  knowledge  of  letter  frequen- 
cies and  KerckhoiTs  superimpositions  will  naturally  be  useless  and  unneces- 
sary on  a plaintext  in  an  unknown  language.  But  his  talent  for  seeing  patterns 
in  unfamiliar  texts  may  well  prove  of  vital  assistance.  Perhaps  the  cryptologist 
will  attend  the  translation  conference  with  the  logician,  the  mathematician,

the  linguist,  the  biologist,  the  astronomer,  the  radio  engineer.  If  so,  it  would 
mark  the  fitting  summit  of  a career  whose  long  road  began  more  than  4,000 
years  earlier;  for  cryptology,  it  would  be  the  ultimate  solution. 

While  it  is  impossible  to  predict  what  the  language  of  the  outer-spacelings’ 
message  is  likely  to  be,  Russian  linguist  N.  D.  Andreyev  of  the  Leningrad 
Academy  of  Sciences  has  recently  proposed  a method  that  he  believes 
will  enable  men  to  decipher  any  language.  Using  what  he  calls  “statistical- 
combinatory”  analysis,  he  measures  six  different  parameters  in  a text,  such 
as  the  distance  of  one  word  from  another  in  a sentence,  to  arrive  at  a semantic 
relationship  between  words.  Testing  this  on  human  languages,  he  has 
ascertained  the  meaning  of  verbal  symbols.  "The  data  are  uneven,  he 
wrote.  “For  several  words  their  exact  meanings  are  obtained;  other  words 
group  themselves  into  clearly  delimited  and  semantically  homogeneous  sets 
with  a definite  meaning  in  common  (but  without  specifying  individual  notions 
belonging  to  single  members  of  a set);  some  words  reveal  only  their  broad 
semantic  class  and  do  not  permit  any  delimitative  grouping.”  His  work  on  the 
problem  has  just  begun,  but  it  seems  to  show  promise. 

But  how  will  man  reply?  Here  the  thinking  has  been  primarily  that  of 
logicians,  mathematicians,  and  astronomers.  Their  proposals  may  be  said  to 
fall  into  two  categories.  One  group  bases  its  language  primarily  on  mathe- 
matical logic.  The  other  depends  basically  upon  pictures. 

It  is  evident  that  no  one  is  going  to  try  to  beam  a message  in  Esperanto  to 
the  creatures  of  another  world.  That  artificial  language  rests  too  directly  upon 
those  of  Earth ; it  belongs  to  the  type  of  artificial  language  called  a posteriori 
because  it  is  based  upon  existing  tongues.  But  the  logico-mathematical  propo- 
sals for  an  interstellar  language  have  in  their  background  the  other  kind  of  arti- 
ficial language,  the  kind  called  a priori,  in  which  all  experience  is  categorized 
logically  and  the  language  molded  upon  these  categories.  The  first  artificial 
languages  were  of  these  kind ; it  is  the  kind  that  Friedman  thinks  may  lie  under 
the  mystery  of  the  Voynich  manuscript.  Many  different  systems  have  been 
proposed.  They  arose  early  in  the  1600s,  as  Latin,  which  had  been  the  inter- 
national language,  fell  into  disuse  in  scholarship  and  governmental  institu- 
tions. In  a letter  in  1629,  Descartes  urged  the  creation  of  a philosophical  lan- 
guage in  which  simple  ideas  would  be  so  denominated  that  they  could  be 
combined  into  more  complex  ones  as  are  letters  into  words.  Leibnitz  likewise 
dreamed  of  such  a language,  which  he  hoped  would  avoid  many  philoso- 
phical problems  based  solely  on  linguistic  confusions.  Such  languages  were 
even  worked  out,  the  first  by  George  Dalgarno.  Bishop  Wilkins  followed 
with  another,  using  signs  and  attached  wiggles  to  indicate  ideas  and  their 
relations.  Some  were  almost  bizarre,  using  numbers  to  build  up  a scheme 
of  existence,  as  Timerio,  in  which  “I  love  you"  became  1-80-17,  or  using 
musical  notes,  like  Solresol,  in  which  “Domisol”  signifies  "God  ’ and  "Sol- 
mido”  means  “Satan.”  Its  inventor,  Jean-Frangois  Sudre,  noted  that  it  could 
be  sung  or,  if  the  seven  notes  were  replaced  by  seven  colors,  painted.

THE  CODEBREAKERS 


Near  the  end  of  the  19th  century,  the  Italian  mathematician  Giuseppe 
Peano  sought  to  reduce  as  much  as  possible  of  the  language  used  in  mathe- 
matics and  logic  to  formulas.  He  tried  to  formalize  not  the  subject  of  mathe- 
matical thought — the  equations  in  the  books — since  this  had  been  done  long 
before,  but  mathematical  thought  itself,  the  running  text  that  surrounds  the 
equations.  For  this  he  created  symbols  for  “and,”  “or,”  “not,”  “implies,” 
“every,”  and  other  logical  terms  that  previously  had  to  be  expressed  verbally. 
He  hoped  this  would  facilitate  scientific  thought  in  nonmathematical  areas, 
just  as  mathematics  did  in  quantitative  areas.  (Peano  also  invented  a simpli- 
fied Latin  for  ordinary  discourse,  which  he  described  in  a speech  in  Turin  in 
1903.  He  began  in  almost  classic  Latin,  and  as  he  explained  his  various 
simplifications  he  introduced  them  into  his  talk,  ending  up  with  his  almost 
grammarless  “Latino  sine  flexione.”)  Peano’s  ideas  of  a mathematical  lan- 
guage were  picked  up  by  Alfred  North  Whitehead  and  Bertrand  Russell, 
whose  revolutionary  Principia  Mathematica  exposed  the  foundations  of 
mathematics  and  showed  those  of  logic  to  be  identical.  Today,  mathematical 
logic,  the  outgrowth  of  their  work,  boasts  a large  vocabulary  of  syntactical 
terms  with  which  to  express  relations  between  ideas. 

This  syntax  serves  as  the  skeleton  of  the  interstellar  language  based  on 
logic.  The  flesh  of  the  language  is  formed  by  its  vocabulary,  and  this  is  the 
work  of  Dr.  Hans  Freudenthal,  professor  of  mathematics  at  the  University  of 
Utrecht  in  the  Netherlands.  Freudenthal  designed  it  more  as  an  exercise  in 
logical  language  than  as  a serious  proposal  for  interstellar  communication, 
though  he  believes  that  it  could  fulfill  that  function.  He  called  his  language 
“Lincos,”  from  “lingua  cosmica.”  Its  sounds  consist  of  radio  signals  of  various 
lengths  and  frequencies;  its  word-divisions  and  punctuation  consist  of  pauses 
of  varying  duration.  Freudenthal  did  not  specify  what  the  actual  radio  signal 
will  be  for  a given  word,  as  this  does  not  really  matter;  it  can  be  left  up  to  the 
technicians.  In  print,  he  often  represented  his  words  by  abbreviations  of 
Latin  words  meaning  the  same  thing.  Thus  “Inq,”  evidently  deriving  from 
the  Latin  “inquirere,”  stands  for  whatever  signal  is  used  for  “ask.” 

Lincos  would  have  to  be  taught  to  the  creatures  of  outer  space  before  it 
could  be  used  as  a medium  of  communication,  and  Freudenthal  proposed  to 
do  this  by  transmitting  the  statements  of  Lincos,  which  he  hoped  would  be 
relatively  self-evident,  over  and  over  again  until  the  recipients  catch  on  to  their 
meaning. 

He  began  his  program  by  sending  a series  of  messages  to  teach  the  terms 
“plus”  and  “equals.”  His  first  message  might  be  beep  beep  beep  beep  bloop 
beep  beep  tweet  beep  beep  beep  beep  beep  beep.  Next  he  might  send  beep  beep 
bloop  beep  tweet  beep  beep  beep.  After  sending  enough  of  these  for  the  outer- 
spacelings  to  catch  on  to  the  idea  that  bloop  is  “plus”  and  tweet  is  “equals,’ 
he  might  transmit  a message  with  a new  signal,  like  beep  beep  beep  blip  beep 
tweet  beep  beep.  Soon  the  spacelings  would  realize  that  blip  means  “minus." 
Similarly,  Freudenthal  would  build  up  an  entire  mathematical  vocabulary.

He  would  then  introduce  the  notion  of  time  by  sending,  say,  a seven- 
second  dash,  then  a Lincos  word  meaning  “second,”  then  seven  pulses.  By 
repeating  this  pattern  with  dashes  of  different  lengths,  the  listeners  would 
eventually  notice  that  the  duration  of  the  dash  is  proportional  to  the  number 
following,  and  would  thus  ascertain  the  length  of  Earth’s  time-unit.

A page  of  the  cosmic  language  “ Uncos ” in  the  notation  of  mathematical  logic  which 
its  inventor  uses  as  its  script,  showing  a discussion  between  Human  a and  Human  b 

Human  behavior  would  be  demonstrated  through  a kind  of  Lincos  radio- 
play. A new  signal  would  be  followed  by  an  incomplete  Lincos  statement,  such 
as  “six  plus  four  equals  ...”  A second  new  signal  would  be  followed  by  the 
Lincos  word  for  “ten."  These  two  new  signals  would  continue  querying  one 
another  on  mathematical  problems — the  only  topic  available  for  discussion 
to  beginning  speakers  of  Lincos.  During  these  colloquies  they  would  use — 
and  therefore  teach — the  Lincos  terms  “says,”  “good,”  “bad,”  “who,” 


956 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


“allows,”  and  so  forth.  The  outer-space  listeners  would  also  divine,  Freuden- 
thal  expected,  that  the  signals  are  actually  the  Lincos  names  for  sapient  beings. 
Eventually,  Freudenthal  would  have  two  beings  perceive  the  same  event  at 
different  times — and  therefore  in  different  places.  This  new  notion,  location, 
would  lead  into  definitions  of  distance,  motion,  and  mass,  and  hence  into  the 
whole  field  of  mechanics.  Universal  constants,  such  as  the  speed  of  light  or  the 
hydrogen  atom’s  radio  wavelength,  would  (with  the  known  Earth  time-unit) 
establish  Earth’s  units  of  length.  This  important  step  would  permit  descrip- 
tion of  the  earth,  the  solar  system,  human  beings,  and  so  forth.  From  here, 
Freudenthal  planned  to  strike  out  into  geography,  anatomy,  and  physiology, 
and,  on  a more  profound  level,  into  human  behavior. 

The  plan  is  well  founded  and  elaborately  prepared,  with  hundreds  of 
proposed  messages  fully  worked  out  in  Freudenthal’s  book,  Lincos:  Design 
of  a Language  for  Cosmic  Intercourse.  But  some  interesting  criticisms  have 
been  made.  One  mathematician  wondered  how  Freudenthal  can  be  so  certain 
that  the  outer-spacelings  would  think  as  he  does?  Perhaps  their  mathematics 
is  different.  Perhaps  they  would  try  to  seek  a pattern  in  the  meaningless  varia- 
tion of  the  numbers  of  beeps  used  as  illustration  in  teaching  the  elementary 
concept  of  “plus”  instead  of  concentrating  on  the  invariant  “plus”  signal.  To 
these  Freudenthal  has  replied:  “I  suppose  that  the  receivers  are  mentally 
humanlike.  Otherwise  1 would  not  know  how  to  communicate  with  them.” 
He  went  on  to  explain  that  he  referred  primarily  to  mutual  possession  of  the 
mathematics  known  to  humans,  the  only  kind  that  humans  can  imagine.  As 
for  the  variations,  “The  words  ‘plus’  and  ‘equal’  are  so  different  from  the 
regularly  fluctuating  signals  that  you  cannot  be  mistaken.  I am  absolutely  sure 
that  any  Chinese  peasant  who  has  never  understood  the  English  words  ‘plus' 
and  ‘equal’  will  understand  what  you  have  said.” 

Lancelot  Hogben,  a Fellow  of  the  Royal  Society,  editor  of  the  best-selling 
The  Loom  of  Language,  and  himself  inventor  of  an  interstellar  language, 
agreed  with  Freudenthal  up  to  the  establishment  of  temporal  signals.  But 
he  thought — and,  many  believe,  rightly — that  the  step  after  that  would  be  to 
set  up  a common  factual  framework  based  on  mutual  experience,  which 
would  have  to  be  celestial  phenomena.  “The  last  topic  about  which  we  could 
hope  to  achieve  understanding  would  be  the  actions  of  persons  in  general 
and  the  concept  of  the  ego  in  particular,”  he  wrote.  Hogben  also  saw  no 
advantage  in  converting  the  messages  into  the  Lincos  logistical  form.  The 
only  necessity  for  cosmic  speech  is  that  “terms  and  constructions  conform 
to  the  requirements  of  rigorous  semantic  rectitude,”  he  said.  But  he  seems 
to  have  missed  the  point  that  the  very  purpose  of  Lincos  is  to  secure  that 
rectitude. 

Hogben’s  own  proposal,  called  “Astraglossa,”  shared  many  of  the  basic 
principles  of  Lincos,  but  it  does  not  give  the  impression  of  solid  logical  struc- 
ture, and  hence  of  communicative  power,  that  Lincos  does.  He  devised  it  at 
the  invitation  of  the  British  Interplanetary  Society  early  in  the  1950s,  before

thoughts  of  other  worlds  had  ripened.  He  envisioned  it  in  the  form  of  a com- 
munication by  light  flashes  with  Mars,  but  explained  that  it  could  be  general- 
ized to  any  planet,  using  radio  waves. 

Hogben  began,  like  Freudenthal,  by  teaching  elementary  signals  for 
“plus”  and  “equals.”  He  suggested  teaching  time  in  conjunction  with  astron- 
omy. By  selecting  a reference  point  on  Mars  and  a celestial  event  visible  there, 
Earth  would  send  n dashes  at  n time-intervals  before  the  event  would  be  seen 
at  the  Martian  point,  then  n-  1 dashes  at  n- 1 time-intervals,  and  so  on.  For 
example,  9 dashes  might  be  sent  9 minutes  before  Martian  eyes  would  see 
Earth  occult  its  moon,  then  8 dashes  8 minutes  before,  and  so  on.  The  danger 
that  they  would  think  this  simply  a lesson  in  astronomy  could  be  averted  by 
sending  the  numbers  as  triangular  factors:  1 + 2 instead  of  3,  1 + 2 + 3 instead 
of  6,  1+2 + 3 +4  instead  of  10.  Hogben  suggested  moving  from  simple  flashes 
for  integers  to  numeration,  which  is  more  efficient,  proposing  base  2 or  base  1 2, 
preferably  the  latter  because  it  is  more  compact.  The  Martians — who,  if  they 
are  picking  up  the  communication,  can  detect  electromagnetic  energy  may 
have  also  discovered  the  absorption  lines  in  spectrograms  of  the  portion  of 
the  electromagnetic  spectrum  that  is  visible  to  humans.  This  opens  the  pos- 
sibility of  associating  the  concept  of  number  and  duration  with  the  concept  of 
matter  in  its  several  elementary  forms,”  Hogben  hypothesized. 

To  establish  negation,  Hogben  would  set  up  a new  flash  and  insert  an 
erroneous  term  in  the  series  in  juxtaposition  to  a foregoing  correct  message. 
By  repeating  the  lesson,  the  Martians  would  infer  that  the  new  flash  indicates 
negation.  He  would  explain  interrogation  by  substituting,  for  the  affirmative 
declaratory  annunciatory  flash  that  normally  precedes  a message,  a new  dual 
flash  meaning  “what”  is  the  “xth”  term  in  a number  series.  Next,  Hogben 
would  set  up  assent  and  denial.  Eventually  a question-and-answer  technique, 
combined  with  ability  to  detect  signals  from  different  transmitting  stations, 
would  make  possible  the  differentiation  of  “we”  and  "they.”  Hogben  would 
then  be  in  a position  to  ascend  to  new  levels  of  communication. 

The  earliest  system  proposed  for  cosmic  talk  partakes  of  some  features  of 
both  the  mathematical  and  the  pictorial  approaches,  but  its  feet  stand  firmly 
in  the  former.  It  was  devised  in  1896,  after  a near  approach  of  Mars  to  the 
Earth,  by  Sir  Francis  Galton,  the  founder  of  eugenics  and  an  early  proponent 
of  the  use  of  fingerprints  to  identify  criminals.  It  being  before  the  days  of 
radio,  Galton  imagined  that  the  Martians  were  communicating  with  Earth 
by  flashing  an  immense  assemblage  of  large  heliographs,  all  worked  simul- 
taneously, to  reflect  sunlight  back  toward  Earth.  The  Martians  used  three 
signals — a dot  of  1 1 seconds,  a dash  of  seconds,  and  a line  of  5 seconds. 
With  these  three  they  built  up  a system  of  numeration  to  the  base  8,  either 
because,  Galton  speculated,  they  were  using  only  three  different  signals 
(8  = 23),  or  because  they  are  highly  developed  ants  who  count  to  eight  on 
six  limbs  and  two  antennae.  After  instruction  in  addition,  subtraction,  and 
the  other  arithmetical  processes,  the  Martians  transmitted  figures  giving,  for

each  of  the  five  major  planets,  its  mean  distance  from  the  sun,  radius,  and 
time  of  rotation,  with  Earth’s  measurements  given  as  100. 

Next,  the  Martians  industriously  sent  over  signals  defining  n,  and  with 
the  help  of  this  drew  a polygon  of  24  sides.  They  named  each  side,  and,  by 
transmitting  one  name  after  another,  used  the  polygon  to  draw  pictures. 
The  first  was  of  half  of  Saturn — the  other  half  not  being  needed  because  the 
planet  is  symmetrical.  This  took  105  “stitches.”  Next  came  a picture  of  the 
North  American  continent,  which  required  88  stitches,  16  of  them  fractional 
because  of  the  indentation  of  its  shores,  while  South  America,  which  followed, 
required  only  52.  Night  after  night  the  scintillations  came  down,  progressing 
to  domestic  and  sociological  drawings.  Galton  implied  that  communication 
ceased  only  when  the  two  planets  drew  too  far  apart  along  their  orbits. 

Galton  sugared  his  discussion  with  some  humor,  and  he  deserves  credit  as 
the  pioneer  in  a new  field  of  communication.  Both  his  program  and  Hogben’s, 
however,  suffer  a serious  loss  of  generality  in  assuming  communication  with 
a planet  so  close  that  external  phenomena  are  visible — eclipses  or  occultations 
in  Hogben’s  Astraglossa,  terrestrial  geography  in  what  might  be  called 
Gabon’s  Martiansprache.  This  gives  them  an  easy  way  out  of  what  is  the 
hardest  step  for  the  mathematically  based  languages — the  leap  from  the 
conceptual  to  the  physical,  from  ideas  to  things.  In  Lincos,  which  is  much 
more  rigorously  logical  than  either  of  the  others,  this  transfer  is  the  weakest 
point. 

Concreteness  is,  on  the  other  hand,  the  strength  of  the  pictorial  approach. 
The  astute  space  expert  and  writer  Arthur  C.  Clarke  first  mentioned  this  idea, 
which  television  apparently  suggested  to  him.  Like  the  logico-mathematical 
approach,  the  pictorial  has  roots  in  precosmic  human  activity. 

Writing  itself,  of  course,  began  as  a series  of  pictures.  In  China,  a script 
that  consists  of  formalized  pictures  is  read  and  understood  to  mean  identical 
things  by  Chinese  whose  speech  is  mutually  unintelligible.  The  principle  is 
that  of  a skull  and  crossbones  on  a medicine  bottle,  which  means  danger  or 
poison  to  an  American,  a Frenchman,  a German.  Many  other  symbols  serve 
to  communicate  between  persons  whose  languages  differ:  road  signs,  chem- 
ical formulas,  notes  of  music,  Arabic  numerals. 

The  first  attempts  to  signal  man’s  presence  on  Earth  to  the  creatures  of 
another  planet — Mars — employed  diagrams.  The  German  mathematician 
Karl  Friedrich  Gauss,  whose  name  lives  in  English  today  in  the  verb  “de- 
gauss,” meaning  to  neutralize  the  magnetic  field  of  a ship,  suggested  planting 
broad  lanes  of  forest  in  Siberia  in  the  form  of  a gigantic  right-angled  triangle, 
filling  the  inside  with  wheat  to  make  it  stand  out  more  clearly.  This  geometric 
shape  would  clearly  be  an  artificial  creation.  Man  could  drive  the  point  home 
by  erecting  squares  on  each  side  of  the  triangle  to  illustrate  the  Pythagorean 
theorem.  Not  long  thereafter,  the  Viennese  astronomer  Josef  Johann  von 
Littrow  proposed  digging  canals  in  the  Sahara  to  form  geometric  figures 
with  twenty-mile  sides.  At  night  kerosene  would  be  poured  upon  the  water

and  set  ablaze.  Charles  Cros  in  France  conceived  the  idea  of  a huge  mirror  to 
reflect  sunlight,  like  a giant  heliograph,  toward  Mars. 

These  devices  could  not  convey  much  more  than  that  intelligence  exists  on 
Earth.  Moreover,  they  depend  upon  a visual  contact,  which  is  not  possible  in 
interstellar  communication.  To  express  any  real  information,  man  would  have 
to  radio  a plurality  of  pictures  or  detailed  diagrams  to  the  other  world.  Two 
ways  of  doing  so  have  been  proposed.  Both  expect  that  the  recipients  would 
arrange  the  message,  which  arrives  in  a long  one-dimensional  string  of  pulses, 
in  a two-dimensional  array.  One  method  depends  upon  spatial  relationships 
to  clue  the  recipients  to  this  rearrangement,  the  other  upon  temporal  rela- 
tionships. 

Shortly  after  the  Green  Bank  conference  on  extraterrestrial  life  in  1961, 
Frank  Drake  sent  to  the  participants,  and  later  to  other  scientists  as  well,  a 
message  based  on  the  spatial  form.  It  consisted  of  551  binary  digits — zeros 
and  ones,  which  might  have  been  transmitted  as  pulses  and  blanks  or  as  two 
kinds  of  pulses.  The  solution  of  the  problem  resembled  the  cryptanalysis  of  a 
columnar  transposition  cipher.  The  fact  that  551  is  the  product  of  two  primes, 
19  and  29,  suggested  arranging  the  digits  in  a rectangle  of  those  dimensions. 
With  29  digits  across  the  top,  no  pattern  emerged,  but  when  the  digits  were 
laid  out  in  lines  of  19  characters,  several  groupings  of  the  units — which  might 
be  envisioned  as  dots  or  marks  lying  amid  the  white  space  of  the  zeros — 
appeared.  Drake’s  message  was  highly  concentrated,  depicting  a two-legged 
creature  rather  like  a man,  evidently  the  sender  of  the  message;  schematic 
drawings  of  the  carbon  and  oxygen  atoms,  implying  that  the  creature’s 
chemistry  was,  like  man’s,  based  on  them;  the  sun  and  five  planets  of  the 
creature’s  solar  system,  with  modified  binary  numbers  for  1 to  5 opposite 
them  and  a series  of  longer  binary  numbers  that  probably  represent  the 
populations  of  the  planets  (No.  4,  with  7 billion,  apparently  being  the  home 
planet  and  two  others,  with  3,000  and  11,  apparently  being  colonized  or  ex- 
plored by  astronauts);  and,  finally,  the  creature’s  height,  given  as  31,  prob- 
ably 31  times  the  wavelength  on  which  the  message  was  sent.  Of  course,  a 
great  deal  of  this  information  is  read  into  the  message  on  the  basis  of  human 
experience,  and  it  is  doubtful  whether  so  compact  a message  would  be  trans- 
mitted at  first.  But  Drake  remarked: 

The  content  of  the  message  was  designed  to  contain  the  data  we  would  first 
like  to  know  about  another  civilization,  at  least  in  the  opinion  of  many  scientists 
who  have  thought  about  this  problem. 

In  preparing  the  message,  an  attempt  was  made  to  place  it  at  a level  of 
difficulty  such  that  a group  of  high  quality  terrestrial  scientists  of  many  disci- 
plines could  interpret  the  message  in  a time  less  than  a day.  Any  easier  message 
would  mean  that  we  are  not  sending  as  much  information  as  possible  over  the 
transmission  facilities,  and  any  harder  might  result  in  a failure  to  communicate. 
In  trying  this  puzzle  on  scientists,  it  has  been  true  so  far  that  scientists  have  under- 
stood the  parts  of  the  message  connected  with  their  own  discipline,  but  have 


960  THE  CODEBREAKERS 

usually  not  understood  the  rest.  This  is  consistent  with  the  philosophy  behind 
the  message. 

The  use  of  two  dimensions  has  made  possible  the  transmission  of  a great  deal 
of  information  with  few  bits.  This  is  because  it  is  possible  to  arrange  the  symbols 
of  the  message  in  positions  relative  to  one  another  such  that  even  the  arrange- 
ment carries  information,  when  we  employ  logic  and  our  existing  knowledge  of 
what  may  possibly  occur  in  another  planetary  system.  Thus  the  551  bits  are 
equivalent  to  approximately  25  English  words,  but  the  information  content  of  the 
message  appears  much  greater  than  that.  This  is  because  much  of  the  message 
tells  us,  by  the  placement  of  a single  symbol,  which  of  several  complicated  pos- 
sibilities is  the  one  that  has  occurred  in  the  other  planetary  system,  without 
using  bits  to  spell  out  precisely  the  possibility  that  has  occurred. 


Even  though  Drake’s  message  was  too  compressed,  the  principle  certainly 
works.  It  could  even  be  extended  to  produce  a three-dimensional  model.  The 


Interstellar  communication  by  picture:  the  position  of  the  dashes  among  the  dots  inside 
the  picture  frame  builds  up  the  image  of  a human  form 


use  of  a number  of  pulses  that  is  the  product  of  three  primes  might  hint  at  this, 
just  as  a number  resulting  from  two  primes  suggested  the  two-dimensional 
array.  So  far,  it  seems  not  to  have  been  tested. 

The  temporally  based  method  of  transmitting  images  has  been  urged  by 
Philip  Morrison.  To  mark  off  each  line  of  the  picture,  he  would  send  two 
synchronizing  pulses.  These  would  be  distinctive  and  each  pair  would  be 
separated  in  time  by  the  same  interval  as  every  other  pair.  They  would  frame 
the  picture.  Between  the  beginning  and  ending  pulses  of  each  line,  Morrison 
would  transmit  the  information-carrying  signals.  The  outer-spacelings  would 
have  to  align  these  one  under  the  other  to  form  the  picture,  hopefully  being 
guided  to  do  so  by  the  frame  of  the  synchronizing  pulses,  and  perhaps  helped 
by  the  near-similarity  and  slight  divergencies  of  successive  lines. 

Morrison  would  send  as  his  first  picture  a circle — a kind  of  test  pattern. 
The  message  would  consist  of  a number  of  units,  all  equal  in  time,  all  marked 
off  at  the  beginning  and  end  by  identical  pulses.  The  first  segment  would  con- 


961 


Messages  from  Outer  Space 

sist  of  these  two  synchronizing  pulses  with  a single  distinctive  message  pulse 
sent  midway  between  them.  The  second  segment  would  have  two  message 
pulses,  one  sent  slightly  before  and  the  other  slightly  after  the  middle  of  the 
segment.  The  third  segment  would  likewise  have  two  message-pulses,  both 
likewise  symmetrically  spaced  in  time  about  the  midpoint  but  farther  from  it. 
Successive  lines  would  continue  to  widen  the  interval  between  the  two  pulses 
until  a maximum  was  reached,  then  would  begin  to  narrow  it  again,  until  the 
final  segment  would  again  comprise  a single  message  pulse  in  the  middle  of 
the  time  interval.  When  these  are  lined  up  one  under  the  other  voila ! A 
circle. 

“Of  course,”  said  Morrison,  imagining  the  use  of  this  method  by  the  outer- 
spacelings  in  sending  messages  to  Earth,  “they  may  not  scan  linearly.  Maybe 
they  scan  in  logarithmic  spiral.  It  makes  no  difference  to  the  method.  As  long 
as  they  supply  us  with  a simple  geometric  pattern  and  some  algebraic  clue  to 
it,  we  cannot  take  very  long  to  make  out  the  nature  of  their  scanning  raster. 
The  method,  is,  of  course,  adaptable  to  sending  more  complex  images,  like 
Drake’s,  though  it  is  perhaps  not  as  suitable  for  three-dimensional  structures. 

The  temporal  scanning  principle  is,  of  course,  that  used  in  television. 
Actual  television  as  known  here  on  Earth  would  not  be  used  for  interstellar 
communication,  even  if  it  were  taught  to  the  outer-spacelings,  because  it 
requires  too  much  power  for  long  distances  and  is  not  efficient  in  transmitting 
information.  But  two  of  its  characteristics— moving  pictures  and  tones  of 
gray  (instead  of  just  black  or  white,  as  in  Drake’s  diagram)— might  eventually 
help  convey  additional  information.  For  motion,  the  simple  principle  of  movie 
cartoons  would  serve.  A series  of  images,  each  differing  slightly  from  its  pre- 
decessor, would  be  sent.  When  viewed  in  rapid  succession  they  would  appear 
to  move— at  least  to  humanlike  eyes.  For  tint  gradations,  Drake  would  con- 
vert the  brightness  of  each  spot  in  an  image  into  a number  proportional  to  the 
brightness.  White  spots  might  be  coded  as  10,  medium-gray  as  5,  very  dark 
gray  as  2,  black  as  1.  These  numbers  would  be  transmitted  instead  of  the 
binary  digits  of  his  basic  scheme.  In  a test  of  just  such  a system  for  com- 
mercial purposes  (because  it  uses  less  bandwidth  than  television),  Bell  Tele- 
phone Laboratory  engineer  R.  L.  Carbrey  found  that  pictures  of  a pretty  girl 
with  only  three  levels  of  brightness  were  perfectly  recognizable.  By  using  a 
special  transmission  code,  he  used  seven  pulses  per  spot  to  obtain  128  levels 
of  brightness  (27  = 128).  But  this  might  be  rather  sophisticated  early  in  the 
interstellar  game. 

The  great  advantage  of  the  pictorial  approach  lies  in  its  grasp  of  the  real. 
A picture  can  indeed  be  worth  a thousand  words.  But  pictures  without  cap- 
tions, objects  without  concepts  to  relate  them  to  one  another  and  to  the  higher 
realms  of  generalization,  would  afford  the  creatures  of  outer  space  but  a 
grotesque  parody  of  life  on  Earth,  and  would  in  fact  exclude  the  more  impor- 
tant things  of  that  life.  Needed  are  both  the  abstract  and  the  concrete,  and 
needed  in  interstellar  communication,  therefore,  are  both  the  logico-mathe- 


962 


THE  CODEBREAKERS 


matical  and  the  pictorial  approaches.  It  seems  most  probable  that  the  messages 
to  outer  space  would  combine  some  form  of  Lincos-like  instruction  with 
Drake’s  pictures.  Morrison  envisaged  such  a combination  in  his  television 
picture  of  a circle ; he  preceded  it  with  a brief  lesson  in  arithmetic  followed  by  a 
numerical  series  that  converged  on  n.  It  would  only  be  after  the  television 
raster  was  taught  and  enough  test  patterns  sent  to  make  the  principle  sink  in 
that  man  would  flash  pictures  of  his  world — still  or  moving — upon  the 
screen  of  the  extraterrestrial  TV  set. 

Man’s  next  step  might  well  be  to  use  pictures  to  create  a dictionary  for  a 
second-level,  verbal  language.  He  would  send  a picture  of  a triangle  and  what- 
ever radio  signal  will  be  used  for  it,  a picture  of  the  carbon  atom  and  then  its 
radio  signal,  a picture  of  a man  and  its  radio  signal.  What  might  be  the  com- 
position of  these  radio  signals?  Morse  code  might  be  used,  and  sending 
dadah  didah  dadit  (=  man)  would  be  faster  than  sending  the  picture  of  a man. 
But  the  great  redundancy  of  English  and  all  natural  languages  makes  this 
inefficient.  Much  more  economical  would  be  the  commercial  code  principle: 
as  the  radio  signal  for  “man”  or  “carbon”  or  “triangle,”  use  a group  of 
numbers  or  a combination  of  radio  frequencies.  The  redundancy  would  be 
minimal — only  that  required  to  detect  and  correct  errors.  The  numbers  need 
not  be  limited  to  base  10  any  more  than  only  ten  different  radio  frequencies 
need  be  used. 

Still  more  economy  would  be  obtained  by  varying  the  lengths  of  the  radio 
signals,  giving  those  with  the  fewest  elements  to  the  more  frequent  concepts. 
For  example,  the  idea  “hydrogen  line  emission”  would  probably  be  used  much 
more  frequently  than  the  term  “blue,”  and  so  it  would  get  a much  shorter 
signal.  This  is,  of  course,  the  principle  of  economy  used  by  Morse  in  devising 
his  telegraph  code.  Algorithms  are  known  to  communications  engineers  that 
optimally  assign  digital  groups  of  varying  lengths  to  messages  of  varying 
frequencies ; these  could  be  used  to  construct  the  most  efficient  language.  At 
first  the  communication  engineers  would  have  to  guess  at  the  probable  fre- 
quency of  the  words  in  this  language.  Later,  a corrected  version,  based  on 
experience,  might  be  constructed.  The  arrangement  of  words  and  ideas  in  this 
verbal  interstellar  language  would  then  depend  solely  upon  their  frequency. 
This  represents  a new  kind  of  artificial  language.  It  is  based  on  efficiency  and 
differs  from  both  the  “rational”  categorization  of  the  a priori  type  and  the 
natural-language  imitations  of  the  a posteriori  type. 

Sometimes  it  may  be  necessary  to  send  words  as  pictures,  as  in  the  case  of 
captions  labeling  objects  shown  in  a picture  being  sent  on  the  interstellar 
television.  The  letters  and  numbers  of  existing  Earth  alphabets  are  waste- 
ful in  design,  of  course,  and  special  symbols  would  probably  be  invented. 
The  combination  of  symbols  for  a given  word  should  naturally  correspond 
exactly  to  the  combination  of  radio  frequencies  in  that  word’s  radio  signal, 
thereby  saving  both  men  and  outer-spacelings  innumerable  headaches  in 
spelling.

All  this,  of  course,  is  to  think  and  act  like  humans  in  communicating 
with  nonhumans.  Some  scientists  are  trying  to  gain  some  knowledge  about 
this  very  problem  of  interspecies  communication  by  working  with  the  bottle- 
nose  dolphin,  or  porpoise.  This  mammal  may  have  an  intelligence  approaching 
or  equaling  man’s,  and  its  marine  environment  may  make  it  a more  alien 
race  than  any  man  may  encounter  in  space.  In  comparison  with  man  s brain, 
its  brain  is  slightly  larger,  appears  as  dense  in  nerve  fibers  as  man’s  (which  is 
not  true  of  elephant  and  whale  brains,  which  are  much  larger  than  man’s), 
and  is  even  richer  in  cortical  folds,  usually  taken  as  a rough  index  of  intelli- 
gence. Moreover,  it  has  a complex  and  efficient  vocal  language  for  talking  to 
other  dolphins.  This  consists  mostly  of  sharp,  high-pitched  whistles,  but  it  has 
imitated  human  voices  that  it  has  heard  in  the  laboratory.  Dolphins  have 
helped  other  dolphins,  and  even  humans,  in  distress.  They  have  learned  in  a 
single  try  to  push  a switch  giving  them  a pleasurable  electrical  sensation, 
whereas  monkeys  usually  need  300  or  more  attempts. 

Dr.  John  C.  Lilly,  who  is  working  on  man-dolphin  communication  at  his 
Communications  Research  Institute,  stated  with  conviction: 

If  we  are  ever  to  communicate  with  a non-human  species  of  this  planet,  the 
dolphin  is  probably  our  best  present  gamble.  In  a sense,  it  is  a joke  when  I 
fantasy  that  it  may  be  best  to  hurry  and  finish  our  work  on  their  brains  before 
one  of  them  learns  to  speak  our  language— else  he  will  demand  equal  rights  with 
men  for  their  brains  and  lives  under  our  ethical  and  legal  codes! 

Before  our  man-in-space  program  becomes  too  successful,  it  may  be  wise  to 
spend  some  time,  talent,  and  money  on  research  with  the  dolphins;  not  only  are 
they  a large-brained  species  living  their  lives  in  a situation  with  attenuated 
effects  of  gravity,  but  they  may  be  a group  with  whom  we  can  learn  basic  tech- 
niques of  communication  with  really  alien  intelligent  life  forms. 


So  far,  however,  Lilly  has  made  little  fundamental  progress— and  this  in  itself 
may  be  significant. 

Man’s  situation  in  regard  to  the  creatures  of  outer  space  and  their  mes- 
sages may  resemble  that  of  the  human  beings  in  Plato  s parable  of  the  cave. 
Trapped  in  an  underground  den,  they  thought  that  their  shadows,  thrown  on 
the  wall  before  them  by  a fire,  were  their  substances.  A whole  school  of 
linguists  thinks  that  men  are  trapped,  intellectually,  by  their  languages.  Fol- 
lowing Benjamin  Lee  Whorf,  they  point  out  that  the  way  each  language  dis- 
sects reality  imposes  a world-view  upon  its  speakers.  Whorf  thought,  for 
example,  that  Western  civilization  emphasizes  history,  clocks,  calendars, 
exactness  in  sequences  of  events,  wages  on  the  basis  of  time,  and  business 
records  because  Indo-European  languages  analyze  time  and  all  aspects  of  the 
world  in  spatial  terms.  Thus  even  nonspatial  entities  are  envisioned  by  Western 
minds  as  “something  like  a ribbon  or  scroll  marked  off  into  equal  blank 
spaces,  suggesting  that  each  be  filled  with  an  entry.”  The  Hopi  language  does 
not  emphasize  chronology  so  much,  Whorf  said,  because  it  structures  life

differently.  Many  of  its  verbs  are  conjugated  on  the  basis  of  whether  the 
speaker  saw  the  action  directly  or  had  it  reported  to  him.  On  this  view,  men 
cannot  project  their  minds  further  than  their  linguistic  preconceptions  will 
allow.  It  is  like  trying  to  see  a rainbow  in  all  its  colors  while  wearing  red 
glasses.  The  implication  is  that  interstellar  communication  may  be  fraught 
with  obstacles  and  misconceptions  of  which  man  will  be  wholly 
unaware. 

Moreover,  men  cannot  even  read  the  primitive  Mayan  hieroglyphs  or  the 
Voynich  manuscript,  and  the  simple  process  of  translation  from  one  common 
language  to  another  still  plagues  the  cause  of  peace.  If  this  be  so  between  in- 
dividuals of  the  same  species  inhabiting  the  same  planet,  how  difficult  would 
it  be  to  communicate  with  an  utterly  different  species  having  nothing  in 
common  with  man  and  living  on  a planet  invisible  to  him! 

Nothing  seems  more  certain  than  that  integers,  the  basic  system  of  count- 
ing, will  be  known  to  both  sides.  Yet  perhaps  the  outer-spacelings  think  in 
terms  of  continua,  of  curves,  of  Fourier  analyses;  perhaps  their  thinking 
begins  with  aleph-null,  the  first  number  past  infinity,  and  works  down  to 
integers,  which  would  then  be  the  last  thing  they  would  introduce.  Perhaps,  as 
cosmologist  Fred  Hoyle  has  suggested,  the  values  man  observes  for  such 
dimensionless  numbers  as  the  fine-structure  constant  might  “be  connected 
with  the  particular  oscillating  and  finite  region  [of  the  universe]  in  which  we 
happen  to  live.”  Perhaps  the  outer-spacelings  amplify  the  minute  electrical 
fluctuations  that  constitute  their  brain  waves  and  transmit  them  directly 
from  mind  to  mind.  Perhaps  they  communicate  through  some  kind  of  music, 
having  refined  it  into  a much  more  intimate  and  emotional  communication 
than  men  now  dream  of. 

So  much  is  unknown!  Who  knows  what  the  beings  of  outer  space  are  like, 
or  how  they  think  or  sense?  The  simple  idea  of  communication  by  picture 
presupposes  that  they  see.  Yet  nothing  about  them  can  be  assured  in  advance 
— the  wildest  imaginings  are  probably  but  feeble  simulacrums  of  the  truth. 
Fact  has  always  been  stranger  than  fiction.  Of  course  they  will  try  to  make  their 
messages  as  clear  as  possible,  but  what  is  clear  to  them  may  not  be  clear  to 
humans.  How,  then,  does  man  dare  hope  that  he  can  read  any  messages 
from  outer  space? 

Nothing  can  guarantee  that  he  will.  Perhaps  he  will  not,  if  the  com- 
municators differ  too  radically.  It  may  be,  as  Ulysses  found,  that  the  horizon 
of  “that  untravell’d  world”  “fades/  For  ever  and  for  ever  when  I move,”  that 
man  in  trying  to  read  such  messages  will  never  arrive  at  an  answer.  Yet  to 
succeed  he  must  begin  somewhere.  And  he  has  no  choice  but  to  start  from 
within  his  own  mental  cage:  “That  which  we  are,  we  are.”  He  must  seek  in 
order  to  find,  he  must  start  in  order  to  end,  he  must  strive  in  order  to  succeed. 

Man’s  hope  lies  in  his  intelligence.  With  it,  he  has  riddled  out  the  secrets  of 
stars  and  atoms.  He  has  traced  the  thin  thread  of  causality  back  from  a 
tremor  in  an  adult’s  hand  to  a long-forgotten  trauma  in  childhood.  He  has 


965 


Messages  from  Outer  Space 

mastered  the  complexities  of  transfinite  algebra  and  deciphered  the  histories  of 
unknown  men  from  speechless  stones.  He  has  freed  himself  from  the  grip  of 
Earth  and  swims  at  the  shores  of  the  universe.  These  achievements  of  the 
human  intellect  father  the  hope  that  man  will  solve  whatever  message  may 
come  from  the  stars.  Perhaps  some  day  Earth  will  be  enriched  by  the  profound 
knowledge  of  glittering  civilizations,  and  Man,  in  turn,  will  endow  them  with 
the  magnificent  creations  of  his  Shakespeares  and  the  noble  philosophies  of 
his  Christs.

This  is  not  a full  listing  of  all  works  used  in  the  writing  of  this  book.  Most  of  the 
sources  are  not  required  beyond  the  period  covered  by  a single  chapter,  and  full 
references  are  given  in  the  notes  to  each  chapter,  or  sometimes  in  those  for  the 
preceding  chapter  or  two.  If  references  are  widely  separated  they  are  repeated  in 
full.  The  notes  therefore  comprise  a kind  of  classified  bibliography  of  the  subject, 
and  to  repeat  the  works  in  a general  listing  would  serve  no  useful  purpose. 

Rather  this  is  a listing  of  some  of  the  more  important  sources  that  are  used 
throughout  the  book,  together  with  the  abbreviations  by  which  they  are  cited.  The 
cryptological  books  mostly  serve  to  give  information  on  cryptanalysis  for  cipher 
systems  mentioned  herein,  and  they  may  be  consulted  with  confidence  because  they 
are  good  solid  works.  Except  for  Gaines  and  Sacco  (in  French),  they  are  all  out  of

In  citations  to  Congressional  committee  hearings  and  reports,  I have  eliminated 
the  “United  States,  Congress”  that  should  precede.  They  thus  begin  with  “Senate”

Government  Printing  Office”  to  “GPO”  in  these  cases.  The  full  citation  “74th 
Congress,  1st  Session”  becomes  “74: 1 .”  The  term  “Hearings”  after  the  title  distin- 
guishes the  published  transcript  of  the  hearings  from  the  committee’s  report,  which 
often  bears  the  same  title.  "Senate,  Subcommittee  on  Internal  Security”  refers  to

NOTES  TO  TEXT 


A FEW  WORDS 


The  best  definitions  of  cryptologic  terms  in  English  today  are  to  be  found  in 
Webster's  Third  New  International  Dictionary  of  the  English  Language  Unabridged 
(Springfield,  Massachusetts:  G.  & C.  Merriam  Co.,  1961).  The  definer  was  Martin 
Joos,  Ph.D.,  professor  of  German  and  linguistics  at  the  University  of  Wisconsin,  a 
World  War  II  cryptologist  and  an  experienced  lexicographer.  The  definitions  are 
based  on  actual  usage.  For  a discussion  and  a list  of  the  cryptologic  terms  in  the 
dictionary,  see  my  Plaintext  in  the  New  Unabridged:  An  Examination  of  the  Defini- 
tions on  Cryptology  In  Webster's  Third  New  International  Dictionary  (New  York: 
Crypto  Press,  1963). 

I have  in  general  followed  these  definitions,  in  their  technical  senses.  In  a few 
places  I have  tried  to  fix  meanings  more  specifically,  and  here  and  there  I have 
invented  a word  where  one  seemed  needed  or  given  an  old  word  a new  meaning. 
Among  the  new  words  are  “cryptoeidography,”  meaning  the  encoding  of  pictures 
or  images,  and  “semagram,”  meaning  a steganographic  message  transmitted  by  any- 
thing other  than  letters  or  numbers,  as  by  the  order  of  cards  in  a deck.  The  chief  old 
word  that  has  been  given  a new  meaning  is  “steganography”  (ultimately  from  the 
Greek  steganos  “covered” +graphein  “to  write”).  This  was  the  original  term  for 
cryptography  (a  word  which  comes  ultimately  from  the  Greek  kryptos  “covered”  + 
graphein);  it  had  fallen  into  desuetude.  Following  the  suggestion  of  George  E. 
McCracken  in  “Athanasius  Kircher's  Universal  Polygraphy,”  Isis,  XXXIX 
(November,  1948),  215-228,  at  footnote  7,  I revived  it  and  assigned  it  as  the  term  so 
badly  needed  for  methods  that  conceal  the  very  presence  of  a secret  message. 

Naturally  all  books  on  cryptology  will  give  explicit  or  implicit  definitions  of 
terms;  the  best  of  these  is  Friedman;  more  compact  and  more  accessible  is  his 
article  “Cryptology”  in  the  Encyclopaedia  Britannica.  Most  complete  of  the  tech- 
nical glossaries  is  the  United  States  Army  Security  Agency’s;  more  recent  is  David 
Shulman’s  Glossary  of  Cryptography  (New  York:  Crypto  Press,  1961).  The  official 
definitions  of  a number  of  cryptologic  terms  are  given  in  United  States,  Department 
of  Defense,  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  Dictionary  of  United  States  Military  Terms  for 
Joint  Usage  (Washington,  D.C. : U.S.  Government  Printing  Office,  1 964),  and  United 
States,  Department  of  the  Army,  Dictionary  of  United  States  Army  Terms  (Army 
Regulations  320-5.  Washington:  1958).  (These  official  definitions  persist  in  making 
physical  and  personnel  security  part  of  signal  security.  But  while  physical  and 
personnel  security  are  undoubtedly  essential  to  signal  security,  they  are  not  essential 
to  it  alone.  They  extend  throughout  the  military  sphere.  It  thus  is  wrong  to  define

signal  security  in  terms  of  them.  They  are  accompanying  characteristics,  not  defining 
ones.  The  official  definitions  fail  to  see  this  distinction.  Interestingly,  however,  they 
do  not  make  the  complementary  activities  of  theft  and  betrayal  part  of  signal 
intelligence.)  For  other  places  where  cryptologic  definitions  may  be  found,  see 
Appendix  II  of  Plaintext  in  the  New  Unabridged. 


Chapter  i one  day  of  magic 

Since  the  question  of  responsibility  for  the  Pearl  Harbor  disaster  is  steeped  in 
such  bitter  controversy,  I feel  that  I should  make  known  my  views.  I believe  that  the 
theory  is  false  that  Roosevelt  and  his  cabal  teased  the  Japanese  into  attacking  to 
trick  a reluctant  United  States  into  the  war,  and  that  they  assured  the  Japanese 
success  at  Pearl  Harbor  by  withholding  vital  information  from  the  Hawaiian  com- 
manders. These  are  the  views  expressed  by  John  T.  Flynn,  Rear  Admiral  Robert  A. 
Theobald,  George  Morgenstern,  and  Charles  A.  Beard,  among  others,  in  their 
books  and  pamphlets.  I hold  that  Pearl  Harbor  resulted  from  Japanese  duplicity, 
audacity,  and  security;  from  the  difficulty  of  predicting  what  others  will  do;  from  a 
concatenation  of  dozens  of  minor  mistakes,  omissions,  false  assumptions,  and 
failures,  none  intentional;  from  a poor  administrative  setup  (most  evident  in  the 
defense  of  Hawaii  and  in  the  evaluation  of  intelligence);  and  from  the  unwillingness 
of  the  American  public  to  believe  war  likely  and  to  pay  for  military  preparedness. 
The  causes  of  Pearl  Harbor  were  not  one  but  many,  not  simple  but  complex — as 
are  the  causes  of  most  great  events. 

This  is  essentially  the  view  of  the  majority  of  the  Congressional  committee. 
Samuel  E Morison  gives  a short  but  devastating  rebuttal  of  Theobald  and 
the  other  revisionists  in  his  Two-Ocean  War  (Boston:  Little,  Brown  & Co.,  1963), 
69-76.  He  observes  that  a Japanese  defeat  at  Pearl  Harbor  would  have  better  served 
a warmongering  policy  by  preserving  the  forces  of  war.  The  most  thorough  analysis 
of  the  problem  is  Roberta  Wohlstetter’s  Pearl  Harbor:  Warning  and  Decision 
(Stanford,  Calif.:  Stanford  University  Press,  1962),  which  shows  the  difficulties  of 
detecting  the  true  signals  of  future  events  amid  the  roar  of  the  false.  After  the  fact, 
of  course,  the  true  portents  stand  out  in  high  relief,  whereas  the  others,  unneeded 
and  therefore  forgotten,  recede  into  the  background.  The  revisionists,  looking  back 
with  the  20-20  vision  of  hindsight,  select  the  true  indications  and  disregard  all  others, 
thus  making  it  appear  as  if  even  a deaf  and  blind  idiot  could  have  seen  Pearl  Harbor 
coming.  But  it  was  not  like  that  for  those  who  were  there. 

A problem  that  occupied  much  of  the  committee's  time  was  that  of  the  winds 
code  execute.  Safford  maintained  that  it  had  been  received  on  December  4 and 
suggested  that  all  records  of  it  had  been  destroyed  by  Marshall  and  King  to  cover 
up  their  failure  to  warn  Pearl  Harbor  {PH A,  8:3579,  3652,  3655-6,  3686-7).  The 
revisionists,  accepting  this  at  face  value,  argue  that  had  notification  of  the  winds 
execute  been  sent  to  the  Hawaiian  commanders,  it  would  have  alerted  them  suffi- 
ciently to  prevent  the  debacle.  Though  Safford  very  manfully  stuck  to  his  guns 
under  harrowing  cross-examinations,  I cannot  believe  his  story.  Too  many  other 
witnesses  who  would  have  seen  such  an  execute  had  it  been  received  testified  that 
they  never  did.  Consequently  I have  eliminated  from  my  account  all  references  to 


Notes

this  nonexistent  “true”  execute.  Furthermore,  I believe,  as  the  committee  majority 
did,  that,  even  if  it  had  been  received,  it  would  not  have  added  any  important 
information  to  what  was  already  known.  For  a detailed  discussion  of  the  matter,  see 
Appendix  E of  the  committee’s  report. 

I have  relied  almost  exclusively  upon  PH  A.  Its  39  parts,  or  volumes,  include  the 
hearings,  exhibits,  and  reports  of  the  seven  previous  Pearl  Harbor  investigations. 
The  joint  Congressional  investigating  committee’s  own  Report  is  entitled  Investiga- 
tion of  the  Pearl  Harbor  Attack , Senate  Document  No.  244,  79:2  (GPO,  1946), 
which  includes  the  minority  report.  Citations  in  the  form  33 : 765  always  refer  to 
PH  A. 

I regret  that  space  prohibits  my  identifying  the  witnesses  to  whose  testimony  the 
numbered  citations  refer.  The  multiple  references  result  sometimes  from  the  scatter- 
ing through  the  record  of  the  separate  items  that  go  to  make  up  a complete  state- 
ment, sometimes  from  my  supporting  the  detailed  statement  of  a less-than- 
authoritative  witness  with  a (briefer)  statement  by  the  best  witness.  In  general,  I 
have  documented  only  the  individual  cryptologic  data,  and  not  the  details  of  the 
Pearl  Harbor  strike  mission,  which  come  mostly  from  Walter  Lord,  Day  of  Infamy 
(New  York:  Henry  Holt  & Co.,  1957);  Mitsuo  Fuchida,  “I  Led  the  Air  Attack 
on  Pearl  Harbor,”  United  States  Naval  Institute  Proceedings , LXXVII  (September, 
1952),  939-952;  and  Samuel  E.  Morison,  The  Rising  Sun  in  the  Pacific,  1931- April, 
1942,  History  of  United  States  Naval  Operations  in  World  War  II,  vol.  Ill  (Boston : 
Little,  Brown  & Co.,  1950). 

In  the  notes,  “Report”  means  the  committee’s  report.  IMTFE  refers  to  the  pro-

Japanese  names  are  given  in  the  American  style,  with  family  name  last,  and  not 
in  the  Japanese  form,  with  family  name  first,  in  which  they  are  found  in  many  of 
the  sources.  Times  are  always  local  date  and  time,  and  I have  tried  to  indicate  this  in

1 | : 28,  1 : 37:  IMTFE,  Exhibit  2964,  affidavit  of  Kazuji  Kameyama,  Foreign 

Office  cable  chief,  gives  28  minutes  past  the  hour  as  the  time  of  trans- 
mission. PH  A,  14:1416,  from  American  intercept  records,  gives  18  minutes 
past  for  the  start  of  transmission  and  37  past  for  the  end.  In  view  of  the 
brevity  of  the  message  and  the  fact  that  the  equally  short  14th  part  took 
only  five  minutes  to  transmit  (14:1415),  I think  that  9 minutes  is  a more 
likely  time  for  transmission  than  19.  Accordingly,  1 have  used  the 
Japanese  figure.  These  two  references  serve  for  all  times  of  transmission 
and  interception  in  this  chapter.

2  after  5 a.m.:  my  estimate.  Decryptment  on  the  purple  machine  would  take 
“a  very  few  minutes  . . . less  than  fifteen”  (9:4001).  Brotherhood  does 
not  remember  whether  an  Army  translator  was  on  duty  by  4 a.m., 
which  suggests  that,  since  he  was  thinking  about  translation,  he  had 
decrypted  the  message  by  then,  but  does  remember  that  by  7 a.m.,  he 
had  made  one  or  two  trips  to  the  Army  office  (33 : 844).  Thus,  the  intercept 
went  to  the  Army  some  time  between  4 and  7 a.m.

57  9 a.m.,  “stunned  me”:  9:4517.  An  unsolved  question  is  why  this  message 

remained  in  S.I.S.  at  least  two  and  probably  four  hours,  when  it  would 
have  required  only  five  to  ten  minutes  to  translate  (8:3785).  Brotherhood 
brought  the  message  to  S.I.S.  for  translation  probably  a little  after  5 a.m., 
but  no  later  than  7 a.m.  (33:844).  Yet  it  had  not  come  back  to  oz  by 
9:30,  when  Kramer  left  to  deliver  the  14  parts,  nor  to  Bratton  by  8 a.m., 
when  he  had  arrived  at  his  office  (9:4516).  The  earliest  reference  to  it 
after  Brotherhood’s  is  Bratton’s  seeing  it  at  9 a.m.  I have  been  unable  to 
discover  any  reason  for  the  delay.  Would  speed  have  averted  Pearl 
Harbor?  Possibly,  but  I doubt  it.  A translation  on  Bratton’s  desk  by  8 
a.m.  might  have  enabled  him  to  catch  Marshall  before  his  Sunday  morn- 
ing horseback  ride  and  perhaps  get  a warning  out  much  earlier.  But  then 
there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  R.C.A.  in  Honolulu  would  have 
delivered  it  any  sooner  than  it  did.  Stark  had  not  wanted  to  send  another 
warning  on  the  basis  of  this  intercept,  and  his  seeing  it  at  8 a.m.  instead 
of  at  9:30  probably  would  not  have  changed  his  thinking.  Surprisingly, 
neither  the  Congressional  committee  nor  its  staff  nor  any  writers  on  the 
attack  ever  noticed  this  hiatus.

vigorously  attacks  the  whole  idea  of  hieroglyphic  cryptography.  I have 
tried  to  take  into  account  those  of  his  criticisms  which  seem  valid.  But 
too  many  other  Egyptologists  consider  the  inscriptions  in  question 
cryptographic  for  the  cryptography  to  be,  as  Fairman  says,  “a  figment  of

77  Sheshach:  almost  any  edition  of  the  Bible  will  cite  sheshach  as  a cipher  for 
Babel  or  Babylon.  The  earliest  traditional  reference  I could  find  was

Freedman  and  Maurice  Simon  (London:  Soncino  Press,  1939),  739.  The 
commentaries  on  Scripture  are  endless,  but  among  the  best  on  sheshach 
that  I have  found  are  “Sheshach”  in  Encyclopedia  Biblica,  eds.  T.  K. 
Cheyne  and  J.  Sutherland  Black  (New  York:  The  Macmillan  Company, 
1903),  which  proposes  “editorial  manipulation”  as  a probable  answer;

(New  York:  Henry  Frowde,  Oxford  University  Press,  1912),  20-21. 
Both  have  extensive  references.  Later  studies  do  not  add  anything.  Dr. 
John  Paterson,  Drew  University,  letter,  February  16,  1964,  suggests  that 
sheshach  may  be  “a  tour  de  force  on  the  part  of  a late  scribe.”  “Jeux  des

77  Leb  Kamai:  The  earliest  traditional  reference  that  I could  find  is  Targum 
Jonathan,  Jeremiah  51 : 1 ; I am  indebted  to  Harry  Sherman  for  a transla- 
tion of  the  latter.  "Leb-Kamai”  in  Encyclopedia  Biblica  suggests  that  the 
encipherment  could  be  “the  trifling  of  a scribe  in  athbash,”  but  could  also 
be  a corruption  of  other  words. 

77  atbash:  The  system  seems  never  to  be  explained  in  the  traditional  literature, 

only  used.  It  is  used  in:  Babylonian  Talmud,  Seder  Mo'ed,  Shabbath, 
104a,  trans.  Rabbi  H.  Freedman,  ed.  Rabbi  Isidore  Epstein  (London: 
Soncino  Press,  1938),  501-502;  Babylonian  Talmud,  Seder  Mo'ed,

Talmud,  Ta'anith,  III,  67a;  Pesikta  Rabbati,  43:181b,  for  the  translation 
of  both  of  which  I am  indebted  to  Harry  Sherman.  I am  grateful  to  Dr. 
Abraham  J.  Heschel,  professor  of  Jewish  ethics  and  mysticism,  Jewish 
Theological  Seminary  of  America,  for  these  references.  For  discussions,

78  albam:  notes  to  the  Midrash  Rabbah,  Soncino  edition,  at  739,  explain  albam. 

78  tabeel:  Despite  the  Midrash  Rabbah,  neither  “Tabeel,”  Encyclopedia  Biblica, 

nor  George  B.  Gray  and  Arthur  S.  Peake,  A Critical  and  Exegetical 
Commentary  on  the  Book  of  Isaiah,  International  Critical  Commentary 
(New  York:  Charles  Scribner’s  Sons),  118,  even  mention  a cipher,

79  handwriting  on  the  wall:  Daniel  5.  Montgomery,  262-264,  is  the  clearest 

explanation;  Gordon,  interview,  spring,  1963.  Babylonian  Talmud, 
Seder  Nizikin,  Sanhedrin,  22a,  ed.  Rabbi  I.  Epstein  (London:  Soncino 
Press,  1935),  121-122,  suggests  that  the  writing  was  in  atbash  or  a trans- 
position as  a possible  explanation  for  the  difficulty  of  solution;  no  evid- 
ence exists  to  support  either  hypothesis.  See  also  John  D.  Prince,  Mene

8,  July  24,  and  August  23,  1964.  A colleague,  John  R.  Walsh  of  the 
William  Muir  Institute  in  Edinburgh,  argues  strongly  in  letters  of  January 
26  and  February  18,  1964,  that  there  “never  was”  a science  of  cryptology 
among  the  Arabs.  He  regards  it  as  significant  that  Qalqashandi,  though 
an  official  of  the  chancellery,  had  no  first  hand  knowledge  of  the  subject 
and  “was  compelled  to  turn  for  information  to  what  was  probably  a 
merely  theoretical  treatise  by  a certain  Ibn  Duraihim.”  Moreover, 
“Amongst  the  millions  of  documents  preserved  in  the  Ottoman  archives, 
I have  yet  to  hear  of  one  being  written  in  code.”  These  are  strong  argu- 
ments, but  I feel  that  the  tone  of  the  Qalqashandi-Ibn  ad-Duraihim  work 
could  have  come  only  from  experience  with  cryptology  and  that  Qal- 
qashandi’s casual  reference  to  “thorough  probes  into  all  letters”  is  too 
weighty  to  be  denied.  Consequently,  though  moderating  Bosworth’s 
probably  extravagant  view,  at  19,  that  “the  use  of  codes  for  administra- 
tive and  diplomatic  purposes  became  widespread,”  I have  regarded  both 
cryptography  and  cryptanalysis  as  fairly  well  known  in  the  Moslem  world. 
My  text  reflects  this.

in  the  series,  as  January-July  1589.  Since  this  will  identify  the  volume,  I have 
thought  it  unnecessary  to  burden  these  notes  with  full  dates  and  places  of  publication

The  Lavinde  document  has  sometimes  been  called  the  first  book  on 
cryptology,  but  since  it  is  nothing  more  than  a collection  of  cipher 
alphabets,  it  does  not  deserve  that  title.  Perhaps  the  oldest  modern 
Western  discussion  of  cryptography,  as  distinct  from  its  mere  use,  is 
the  “Occulte  Scribendi  Modus”— apparently  a monalphabetic— in 
British  Museum,  Sloane  Mss.  No.  416,  f.  155r,  dated  April  19,  1455.

board in  trying  to  prove  that  everything  was  an  Italian  first,  is  generally  accurate  and

In  this  article  Friedman  observed  that  Alberti  “suggests  a two-part 
arrangement  of  the  contents  of  the  code,  thus  deserving  the  credit  for 
being  first  to  describe  (if  not  to  invent)  this  important  feature.’  It  is  true 
that  Alberti  describes  the  two-part  arrangement  when  he  says:  “It  may 
be  advisable  for  me  to  have  two  tables  and  for  you  likewise  to  have  two;

in  one  set  the  numerals  will  be  arranged  in  order  at  the  beginnings  of  the 
lines  conveniently  for  the  reader;  in  the  other  set  the  phrases  will  be 
alphabetically  arranged  under  the  headings  of  the  letters  so  that  they  will 
not  have  to  be  looked  up  in  various  headings  in  the  table  and  may  be 
readily  at  hand  for  the  writer."  But  the  purpose  of  a two-part  arrange- 
ment is  increased  secrecy,  and  1 do  not  think  that  Alberti  was  thinking  of 
this.  He  did  not  specifically  say  that  the  numbers  must  stand  in  mixed 
order  against  the  plaintext  as  he  did  for  the  ciphertext  letters  on  his  disk, 
while  he  specifically  did  refer  to  the  convenience  of  the  arrangement.  It  is 
difficult  to  assign  motives  at  a range  of  half  a millennium,  and  on  principle 
I would  prefer  to  rest  upon  purely  objective  evidence;  but  since  the 
secrecy  that  is  an  essential  element  of  cryptography  is  a human  desire, 
motives  must  be  weighed.  As  Friedman  said,  Alberti  has  described  a 
two-part  code  (though  not  in  thoroughly  mixed  order),  but  on  the  ground 
that  he  did  not  intend  secrecy  in  making  two  code  lists,  I deny  that  he 
invented  the  two-part  code,  in  the  full  sense  of  the  term.  The  invention 
belongs  to  Antoine  Rossignol.

explanation  of  the  woodcut  without  ever  realizing  that  it  was  used  in  an 
earlier  work  (with  the  single  slight  change  of  a lamp  into  a crozier).  This 
throws  into  doubt  his  attribution  of  the  woodcut  to  Hans  Springinklee,

the  mercy  of  the  Allies;  he  traces  German  cryptology  to  Selenus,  who 
does  little  more  than  comment  on  Trithemius.  I think,  however,  that  the 
reasons  for  the  German  emphasis  on  cryptography  are  to  be  found  else- 
where than  in  Latin  books  which  the  later  authors  probably  never  read ; 
likewise  the  reasons  for  the  Allied  successes.

158  Hesdin,  reticence,  no  solutions:  Tallement,  I,  256-258.  Bazeries,  at  45,  thinks 
that  Tallement  is  wrong  in  his  charge  of  no  solution,  but  concedes,  at 
47,  that  he  could  find  none  of  Rossignol's  cryptanalyses  in  the  archives. 
However,  he  seems  not  to  have  investigated  the  archives  of  the  Ministere 
des  Affaires  Etrangeres,  in  which— to  take  one  volume  of  many— 
Correspondance  Politique,  Angleterre,  47,  contains  much  correspondence 
of  1638-1639  between  Charles  I and  Britain’s  ambassadors  in  England. 
This  was  almost  certainly  intercepted  and  cryptanalyzed,  probably  by 
Rossignol,  although  the  documents  bear  no  annotations  specifying 
their  provenance.

is  based  on  an  interview  with  Mme.  Jean  Yon,  Bazeries’  daughter,  but  is 
dangerously  unreliable  in  relating  Bazeries’  cryptologic  career.  As  just 
one  instance  of  many,  Sourbes  gives  1876  as  the  date  of  an  incident  that 
Bazeries  himself  says  occurred  in  1890.  In  addition,  the  conclusion — 
that  Bazeries  solved  cryptograms  enabling  the  French  to  place  their 
forces  to  halt  the  Germans  at  the  Battle  of  the  Marne — is  false.  These 
cryptograms  were  not  solved  until  after  the  battle,  according  to  the  chief 
of  the  cryptologic  bureau  at  G.H.Q.,  Givierge,  vi.  Some  additional

Second  Revisions  that  terrify  all  but  the  professional  Dreyfus-case  experts,

or  foolhardy— soul  who  wants  to  spelunk  among  them  to  do  so,  I have 
thought  it  better  not  to  burden  these  notes  with  point-by-point  references 
to  the  primary  sources.  I have  checked  the  primary  sources  to  make 
certain  of  the  accuracy  of  all  statements  in  the  two  articles  bearing  on

2 message,  which  he  says  was  not  fully  solved.  Paleologue,  Matton,  and

appear  in  the  message,  which  is  also  false.  On  the  basis  of  whatever  he 
meant  he  alleged  that  “All  the  groups  No.  10  and  No.  17  correspond 
to  interchangeable  expressions;  now,  this  condition  is  realized  in  Version 
No.  2.  Thus  Version  No.  1 can  apply  to  the  authentic  ciphered  text.”

Chapter  g ROOM  40 

Because  of  the  importance  of  the  Zimmermann  telegram,  a note  on  major 
printed  sources  might  not  be  inappropriate.  Admiral  Sir  William  James,  The  Eyes  of 
the  Navy:  A Biographical  Study  of  Admiral  Sir  William  Had  (London:  Methuen, 
1956),  also  published  in  New  York  the  same  year  by  St.  Martin’s  Press  as  The 
Code  Breakers  of  Room  40,  based  his  Zimmermann  telegram  chapter  upon  Hall’s 
own  story  of  it  in  his  uncompleted  autobiography  and  Hall’s  papers;  James 
was  himself  administrative  head  of  Room  40  later  in  the  war.  Burton  W.  Hendrick, 
The  Life  and  Letters  of  Walter  H.  Page  (Garden  City:  Doubleday,  Page  & Co., 
1925),  III,  ch.  12,  “The  Zimmermann  Telegram,”  331-364,  gives  much  material 
unobtainable  elsewhere,  but  does  not  cite  any  sources  and  seems  in  error  in  a 
few  places.  Barbara  W.  Tuchman,  The  Zimmermann  Telegram  (New  York:  Viking 
Press,  1958),  is  a masterly  study  of  the  political  circumstances  surrounding  the  tele- 
gram and  its  publication.  Unfortunately,  it  was  written  before  the  declassification 
on  January  20,  1965,  of  William  F.  Friedman  and  Dr.  Charles  J.  Mendelsohn,

Mendelsohn,  a professor  at  the  College  of  the  City  of  New  York,  served  as  a

presumably  assisting  in  the  work;  but  James  states  in  his  letters  that  the 
lists— or  at  least  that  for  July,  1916,  which  is  typical— include  several  who 
did  not  make  much  of  a contribution  or  were  only  occasional  helpers, 
and  omitted  several  who  did  much  more  and  much  better  work  than 
those  so  listed.  I have  therefore  followed  his  recommendations.  On  Father

convert  until  September,  1917)  worked  in  the  War  Office  and  does  not

1931),  17.  This  is  an  interview  with  Ewing,  in  which  Church  states  that 
“The  deciphering  of  the  code  used  by  Bernstorff,  the  German  Ambassador 
to  the  United  States,  took  nearly  six  months  and  involved  the  piecing 
together  of  thousands  of  scraps  of  paper  resembling  an  immense  jig- 
saw puzzle.”  He  adds  that  “In  this  code  the  name  given  to  the  German 
Foreign  Office  was  ‘Arthur  Foxwell.’  ” This  must  be  a Room  40  play  on 
Zimmermann's  first  name  and  his  attempts  at  deception.  German 
diplomats  were  not  using  jargon  codes,  and  if  they  were  Room  40  would 
not  have  taken  six  months  to  solve  one.

283  partial  text:  The  two  sources,  James,  136,  and  Hendrick,  336-337,  appear 
to  be  different  copies  from  the  original  partial  solution.  I have  collated 
them  with  each  other  and  with  the  final  German  text.  Unsolved  portions 
are  indicated  by  ellipses  between  parentheses,  questionable  readings  by 
parentheses,  extremely  questionable  readings  by  question  marks  within 
the  parentheses.  The  single  question  mark  is  given,  with  ellipses,  by  both 
James  and  Hendrick,  but  what  it  indicates  is  not  clear,  since  in  the  Ger- 
man text  only  the  words  “to  keep  Stop”  appear,  and  these  are  given  in 
the  English  partial  solution.  The  bracketed  “of  Mexico”  is  my  insertion.

Nauen  to  Sayville,  but  Friedman  and  Mendelsohn,  7-8,  c:ive  strong 
evidence  against  the  likelihood  of  this  channel’s  being  used  for  the 
Zimmermann  telegram,  and  I have  therefore  omitted  it.  Finally,  GFO 
gives  only  the  American  route  for  the  message,  which  may  mean  that  the 
Zimmermann  telegram  did  not  go  by  the  Swedish  roundabout.  Oppo- 
sing this  is  the  fact  that  important  messages  between  Washington  and 
Berlin  were  frequently  transmitted  by  several  routes  to  ensure  their 
reception.  The  archivist.  Royal  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Sweden, 
says,  in  letter  of  June  1,  1966,  that  German  telegrams  “were  in  fact 
brought  to  the  Ministry  from  the  German  Embassy  in  Stockholm  for 
further  delivery  to  the  Royal  Telegraphic  Service,  where  they  later  were 
burnt.”  Nor  were  copies  kept  either  by  the  Ministry  or  the  Swedish 
mission  in  Argentina.  No  copies  of  the  codetext  in  0075  thus  seem  extant, 
except  those  in  the  Room  40  archives.

only  partially  solved  at  this  time  are  reinforced  by  a statement  of  Page  s 
in  a telegram  of  September  10,  1917,  that  the  Zimmermann  telegram 
“went  in  a code  which  the  British  had  at  that  time  only  partly  succeeded

solution  explains  why  the  section  concerning  dismemberment  of  the 
U.S.  was  not  present  in  the  first  partial  solution  that  Montgomery  showed

289  Code  13040:  GFO  for  distribution;  David  Kahn  [pseud.  Ishcabibel],  “A 
Partial  Reconstruction  of  a German  Diplomatic  Code,”  The  Cryptogram, 
XXVIII  (September-October,  1960),  1,  4-7,  for  construction  of  code; 
also  Friedman  and  Mendelsohn,  15-16.  Hall’s  affidavit  states  that  “The 
German  cipher  book  covering  this  system  of  ciphering  [Code  13040] 
is  in  our  possession,  it  having  been  captured  by  the  British  authorities 
in  the  luggage  of  a German  consul  named  Wasmuss  who  was  stationed 
at  Shiraz  while  Wasmuss  was  engaged  in  an  endeavor  to  cut  a British  oil 
pipe  line.”  This  story  is  elaborated  by  James,  69,  and  Tuchman,  19-21. 
But  it  must  be  some  lapse  of  memory  on  Hall’s  part.  As  Friedman  and 
Mendelsohn  remark,  at  17,  “It  seems  unlikely  that  a German  consul  en- 
gaged in  an  expedition  to  cut  a pipe  line  should  carry  a diplomatic  code 
book  in  his  baggage.”  They  suggest  that  the  British  found  parallel  plain  and 
code  messages  in  Wassmuss’  baggage.  According  to  GFO,  13040  was 
never  distributed  to  Wassmuss  nor  to  any  German  missions  in  Persia. 
However,  other  codes  were,  and  the  British  discovered  “two  ‘dictionary’ 
cyphers”  wrapped  in  several  pairs  of  long  woolen  underwear  in  the 
German  consulate  at  Bushire,  Persia,  on  March  9,  1915  (C.  J.  Edmonds, 
“The  Persian  Gulf  Prelude  to  the  Zimmermann  Telegram,”  Journal  of 
the  Royal  Central  Asian  Society,  XLVII,  January,  1960,  58-67  at  65), 
and  perhaps  Hall  confused  that  code  with  13040.  It  is  not  known  what 
code  Wassmuss  did  have.  Hall  did  not  make  his  statement  to  cover  up 
British  cryptanalysis  because  earlier  in  hisaffidavit  hestated  that  sometimes 
“our  cipher  experts  were  able  to  decipher  the  German  ciphers.”  Whatever 
the  reason  for  Hall’s  statement  about  a capture,  it  seems  certain  that  Room 
40  solved  and  did  not  capture  13040.  Friedman  and  Mendelsohn,  17, 
point  out  that  the  copy  of  13040  given  by  Britain  to  the  United  States 
after  America  entered  the  war  gives  every  evidence  of  being  a reconstruc- 
tion, comprising  about  half  the  vocabulary  with  words  and  phrases  from 
all  sections  and  with  some  identifications  marked  as  doubtful,  and  GFO 
reports  that  German  archives  show  no  reports  of  loss  or  compromise 
of  that  code.  My  text  reflects  my  belief  that  13040  was  cryptanalyzed. 
Consequently,  I have  excluded  the  romantic  stories  of  Wilhelm  Wassmuss 
and  of  Alexander  Czek,  who  is  supposed  to  have  stolen  a German  diplo- 
matic code,  which  in  any  case  may  not  have  been  1 3040  or  0075  but 
any  of  the  others;  Hall  in  any  event  denied  any  knowledge  of  Czek 
(Robert  Boucard,  Les  Dessous  des  Archives  Secretes  [Paris:  Les  Editions 
de  France,  1929],  69-83).

291  Britain  deliberately  holds  the  message  for  release:  No  evidence  exists  for  this 
crucial  statement.  That  many  historians  agree  in  it  (views  summarized  in 
Samuel  R.  Spencer,  Decision  for  War,  1917  [Rindge,  New  Hampshire: 
Richard  R.  Smith,  1953],  at  62-64)  means  little,  since  they  were  un- 
aware of  the  underlying  cryptologic  and  espionage  problems.  Friedman 
and  Mendelsohn,  26-28,  believe  that  the  desire  to  protect  the  espionage 
secrets  motivated  the  delay,  and  both  they  and  Mrs.  Tuchman,  who  has 
made  the  closest  study  of  the  political  circumstances,  think  that  the 
timing  of  giving  the  note  to  the  Americans  was  based  on  political  factors. 
I concur  in  these  conclusions.  No  evidence  exists  for  any  different  reason 
for  the  release,  either.

for  details,  see  chapter  on  Russian  cryptology.  I believe  that  this  activity 
did  not  spread  to  the  West  because  no  cryptanalytic  organization  existed 
to  disseminate  methods  and  results,  because  the  fronts  were  widely 
separated  and  theater  commanders  almost  independent,  and  because 
solutions  occurred  even  in  the  East  only  rarely  and  haphazardly,  and  at 
great  distances  from  one  another.

began  to  be  used  by  Berlin  to  communicate  with  its  troops  on  the  Eastern 
Front.  These  messages  bore  the  indicator  richi  in  the  preamble,  in 
contrast  to  those  on  the  Western  Front,  which  were  prefaced  by  chi 
(the  ri  from  “orient”?).  Both  prefaces  were  followed  by  the  number  of

French  knew  German  intentions  by  May  30,  which  would  be  before 
the  Painvin  solution.  But  Recouly,  who  wrote  much  more  closely  to  the 
event,  and  Palat,  who  is  the  official  French  military  historian,  specifically 
credit  the  munitions  cryptogram  with  alerting  the  French  to  the  attack. 
I believe  that  Foch  was  simply  a few  days  off  in  the  question  of  warning. 
The  message — which  has  recently  been  given  the  name  of  “le  radiogramme 
de  la  victoire”  in  French  cryptologic  literature — is  also  mentioned  in

77-79.  It  should  be  recorded  that  in  1932  the  then  Captain  W.  A.  van 
der  Beck,  a Dutch  officer  stationed  in  Batavia  and  assigned  to  solve 
Japanese  codes,  singlehandedly  solved  an  early  edition  of  the  Japanese 
la  code.  He  made  his  initial  break  by  correctly  guessing  that  certain 
repeated  codegroups  in  circular  telegrams  represented  addresses.  The 
solutions  helped  the  Dutch  fend  off  tough  Japanese  demands  in  a trade 
conference  (van  der  Beck,  letters,  March  25,  April  23,  June  16,  1962).

398  invention  of  the  one-time  system:  Though  Vernam  invented  the  pulse  adding 
device,  no  clear-cut  contemporary  record  states  who  invented  the  crypto- 
graphic method  that  accompanied  it — the  one-time  system.  Following 
is  the  evidence  on  which  I base  the  conclusions  that  my  text  embodies. 

Vernam  seems  to  have  evolved  the  randomness  of  the  key.  Parker  and 
Vernam’s  co-worker,  Ralph  E.  Pierce,  both  credit  him  with  it,  and  though 
no  other  evidence  supports  them,  none  contests  them  either.  Because 
Vernam  had  had  no  prior  interest  in  cryptology,  I think  it  likely  that  he 
created  the  random  key  in  an  unthinking  way — “let’s  punch  out  some 
characters  for  the  key” — rather  than  first  making  up  a coherent  key  and 
then  realizing  its  cryptographic  weaknesses  and  deciding  to  nullify  them 
with  a random  key.  This  requirement  of  randomness,  which  is  not  stated 
either  in  Vemam's  or  Morehouse’s  patents  or  in  the  A.  T.  & T.  files  on 
either,  is  first  mentioned  in  Vernam’s  Journal  of  the  A.I.E.E.  article, 
p.  113. 

The  first  mention  of  nonrepetition  of  polyalphabetic  keys  that  I have 
found  anywhere  in  cryptology  occurs  in  a Parker  Flitt  “Memorandum 
for  Chief  of  Staff”  dated  May  19,  1914:  “No  message  is  safe  in  the 
Larrabee  cipher  unless  the  key  phrase  is  comparable  in  length  with  the 
message  itself”  (Hitt  Papers).  This  was  written  about  six  months  after 
Mauborgne  had  left  the  Army  Signal  School  for  the  Philippines,  but  the 
statement,  which  stands  without  argumentative  support,  seems  so  positive 
and  unquestioned  as  to  imply  a fairly  long  period  of  acceptance.  Con- 
sequently, I think  it  probable  that  it  was  formulated  with  Mauborgne 
present,  quite  probably  with  his  assistance,  and  that  he  adapted  the 
principle  to  the  Vernam  machine  keys. 

Before  I discovered  this  mention  in  the  Hitt  Papers,  I had  asked  both 
Mauborgne  and  Parker  who  invented  the  nonrepetition  feature.  Mau- 
borgne replied  (letter,  March  5,  1963)  that  “yes,  I did  it.”  (While  he  was 
referring  to  the  work  with  Vernam,  this  may  support  the  probability  of 
his  participation  in  the  formulation  of  the  principle  at  the  Army  Signal 
School.)  Parker  (letter,  March  4,  1963)  and  Pierce  (interview)  both  denied 
Mauborgne’s  claim,  asserting  that  Vernam  invented  the  feature.  How- 
ever, while  the  A.  T.  & T.  files  not  only  contain  no  reference  supporting 
Vernam,  they  do  include  documents  corroborating  several  statements 
that  Mauborgne  made  in  his  letter.  Moreover,  without  going  into  details, 
I believe  that  the  line  of  development  implied  by  the  Mauborgne  claim 
is  more  likely  than  that  urged  by  Parker  and  Pierce,  and  some  evidence 
that  the  implied  Mauborgne  line  of  development  actually  happened 
comes  from  engineer  Donald  B.  Perry  (letter,  July  1,  1963).  Admittedly, 
Perry  did  not  join  A.  T.  & T.  until  June,  1920,  and  so  his  testimony 
is  at  second  hand,  but  he  was  a colleague  of  Vernam’s  on  the  cipher 
machine  from  those  early  days.  Pierce’s  memory,  incidentally,  seems 
influenced  by  a Parker  memoir  on  the  subject;  his  is  not  an  entirely 
independent  recollection.  But  in  any  case  I think  that  the  Hitt  statement 


Notes

fairly  well  settles  the  matter  in  favor  of  Mauborgne,  though  the  proof  is 
not  absolute. 

All  this  seems  to  call  for  the  conclusion  that  Mauborgne  welded  the 
two  elements  together,  and  I have  consequently  used  it,  even  though  no 
documentary  evidence  exists  for  it.  Other  Vernam  co-workers  threw  no 
light  on  the  question  of  invention  (David  E.  Branson,  letter,  June  26, 
1963;  Roy  B.  Shanck,  interview,  August  9,  1963).  The  National  Archives 
could  not  find  any  documents  filed  by  Mauborgne  at  the  time  of  his 
work  with  the  Vernam  machine,  nor  any  report  filed  by  Lieutenant 
Griffiths. 

398  unbreakable:  William  F.  Friedman  states  in  his  article,  “Cryptology,”  in 
the  Encyclopaedia  Britannica  that  “a  letter-for-letter  cipher  system 
which  employs,  once  and  only  once,  a keying  sequence  composed  of 
characters  or  elements  in  a random  and  entirely  unpredictable  sequence 
may  be  considered  holocryptic,  that  is,  messages  in  such  a system  cannot 
be  read  by  indirect  processes  involving  cryptanalysis,  but  only  by  direct 
processes  involving  possession  of  the  key  or  keys,  obtained  either  legiti- 
mately, by  virtue  of  being  among  the  intended  communicators,  or  by 
stealth.”

415  1917:  Interference  77,716,  Hebern  brief.  This  date  is  crucial  because  it 

awards  the  priority  of  the  rotor  invention  to  Hebern  even  though  his 
application  for  a rotor  patent  was  not  filed  until  after  two  other  inven- 
tors had  filed  theirs.  The  1918  date  of  construction  is  corroborated  by 
the  statement  printed  in  1922  that  the  first  machine  was  “completed 
about  four  years  ago. ”(H.  H.  Dunn,  “Electrical  Machine  Can  Make  Eleven

Hardie  has  made  an  excellent  translation.  Several  other  translations 
exist,  including  a French  one;  to  facilitate  reference  I cite  the  paper  by

his  interviews.  As  for  the  papers  listed  in  the  bibliography:  Pers  z hid 
them  under  the  eaves  of  Burgscheidungen  Castle  when  the  Americans 
captured  Pers  z.  But  when  Schauffler  and  Rohrbach  sent  one  of  Rohr- 
bach’s  students  to  bring  the  box  back  from  the  castle,  which  was  in  the 
Soviet  zone  of  occupation,  the  caretaker  of  the  castle  tipped  off  the 
Russians.  They  confiscated  the  box  as  the  student  was  waiting  with  it 
at  the  railroad  station.

to  get  the  French  ciphers  resulted  from  plans  to  invade  North  Africa. 
But  this  operation  was  not  definitely  decided  upon  until  July,  1942, 
several  months  after  the  request  was  made,  and  I think  it  much  more 
likely  that  Madagascar  was  the  stimulant  for  the  request,  particularly 
in  view  of  Churchill’s  request  for  “extreme  vigilance  about  any  [French] 
convoys”  (VI,  227).  An  illustration  of  the  French  superencipherment  tables

of  the  Italian  Navy  code  communication  department  during  the  war, 
said  the  code  used  by  the  warships  in  the  Cape  Matapan  battle  was

it  was  used  only  between  the  ships  and  naval  headquarters  in  Rome

archives  report  that  Oshima’s  dispatches  were  destroyed  in  air  raids

self burned  all  his  papers  and  does  not  recall  any  such  report  (letter, 
June  5,  1964).  In  addition.  General  Sir  John  F.  M.  Whitely,  intelligence 
chief  for  Eisenhower,  does  not  recall  the  intercept  (letter,  August  16,

Pers  z solved);  United  States  Strategic  Bombing  Survey,  Japanese 
Intelligence,  31.  Paschke  for  1930  start  of  one-time  pad.  Beurling  cited 
some  technical  details  of  how  he  failed  to  solve  the  messages  but  recovered 
some  serial  numbers  that  indicated  a one-time  pad  to  him.  These  inde- 
pendent, widespread,  repeated,  and  highly  circumstantial  admissions 
make  the  failure  to  solve  Russian  diplomatic  messages  perhaps  the  best 
attested  fact  of  World  War  II  cryptology.  Yet  during  1941  at  least,  the 
German  consul  at  Harbin,  Manchuria,  repeatedly  forwarded  to  Berlin 
“intercepted”  Soviet  diplomatic  messages  from  Moscow  (DGFP , XII, 
250-251,  793;  some  telegrams  from  Harbin  are  at  T-120: 105:1 1 31 16-7, 
T- 1 20 : 1 07 : 1 13431  —2,  which  I have  examined).  Harbin  was  usually 
forwarding  German  translations  of  the  Russian  messages  three  days 
after  they  were  sent  from  Moscow.  Though  none  of  my  sources  indicated 
that  the  Russians  used  ciphers  of  a lower  grade  than  the  one-time  pad 
for  diplomatic  purposes.  I think  that  this  is  the  most  likely  explanation, 
particularly  in  view  of  the  fact  that  all  the  Harbin  intercepts  appear  to  be 
circulars  to  all  missions.

In  fact  the  Ransom  quote  is  two  paragraphs  long  and  ends  with  “world-wide  scale.”) 

I have  relied  extensively  upon  the  following  Department  of  the  Air  Force 
Manuals  dealing  with  Air  Force  Communications-Electronics  Doctrine  (CED): 
Basic  Concepts,  Missions,  and  Functions  with  Communications-Electronics  Applica- 
tions, Air  Force  Manual  100-11;  C-E  Publications  and  Training,  Air  Force  Manual

munications Complex  ( AIRCOM ),  Air  Force  Manual  100-32,  published  at  times 
ranging  from  1959  to  1962.  They  categorize  their  topics  according  to  a CED 
number,  such  as  CED  1105.4b.  The  first  two  digits  are  the  same  as  the  number  of 
the  manual  in  the  100  series;  CED  1105.4b  is  thus  in  Air  Force  Manual  100-11. 
The  other  digits  refer  to  sections,  paragraphs,  and  subparagraphs.  1 use  CED 
numbers  in  all  my  citations  because  of  their  brevity  and  because  they  are  more 
likely  to  remain  unchanged  through  various  editions  and  corrections  than  page 
numbers. 

All  government  agencies  issuing  the  documents  cited  are  understood  to  be  those 
of  the  United  States,  except  in  the  case  of  a few  British  agencies,  indicated  as  such. 

At  several  points  in  this  chapter,  I have  used  the  word  “probably  or  the  verb 
“may”  to  indicate  that  the  statement  is  my  own  supposition.

Votes  were  not  recorded.  An  identical  bill  in  the  80th  Congress,  2nd

material  that  had  been  enciphered,  such  as  diplomatic  telegrams,  was 
vigorously  denounced  in  the  House  {Congressional  Record,  XCI  [October

758  hypocrisy:  The  basic  hypocrisy  is,  of  course,  doing  the  communication 

intelligence  and  pretending  or  claiming  that  one  is  not  doing  it.  A more 
subtle  example  appears  in  the  Radio  Regulations  of  the  International 
Telecommunications  Union,  drawn  up  at  the  International  Radio- 
communication Conference  at  Atlantic  City  in  1947.  The  signatory 
nations  here  appear  to  be  safeguarding  the  privacy  of  international 
radio  communications,  but,  in  fact,  by  a weaseling  insertion  of  the  term 
“authorize,”  give  themselves  a license  to  invade  that  privacy.  Ch.  IX, 
Art.  21,  "Secrecy,”  reads:  “[§485]  The  administrations  bind  themselves 
to  take  the  necessary  measures  to  prohibit  and  prevent:  [§486]  a)  the 
unauthorized  interception  of  radiocommunications  not  intended  for  the 
general  use  of  the  public;  [§487]  b)  the  divulgence  of  the  contents,  simple 
disclosure  of  the  existence,  publication  or  any  use  whatsoever,  without 
authorization,  of  information  of  any  nature  whatever  obtained  by  the 
interception  of  the  radiocommunications  mentioned  in  486.'  The  sig- 
natories include  the  major  powers  of  the  earth,  including  the  U.S.  and  the 
U.S.S.R.  Signing  for  Italy  was  radio  expert  and  cryptologist  Luigi  Sacco.

764  cipher  mechanisms:  In  the  U.S.  Patent  Office,  inventions  dealing  with 

cryptology  are  classed  in  the  following  classes  and  subclasses — what 
the  Patent  Office  calls  the  '‘field  of  search  for  cryptography.”  Not  every 
patent  in  these  classes  deals  with  cryptography.  Class  35,  “Education,” 
Subclasses  2-4,  for  cryptography  generally;  Class  197,  "Typewriting 
Mechanisms,”  Subclass  4,  for  cryptographic  typewriters;  Class  283, 
“Printed  Matter,”  Subclasses  11  and  17,  for  cryptographic  printed  matter; 
Class  178,  “Telegraphy,”  Subclass  5.1  for  secret  facsimile  and  secret 
television.  Subclass  22,  for  secret  telegraphy;  Class  179,  “Telephony,” 
Subclass  1.5,  for  secret  telephony;  Class  325,  "Modulated  Carrier  Wave 
Communication  Systems,”  Subclasses  32-35  and  122,  for  modulated 
carrier  wave  systems  involving  secrecy;  Class  116,  “Signals  and  Indi- 
cators,” Subclasses  18-20,  for  code  signaling  generally;  Class  340, 
“Communications,  Electrical,"  Subclasses  345-365,  for  electrical  com- 
munications involving  code  converters  and  transmitters;  Class  234, 
“Selective  Cutting,”  Subclasses  69-70,  94-108,  for  cutting  or  punching 
involving  coding.  A list  of  the  patents  in  each  of  these  subclasses,  as 
well  as  the  patents  themselves,  may  be  purchased  from  the  Patent 
Office.  (U.S.  Patent  Office,  letters,  November  21,  1962,  and  November  17,

It  turned  out  to  be  a bad  choice  to  illustrate  the  ignorance  of  inventors, 
because  I have  since  found  that  in  the  earliest  exposition  1 know  of  this 
system  (“Systemes  de  Cryptographic,”  Revue  Scientifique  [March  24, 
1888]),  the  author,  one  Pomey,  thoroughly  analyzed  the  structure  of  the 
system  mathematically.  This  did  not  lead  him,  however,  to  the  technique 
of  solution.

Philadelphia:  J.  B.  Lippincott  Co.,  1912),  I,  270-271.  Rabelais’  Third 
Book,  ch.  20,  has  an  episode  involving  symbolism.  Notes  by  ed.  Jean 
Plattard  in  the  edition  Les  Textes  Fran^ais  (Paris:  Editions  Fernand 
Roches,  1929)  say  that  Zoroaster  never  wrote  anything  on  letters  hard 
to  understand  and  that  if  Bossus,  a grammarian  contemporary  with 
Domitian,  ever  wrote  the  book  cited,  it  is  unknown.  Notes  by  eds. 
Jacques  Boulenger  and  Lucien  Scheler  in  the  edition  of  the  Bibliotheque 
de  la  Pleiade  (Paris:  Galiimard,  1955),  say  that  Zoroaster  is  a grammarian 
of  the  time  of  Domitian  and  that  Bossus  and  his  alleged  book  are  un- 
known. I can  find  nothing  about  ciphers  of  Zoroaster’s  and  nothing  at 
all  about  Bossus.  N&Q,  9:3:128,  refers  to  a “Cyphral  Dispatch”  at  end

Friedman,  “Shakespeare,  Secret  Intelligence,  and  Statecraft,”  Proceed- 
ings of  the  American  Philosophical  Society,  CVI  (October,  1962),  401-411, 
demonstrates,  in  my  opinion,  that  the  proofs  of  guilt  that  Henry  shows 
the  traitors  are  indeed  the  intercepted  letters.  But  I think  Friedman  has 
fallen  victim  to  an  unnecessary  interpretation  when  he  argues  that  the 
letters  had  been  enciphered  and  that  Henry’s  agents  had  cryptanalyzed 
them.  His  arguments  are  purely  hypothetical  and  without  basis  in  the 
play.  One  might  as  well  suppose  that  the  letters  were  also  in  invisible 
ink.  The  original  documents  had  no  effect  on  Shakespeare’s  play,  of 
course,  but  M.  McGuinness  of  the  Public  Record  Office  wrote  on  May  9,

“This  cryptograph,”  765  for  “much  shorter  time,”  760  for  “in  one-fifth,” 
778  for  "The  most  profound.” 

786  “far  beyond  the  ordinary,”  “native  power”:  Wimsatt,  778.  Wimsatt’s 

article  is  the  definitive  study  of  Poe’s  cryptology  and  stands  up  extremely 
well  under  scrutiny;  most  of  its  judgments  are  valid,  and  I am  indebted 
to  it  for  the  framework  of  my  own  study,  but  I think  that  here  Wimsatt’s 
lack  of  familiarity  with  the  practice  of  cryptanalysis  has  led  him  astray. 
This  charge  cannot  be  leveled  against  William  F.  Friedman,  who  con- 
cludes his  “Poe”  article  with  the  judgment  that  “Had  he  [Poe]  an  oppor- 
tunity to  make  cryptography  a vocation,  there  is  no  doubt  that  he  would 
have  gone  far  in  the  profession.”  But  this  is  a pure  guess,  not  even  based 
on  the  evidence  of  the  Alexander's  articles,  which  had  not  then  been 
discovered,  and  its  force  seems  to  be  negated  by  a nearby  sentence 
(280):  “Against  his  will  he  [the  serious  student  of  cryptography]  is  driven 
to  the  conclusion  that  Poe  was  only  a dabbler  in  cryptography.”  Even 
Poe  never  claimed  to  be  anything  else.  Moreover,  the  article  is  unfair 
to  Poe,  evaluating  him  from  a modern  and  not  a contemporary  point 
of  view.  It  belittles  what  the  achievement  of  a polyalphabetic  solution 
would  have  been  in  those  pre-Kasiski  days  and  taxes  Poe  with  not  know- 
ing some  things  (about  Renaissance  cryptology)  that  no  one  else  in 
his  time  knew.  The  article  was,  nevertheless,  the  first  study  of  Poe’s 
cryptography.  In  sum,  1 think  that  the  Wimsatt  and  Friedman  judgments 
of  an  exceptional  cryptanalytic  ability  for  Poe  are  unwarranted.

1,568  arm  and  leg  positions  form  the  cipher  symbols  of  a small  code 
in  which  Holmes  recorded  a secret  account  of  Moriarty’s  gang.  He  bases 
this  upon  the  equivalence  between  the  1,568  possible  positions  and 
the  statement  that  Bazeries,  after  solving  a nomenclator  of  Antoine 
Rossignol  (which  Pratt  calls  Rossignol's  “Great  Cipher,”  which  it  was 
not),  “reported  that  the  possible  total  of  characters  was  exactly  1,568.” 
This  statement  is  false:  Bazeries  never  said  any  such  thing.  (Emile

systems  used  by  criminals.  They  simply  review  the  basic  elements  of 
cryptology,  giving  perhaps  a single  example-which  in  most  cases

place  in  the  country  that  broadcasts  scrambled  television  is  New  York 
City’s  Channel  31,  which  televises  pictures  of  criminal  line-ups  to  half  a 
dozen  police  precinct  houses,  saving  detectives  and  witnesses  from  having 
to  go  down  to  headquarters  to  view  suspects;  the  pictures  are  scrambled 
to  protect  the  rights  of  suspects  (“20  Police  Stations  Get  Television  Sets

F90  1 1660-3;  the  Archives  catalog  says  they  were  used  in  the  July 
Monarchy  and  the  Restoration  (1830-1848).  The  Musee  Postal  at  Paris

840  Primrose:  Frank  J.  Primrose  vs.  The  Western  Union  Telegraph  Co.,  154 

U.S.  1.  The  case  was  heard  in  the  October  term,  1893,  and  decided  May 
26,  1894.  The  opinion  of  the  court  was  delivered  by  Justice  Horace  Gray, 
with  only  Justice  John  Marshall  Harlan  (grandfather  of  the  Justice  of  the 
same  name  appointed  by  President  Eisenhower)  dissenting — as  was  his 
wont.  The  decision  cites,  at  pages  32  and  33,  other  cases  involving 
errors  in  cipher  messages.  Two  later  cases  are  128  Southeastern  Reporter 
500,  involving  a change  from  bluffness  to  bluffing  in  a 1923  message 
and  causing  a loss  of  $663,  in  which  the  North  Carolina  Supreme  Court 
ruled  for  the  telegraph  company,  and  35  Southern  Reporter  190,  in  which 
alike  was  received  as  alive  in  1892,  causing  a loss  of  $304.89,  and  in 
which  the  Mississippi  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  customer  was  entitled 
to  recover  that  amount — the  only  court  to  do  so.  The  other  cases 
involving  telegraphic  error — 31  Southern  Reporter  222  and  18  Southern 
Reporter  425 — became  tangled  in  jurisdictional  problems  and  were  not 
settled  on  the  basic  question.  References  to  other  legal  problems  of  cipher- 
message  transmission  may  be  found  in  American  Jurisprudence  under 
“Cipher"  and  “Telegraphs  and  telephones — cipher  messages,”  Corpus 
Juris  Secundum  under  “cipher,”  “cipher  messages,”  and  “code  book,” 
Words  and  Phrases  under  “cipher,  cipher  dispatch  or  message,"  and 
Abbott  New  York  Digest  under  "Cipher  messages”  and  “Telegraphs  and 
Telephones — cipher  messages."  Many  of  these  other  cases  involve  the 
failure  to  deliver  a message,  such  as  245  New  York  Reports  284,  or  the

these  cases,  one  sometimes  comes  across  famous  names.  245  N.Y.R. 
284  was  argued  for  the  appellant  by  Vincent  R.  Impellitteri,  later  mayor 
of  New  York,  and  was  decided  by  Judge  Benjamin  R.  Cardozo,  later  a 
great  U.S.  Supreme  Court  justice.  139  N.  Y.S.  289  was  decided  by  Justice 
Samuel  Seabury,  later  to  gain  fame  as  the  man  who  cleaned  up  Jimmy 
Walker's  New  York.

(New  York:  W.  A.  Benjamin,  1963),  a valuable  collection  of  reprints  and  original 
contributions  by  several  authors  on  the  problem,  but  unfortunately  rather  repeti- 
tious and  badly  arranged.  I have  cited  authors  and  titles  in  it  only  where  neces- 
sary. “Sullivan”  refers  to  Walter  Sullivan,  We  Are  Not  Alone:  The  Search  for  In- 
telligent Life  on  Other  Worlds  (New  York:  McGraw-Hill,  1964),  a very  thorough 
and  workmanlike  discussion  on  which  I have  leaned  heavily.  All  references  in  the

INDEX 


THE  INDEX  covers  only  the  cryptological  aspects  of  this  book.  Thus,  although  there 
is  a passage  describing  Japan’s  war  strategy,  the  index  does  not  cite  it  because 
cryptology  played  no  essential  role  in  it.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  a reference  to 
the  Battle  of  Midway  because  cryptology  was  crucial  to  it.  Subjects  that  are  discussed 
in  relation  to  cryptology  are  listed  under  their  names;  thus,  music  in  cryptology  is 
listed  under  “music”  and  not  under  “cryptology,  music  in.”  The  major  subject  head- 
ings such  as  “cryptography,”  deal  only  with  that  subject  when  it  is  considered  as  a 
whole  in  its  various  aspects.  In  general,  they  are  cross-referenced  to  entries  of 

coordinate  value.  ...  . . , , , 

There  are  few  chronological  references  because  the  books  structure  is  largely 

chronological,  but  there  are  geographical  and  national  entries. 

To  cite  every  occurrence,  or  even  just  major  occurrences,  of  a common  general 
system,  such  as  polyalphabetic  substitution,  would  make  an  entry  so  long  as  to  be 
useless!  But  rarer  systems,  as  polygraphic  substitution,  or  specific  named  systems,  as 
pa-k2,  are  listed  in  all  essential  occurrences.  In  such  headings  the  term  “code  or 
“cipher”  is  omitted.

David  Kahn,  a journalist,  has  been  an  amateur 
cryptologist  since  1943.  He  has  written  popular 
articles  on  the  subject  for  The  New  York  Times 
Magazine  and  Scientific  American;  he  has  also 
written  technical  analyses  of  different  types  of 
ciphers  for  The  Cryptogram,  a publication  of  the 
American  Cryptogram  Association.  One  of  his 
studies  has  been  republished  by  the  Central  Intel- 
ligence Agency.  Mr.  Kahn  is  president  of  the 
American  Cryptogram  Association  and  for  many 
years  was  president  of  the  New  York  Cipher  So- 
ciety. His  collection  of  works  on  cryptology  is 
among  the  most  extensive  in  the  world. 

Mr.  Kahn,  born  in  1930,  grew  up  in  Great  Neck, 
New  York.  He  received  a B.A.  from  Bucknell  Uni- 
versity and  from  1955  to  1963  was  a reporter  for 
the  Long  Island  daily  Newsday.  He  worked  on 
The  Codebreakers  for  two  years  part  time  and 
two  and  a half  years  full  time,  drawing  his  mate- 
rial from  interviews  with  cryptologists,  unpub- 
lished documents  in  archives,  and  scholarly 
works.  In  1965  he  became  a news  desk  editor  for 
the  European  edition  of  the  New  York  Herald 
Tribune  in  Paris,  and  later  returned  to  Great 
Neck.
